[00:19:10] her off for VV cuz my CA is on it I just
[00:19:14] [ __ ] around with my builds
[00:19:16] um kaai on no bless which is a bit of a
[00:19:19] jump scare uh oh yeah Ben it's on
[00:19:22] [ __ ] instructor this is the first you
[00:19:24] know this is probably the first time
[00:19:25] I've put been on instructor in like 3
[00:19:27] years I actually can't remember the last
[00:19:29] time I took Bennett off of n bless uh so
[00:19:32] that's a criminal offense so I got to
[00:19:34] put him back on [ __ ] n bless uh yeah
[00:19:39] your face is a jump scare dude shut like
[00:19:42] why would you say
[00:19:44] that what compelled you to say that K
[00:19:47] it's a th000 bits uh your message got
[00:19:50] autom modded cuz you said your crab
[00:19:55] ass and apparently I don't AAL you or
[00:19:58] you missed the the thing so I'm going to
[00:20:01] write the wrong and review your Alam
[00:20:03] apparently let's see they said please
[00:20:06] don't look at Alam but since you didn't
[00:20:07] name another character I'm going to
[00:20:08] assume you want me to look at alyam what
[00:20:10] is
[00:20:14] this what is this
[00:20:17] alyam um level 81 light of fure incision
[00:20:22] Mari chose I mean sure I guess if you're
[00:20:25] playing with finina that you know that
[00:20:26] works um
[00:20:31] literally furina
[00:20:41] Baro
[00:20:45] mods wait wait leak the feet picks dude
[00:20:52] what I don't think I have ever okay I
[00:20:55] actually think it's literally impossible
[00:20:57] to overcap on crit with with Alam
[00:20:59] without [ __ ] Mar help me focus on my
[00:21:02] homework there is something deeply wrong
[00:21:04] with me but thank you like okay let's do
[00:21:06] the theoretical theorem right actually
[00:21:08] no it's definitely it's okay it's
[00:21:09] possible but like okay cuz like let's
[00:21:12] say have no M should say right you're at
[00:21:13] 70 crit rate how do you get more CR rate
[00:21:16] here you can't so we're stuck at 70 here
[00:21:18] you could get maybe like let's say 10%
[00:21:20] more probably not you're probably not
[00:21:22] hitting 20 but like okay let's say 15
[00:21:24] that's 5% more here you're getting like
[00:21:26] 15 that's 20 here you can't get more
[00:21:28] here you could get like it's like you'd
[00:21:30] have to have perfect crit rate on every
[00:21:32] piece anyways this was good guild the
[00:21:35] dream better though with okay with
[00:21:37] finina basically every character's every
[00:21:40] character's best in slot is either
[00:21:42] marish if they don't have a signature
[00:21:44] and if they have a signature Mar is
[00:21:46] either slightly better or slightly worse
[00:21:48] so it's like it's still it's like as
[00:21:49] good but you're overcapping on crit rate
[00:21:51] so it's like not quite as good is he
[00:21:53] okay is he lost man like I would go uh
[00:21:56] gilded but it's still it's fine

[00:52:21] read it all but I know the TA so I'll
[00:52:23] give it to you here just wondering two
[00:52:26] things one is really cool the other one
[00:52:28] is little pogers uh is it artifact
[00:52:30] presets no is it uh new endgame content
[00:52:34] Abyss no is it [ __ ] uh a doore no but
[00:52:37] it's cool wait let me turn my heater on
[00:52:39] okay
[00:52:40] so treasure
[00:52:42] Compass shows the treasure on the mini
[00:52:45] map which is really cool that's POG it
[00:52:47] should have been there for like this is
[00:52:48] sick this is cool right now I don't have
[00:52:50] to [ __ ] look around like a [ __ ] AB
[00:52:51] Bozo that's
[00:52:53] cool uh second of all
[00:52:59] this is the only other thing I saw this
[00:53:02] I think is sick it gives you a uh
[00:53:05] pfp a profile picture of a bunch of
[00:53:08] story Quest people so you could be like
[00:53:10] jet from valerant you could be uh
[00:53:13] [ __ ] I don't know people so that's
[00:53:16] cool for World quest now something you
[00:53:19] might know about me is I am an avid
[00:53:21] quester okay I've done every World quest
[00:53:23] in the game every story Quest every
[00:53:25] Hangout everything that's not true but
[00:53:28] so what I'm thinking is we try to get
[00:53:31] all the
[00:53:32] avatars we try to get all the avatars
[00:53:35] except the one that makes that like
[00:53:37] except I'm not doing orob bashit Legacy
[00:53:39] [ __ ] that little [ __ ] I don't okay I
[00:53:41] don't actually know who orob Bashi is if
[00:53:43] they are a cool person I apologize and I
[00:53:45] respect them and their legacy I just
[00:53:47] want that to be clear I don't know who
[00:53:48] orob Bashi is however I don't want to do
[00:53:51] that Quest because it will stop the
[00:53:53] light it's a snake Okay [ __ ] that snake
[00:53:55] it will stop the lightning in this
[00:53:58] island that I already 100% did and
[00:54:00] that's exclusive so we're not doing that
[00:54:02] one but every other one I will do that's
[00:54:04] a
[00:54:08] goal bucko thanks for four months
[00:54:10] stylish thanks for two
[00:54:13] months hbd budy that's Ki Nation
[00:54:17] lore is
[00:54:19] it okay but like dude we've been over
[00:54:22] this I love kakomi but I'm not a big fan
[00:54:25] of of of of of the way they they did
[00:54:26] some of her writing okay like she's
[00:54:28] supposed to be a like a military General
[00:54:30] strategist and a mermaid okay that's who
[00:54:33] she is and then you do some of the story
[00:54:35] Quest and she's
[00:54:36] like traveler oh my
[00:54:39] God
[00:54:45] anyways I need the triple crowner though
[00:54:48] I actually just have not killed
[00:54:53] specters anyways uh so that's what's
[00:54:55] coming in the optimization I don't know
[00:54:57] why I'm I'm getting so off topic today
[00:54:59] uh I
[00:55:00] apologize I'm sorry for being mean to
[00:55:06] aashi what the [ __ ] is this what Dev
[00:55:09] team need to optimize in my opinion no
[00:55:11] more fake 100% completion of regions
[00:55:14] show us xx% okay let the compass inform
[00:55:17] us not only a reveal chest but hidden
[00:55:20] gimmicks like challenges burries and
[00:55:23] riddles this just asking them to baby
[00:55:26] you you okay lowkey true um I'm going to
[00:55:31] be
[00:55:37] honest you should play look at the
[00:55:39] Cowboy Hau
[00:55:43] art I would be very tilted if like I'd
[00:55:48] rather okay I don't know if this is a
[00:55:49] bad take because I've hear I've heard a
[00:55:50] lot of people comment about this so
[00:55:52] maybe I'm in the minor like the I'm in
[00:55:54] the minority here but I
[00:55:57] swear it's more it would be more
[00:56:00] annoying if I was like 99.9 and I
[00:56:02] couldn't find the last chest than if
[00:56:04] they just show me a 100 and I don't I
[00:56:05] lose one common chest like yeah I want
[00:56:07] the one common chest I I do okay but
[00:56:10] like dude I would be so tilted if I'm at
[00:56:12] 99.9 forever but like I I wish I wish
[00:56:15] there was a way to know if there was
[00:56:17] missing a chest like I you know that'd
[00:56:18] be cool but like I don't know what is
[00:56:21] that resin okay in the year 1090 one
[00:56:24] second
[00:56:32] [ __ ] dude what the [ __ ] happened in 1090
[00:56:35] I don't
[00:56:40] know I don't
[00:56:43] know so I think that's everything
[00:56:45] outside of the live stream which we're
[00:56:46] going to watch later um tomorrow morning
[00:56:49] later tonight technically uh it was also
[00:56:52] de's
[00:56:53] birthday we love de
[00:57:01] yeah there's a new [ __ ] furry
[00:57:04] event I don't know how to feel about it

[00:57:08] battle pass is yeah this is Criminal
[00:57:12] this is a smooth criminal dude okay yo

[00:57:20] getting at the 50 don't worry I've never
[00:57:22] not 50 it don't worry don't worry don't
[00:57:23] worry um training guide
[00:57:27] a bit weak try leveling
[00:57:31] up type a boba if you like a boba type
[00:57:34] balls if you like balls balls
[00:57:40] balls did you miss collect it once okay
[00:57:43] one time I I had it level 50 but I
[00:57:45] didn't press claim all because I I wait
[00:57:48] till the end to do that on stream for
[00:57:49] content and then I got no rewards and
[00:57:52] then in Star rail they mailed me the
[00:57:53] rewards when I forgot
[00:57:57] now you might be like Z you're [ __ ]
[00:57:59] stupid it's your fault for not claiming
[00:58:02] absolutely however you know it
[00:58:06] sucks anyways cuz like okay it doesn't
[00:58:09] make sense for like a a normal player to
[00:58:11] not just claim all the time but I like I
[00:58:13] don't know I like building it up it's
[00:58:14] like hype it's like I I I want I like it
[00:58:17] when there's like a a safe like bed to
[00:58:20] fall back on right let's say one day I'm
[00:58:22] out of Mora okay and this happens a lot
[00:58:24] okay this happens a lot I'm off often
[00:58:26] times out of Mora it it's just a common
[00:58:28] occurrence I like to be able to be like
[00:58:30] oh [ __ ] you battle pass boom I have Mora
[00:58:34] anyways uh did I buy the new [ __ ] in the
[00:58:36] shop I did wait I did well I didn't buy

[00:58:57] Mora [ __ ] I have farmed more lay
[00:59:00] lines than days you have been on this
[00:59:03] Earth probably not unless you're like
[00:59:05] four but the hero's journey
[00:59:08] 1430 I have done 1430 lay lines it's not
[00:59:11] like I don't do lay lines okay I do but
[00:59:14] I have to level every [ __ ] character
[00:59:16] in the game and every artifact in the
[00:59:18] game and every weapon in the game
[00:59:26] only 1430 is that the how is that rookie
[00:59:35] numbers that you don't play I do dailies
[00:59:38] and [ __ ] usually so it's like the only
[00:59:40] moras I'm like missing is the the finite
[00:59:43] ones so like the ones that I can do
[00:59:45] anytime like there's World quest I
[00:59:46] haven't done I'll admit it oh oh cut cut
[00:59:48] I'll admit cut cut I'll admit it but I
[00:59:51] can do those anytime so it's not like I
[00:59:52] I lost them they're right there they're
[00:59:54] here boom I did the events like the the
[00:59:58] [ __ ] the the the the the potion

[01:00:38] yes it it gives HP and then energy when
[01:00:41] you heal from all Fields so it's POG the
[01:00:44] only thing that's usually like fav is
[01:00:45] better for team energy but that one
[01:00:47] gives her energy so you know but dude
[01:00:51] not everyone has 24 favs man like if you

[01:07:41] these do you need those for fluff sound
[01:07:51] Fairman yeah damn imagine [ __ ] not
[01:07:54] having fast dring
[01:08:00] okay thank
[01:08:02] you does newbie weapon work on Hau
[01:08:05] without furina in the party
[01:08:13] uh it's crit damage so it's never going
[01:08:16] to be useless but please just put finina
[01:08:17] in the
[01:08:20] party wait what are the other stats that
[01:08:23] are unconditional is it just crit damage
[01:08:24] yeah HP yeah the rest is
[01:08:28] conditional like I don't know I I always
[01:08:30] say like 88 crit damage is never going
[01:08:32] to be useless like it's never going to
[01:08:34] be like bad it's just
[01:08:36] like if you get the effect it'll be good
[01:08:38] if you don't it's just going to be like
[01:08:40] eh but if you get the effect which you
[01:08:43] should if you have finina if you don't
[01:08:44] it'll be if you like take damage it only
[01:08:46] lasts for 4 seconds though so even if
[01:08:47] you take damage or you heal once it's
[01:08:49] not going to be a long time low base
[01:08:51] attack yeah but still right you might
[01:08:53] run benett you might have no blast you
[01:08:54] might have well you're playing hazo so
[01:08:55] maybe not but also are you playing hazo
[01:08:57] without Fina H yes but if you are sorry
[01:09:01] you could play like taser or something
[01:09:02] which actually isn't bad if you're
[01:09:03] playing Tas you don't really have attack
[01:09:04] Buffs so it might actually be worse than
[01:09:06] Alternatives in that case because you
[01:09:07] don't have attack Buffs 808 CR damage is
[01:09:09] still good but uh yeah low base attack
[01:09:11] will hurt

[01:21:01] if you're in
[01:21:04] chat I'm just going to review your Soo
[01:21:06] because we like Soo uh he's on staff of
[01:21:08] the Scarlet Sans he is
[01:21:10] C2 okay I respect that
[01:21:14] 689 that's
[01:21:18] okay uh gilded dreams I like that I'm
[01:21:21] I'm a thundering Fury enjoyer Z tried to
[01:21:23] review a Soo without mentioning
[01:21:24] thundering Fury challenge failed once
[01:21:26] again but you know gilded is good uh
[01:21:29] flower
[01:21:31] is it's it's it's useful there's you
[01:21:34] know there's some useful stats here it
[01:21:36] could be better it it could be better
[01:21:38] but it's useful feather is pretty good
[01:21:42] uh that's like 30 crit value it's not
[01:21:44] bad
[01:21:55] it's actually not bad okay okay I'm I'm
[01:21:58] harsh cuz I'm I was I look we're a
[01:22:01] little harsh cuz we're expecting but for
[01:22:03] like a a this is like a average this is
[01:22:05] like a average can probably can
[01:22:08] definitely clear floor 12 Soo like if
[01:22:10] you have a decent team you can you can
[01:22:12] clear like this is this flower is kind
[01:22:13] of mid but your feather's good I mean
[01:22:15] this is not even bad
[01:22:17] like it's just it's it's mediocre it's
[01:22:20] not a flex but it's not bad like you can
[01:22:22] clear with this the ratio is fine the ER
[01:22:25] is good uh well it depends on your team
[01:22:27] but I'm going to say 140 is good and 348
[01:22:30] em it's pretty
[01:22:33] good um yeah it's not bad is your what's
[01:22:37] your neet like marish Shi that's uh very
[01:22:40] low rolls but every substat is good so
[01:22:42] it's not bad uh except I don't know if
[01:22:44] you need ER on to like to nlet usually
[01:22:46] doesn't really need much er uh but a
[01:22:47] little bit like 16 is fine also you have
[01:22:49] what the
[01:22:52] [ __ ] I mean okay you have I know you're
[01:22:55] gaining like 36 here but still 36 plus
[01:22:59] 20 is not that high but you know it's
[01:23:02] it's fine
[01:23:05] um oh wait this is an easy
[01:23:09] fix uh
[01:23:12] that's okay oh that's actually really
[01:23:14] good this is actually really good this
[01:23:15] is an easy fixer never let this is an
[01:23:17] offset circlet just go boom pick a crit
[01:23:19] rate ciret that has a little bit of crit
[01:23:21] damage and you're good cuz if you have a
[01:23:22] crit rate circlet you immediately go to
[01:23:24] 50 plus what 36 that's like 86 is crit
[01:23:28] rate with still over 200 crit damage cuz
[01:23:31] even without your circl you're over 200
[01:23:32] crit damage so you're good you can also
[01:23:34] HP Circle it that's true but I I think
[01:23:36] you need crit raate more right now cuz
[01:23:37] you have a lot of HP Subs right HP Subs
[01:23:39] HP Subs uh well that's HP main stat 10%
[01:23:43] Like You know you have a decent amount
[01:23:44] of
[01:23:47] HP h
[01:23:58] okay well
[01:24:00] uh
[01:24:02] yeah yeah so just change your ciret uh
[01:24:06] keep fing Mar you'll get some better
[01:24:07] pieces but your flower is pretty good
[01:24:09] and your goblets also pretty good so
[01:24:11] it's mostly your sand that's mid and
[01:24:12] your your feather's okay it's just low
[01:24:14] rolls but it's not bad yeah wait what
[01:24:17] about your other characters C2 C6
[01:24:20] Kaza what the [ __ ] how do you C6 this
[01:24:22] guy I guess you lost g50s Fin's [ __ ]
[01:24:26] C6 what the
[01:24:31] hell
[01:24:36] uh I feel like your goblet should be
[01:24:38] better like I know it has HP but I feel
[01:24:40] like with finina you can choose HP or
[01:24:43] Hydro goblet it doesn't really matter so
[01:24:45] like there's a decent chance you might
[01:24:46] have a HP goblet that's better than this
[01:24:48] realistically
[01:24:50] but anyways
[01:24:56] tyari had his own Banner buddy yeah but
[01:24:59] you're not pulling on that like you're
[01:25:00] not cixing him off of that Banner if you
[01:25:03] are I I would like to have a word with

[01:40:44] the English word like I studied in
[01:40:47] French prosecuted that's the
[01:40:51] word that's the word
[01:40:54] persecuted means death yeah I don't want
[01:40:56] them to die okay anyways LW 56 uh let's
[01:41:00] look at your account so so far I'm
[01:41:02] seeing good characters and kaching she's
[01:41:04] pretty good she's pretty good uh yolan
[01:41:06] Aqua simulakra emblem severed fate
[01:41:10] C1 and double
[01:41:12] crown I'm just going to look at your
[01:41:14] ratio okay this is a good yon I mean you
[01:41:16] have no ER though
[01:41:21] um bro you don't need advice sorry sorry
[01:41:24] calm down calm down calm drink
[01:41:28] water um so the thing I hate about yolon
[01:41:33] players breaking my silence my story
[01:41:36] about yolon players they always have six
[01:41:38] ER and they they're like oh it's
[01:41:40] actually enough in my team cuz I'm
[01:41:41] running seven Hydro characters so I've
[01:41:43] learned not to mention ER but typically
[01:41:46] you would want more now in your defense
[01:41:47] you have C1 and you also probably are
[01:41:50] running for Rena if that's the case fine
[01:41:53] uh uh but you know you may need ER okay
[01:41:56] you may need it you may but you have C1
[01:41:59] you probably e and then e even though e
[01:42:01] feels like a waste of my life it it's
[01:42:03] worth you know pressing it
[01:42:06] uh Hut okay advice number one you want
[01:42:09] more em than 77 typically um you have a
[01:42:11] level 80
[01:42:15] hom
[01:42:18] shanas
[01:42:20] see1 level five burst bro level your
[01:42:30] burst that's insane that's really good
[01:42:34] you could go em sand as well by the way
[01:42:36] especially if you don't have a lot of em
[01:42:37] but oh yeah also level normal attacks
[01:42:39] yeah um
[01:42:42] but you like I would go em sand my em is
[01:42:45] this low but this is a really good sand
[01:42:46] so I it's fine keep it but try to get
[01:42:48] some yeah sub
[01:42:49] stats um
[01:42:54] leveling versus okay this is this is
[01:42:57] fine actually leveling versus shim I
[01:43:00] can't
[01:43:02] it's are you guys playing okay okay okay
[01:43:05] okay okay okay okay if you are I don't
[01:43:10] care what a [ __ ] I don't care what
[01:43:12] anyone else tells you okay this is what
[01:43:14] I'm saying right now if you are playing
[01:43:16] cut without your burst get the [ __ ] off
[01:43:19] Shima I don't care it's not that good I
[01:43:21] don't care strong box Tri of witch use
[01:43:23] guilded dreams mag should say with
[01:43:25] finina I don't care you're not supposed
[01:43:27] to never burst with Shas you just don't
[01:43:30] burst that often you skill you do your
[01:43:32] rotation you get particles back you
[01:43:33] burst at the end Yahoo and then you get
[01:43:36] it back when you're on your supports if
[01:43:37] you're not bursting at all why are you
[01:43:40] on the
[01:43:42] set or like okay let's say you don't get
[01:43:45] enough particles in your rotation then
[01:43:47] use it at the end of your last rotation
[01:43:49] like whichever one to kill the enemy
[01:43:51] because it's more charge attack damage
[01:43:52] okay okay cool wow
[01:44:00] 50% but like whenever the enemy's low HP
[01:44:03] burst so you're going to need to burst
[01:44:05] cuz it saves you a lot of time and it
[01:44:06] front loads it gives you a bunch of
[01:44:07] frontload of damage so you might as well
[01:44:09] [ __ ] level the [ __ ] you're not going
[01:44:11] to not
[01:44:12] burst if you don't burst at all why
[01:44:14] wouldn't you run shim okay if you don't
[01:44:15] burst at all don't play Hut I'm sorry
[01:44:17] [ __ ] you I'm sorry gatekeeping Hut [ __ ]
[01:44:20] you use your burst it's good it's it's a
[01:44:23] good ability it's good it has it's good
[01:44:26] it's actually
[01:44:28] good it's good what are you talking
[01:44:30] about just don't
[01:44:33] burst this isn't yo Mia even yo Mia
[01:44:48] bursts anyways I like like I like sha on
[01:44:52] her but like you shouldn't never
[01:44:59] burst anyways
[01:45:11] um if you're playing VV Vape with
[01:45:13] Bennett why do you burst are you are
[01:45:16] you okay it's okay I I don't need to
[01:45:18] talk right now uh what is this kcom on
[01:45:23] this might be just substats 40K HP 210
[01:45:25] ER this might just be a substat
[01:45:33] moment ah I'm going to move on this is
[01:45:36] fine actually I don't know what how much
[01:45:38] are you
[01:45:39] have weapon yeah this is fine yeah
[01:45:42] that's fine
[01:45:48] Nita that's fine you should level your
[01:45:50] weapons though that's
[01:45:54] kind of mid but it's fine it's on
[01:45:56] set that's F your mem's pretty low are
[01:46:01] you on Fielding her no you're not okay
[01:46:03] get ah get more em please get H so if
[01:46:06] you're on
[01:46:08] field if you're on field I I don't mind
[01:46:10] crit Nita like dendro crit I I play that
[01:46:13] but if you're off field it's still
[01:46:15] viable it's just worse than em and your
[01:46:18] goblet isn't good enough to be better
[01:46:20] than just cuz like it's not like the sub
[01:46:22] stats are good right if the substats
[01:46:23] were good you can go crit dendro but
[01:46:25] like the substats are kind of whatever
[01:46:27] so you might as well go em if you have
[01:46:28] it um you are C2 which is nice uh you
[01:46:33] can level your burst as well burst is
[01:46:35] not like the most important but it's not
[01:46:37] worth not leveling flop Ren okay that's
[01:46:46] based yeah why are your weapons level 80
[01:46:51] are you low what's your AR oh 50 okay I
[01:46:53] mean you you should still be 90 though
[01:46:55] before you like artifact
[01:46:57] Farm
[01:46:59] um but yeah try try to get your weapons
[01:47:02] to 90 if you
[01:47:04] can also please don't play saop with uh
[01:47:11] kitching that's fine that's also fine
[01:47:15] that's not great but it's
[01:47:18] okay yeah I mean you seem to know what
[01:47:22] you're doing but you're like under
[01:47:23] leveling a lot of stuff like a lot of
[01:47:24] your talents are not leveled and a lot
[01:47:26] of your weapons like even Kaza like
[01:47:28] you're 5.57 so Kaza you should level
[01:47:31] everything uh if anything burst is less
[01:47:33] important than like skill and and normal
[01:47:35] but you should level everything
[01:47:38] um Ryden doesn't matter cuz you're full
[01:47:42] em but yeah a lot of your talents and
[01:47:44] and uh weapons should be higher level
[01:47:45] that's that's the main thing
[01:48:04] versus higher priority if you skill once
[01:48:06] for rotation I'm pretty sure it is I
[01:48:07] mean I guess it depends where you're
[01:48:09] doing but they're all they're all pretty
[01:48:11] important if you if you if you skill
[01:48:14] twice I'm pretty sure skill is
[01:48:16] better I mean it's not that hard to
[01:48:18] check like that's not something you need
[01:48:19] a guide for right you could just do um
[01:48:21] for Kazo in particular you can just see
[01:48:23] how many times you're using your skill
[01:48:24] cuz so where is he the [ __ ]
[01:48:27] isazo uh level 90 should be here 62 m
[01:48:32] you just do this
[01:48:34] 15,22 on both of them well how many
[01:48:36] times are you
[01:48:38] Skilling this is what plus 20 plus 23 no
[01:48:43] 26 20 and 26 wait no but you're not
[01:48:45] holding you're just tapping so plus 20
[01:48:47] and then this one is
[01:48:51] plus yeah okay level burst but if you're
[01:48:54] Skilling more multiple times cuz it has
[01:48:56] a 6C cool down this has [ __ ] uh 15 so
[01:48:59] yeah but you should level burst anyways
[01:49:01] it doesn't matter the level all of them
[01:49:04] like you're
[01:49:08] 558 did I con my resin if I didn't I
[01:49:10] will be very mad at you
[01:49:25] anyways Vermilion wait why am I playing
[01:49:27] this team though I don't even need
[01:49:28] friendship

[01:51:56] man that dude that chatter ruined my
[01:51:58] whole mood I'm actually dude I'm
[01:52:00] actually tilted at the fact that players
[01:52:02] exist who don't press Q on Hut you're
[01:52:05] just playing with one ability it
[01:52:06] actually like ruined my entire mood it

[01:52:29] up okay but like why like dude you lose
[01:52:33] you lose eye frames you lose healing you
[01:52:35] lose a huge burst of damage that helps
[01:52:37] you finish off enemies when your charge
[01:52:39] attack is like 100k and your burst is
[01:52:41] like 5 n
[01:52:44] 400 I don't
[01:52:51] know and also extends your [ __ ]
[01:52:53] rotation but I don't

[02:03:12] as well plunge actually there's no
[02:03:14] reason not to I'm what am I going to
[02:03:15] play
[02:03:17] G hilly CH silly ch
[02:03:22] hilly Billy Shang Ling yeah but I get
[02:03:27] okay yeah yeah
[02:03:28] okay I don't play plun Dow play sh no no
[02:03:31] I I okay I don't hate plung Dow it's
[02:03:33] fine I just usually play if I'm playing
[02:03:35] cuz I play plunge all day [ __ ]
[02:03:36] when I want to play like I'm playing
[02:03:38] plung Shia or plung duuke when I want to
[02:03:40] spice things up I'm playing [ __ ]
[02:03:42] plung
[02:03:44] da she's on my duuke build though I
[02:03:47] changed her artifacts okay never mind I
[02:03:49] don't know what the [ __ ] she's on hello
[02:03:51] Mr Z what's up I heard you were a fellow
[02:03:53] Soo enjoyer I pulled c all the way back
[02:03:56] in sumeo but didn't know how to build
[02:03:58] him but recently I found you and your
[02:04:01] guide and I built him but I still can't
[02:04:03] clear Abyss with him and I'm stuck on
[02:04:05] Abyss 12 to one with him can you tell me
[02:04:08] what's wrong with my build 67 M1 74,900
[02:04:21] this is what my biggest problem with
[02:04:24] Sino was on release like my biggest like
[02:04:27] your coming was foretold this is like my
[02:04:30] biggest this was my biggest Improvement
[02:04:33] to soo
[02:04:34] okay when the the situation where Soo
[02:04:37] doesn't feel like a wor kaching is in
[02:04:39] quick Bloom okay not Quicken not just
[02:04:42] like aggravate but you add hyper Bloom
[02:04:45] okay when I was playing Just Soo
[02:04:47] aggravate I was not having fun it's not
[02:04:49] bad I just was not having fun and the
[02:04:51] the longer Soo was out for the more I
[02:04:53] was like you know what I like hyper blo
[02:04:55] a lot even if you lose some aggravates
[02:04:57] on Soo you're making up for it so I
[02:05:00] usually recommend either like finina or
[02:05:02] yolan or SRO in that team and then
[02:05:04] you're just chilling because you
[02:05:05] actually make use of sinos Kit a lot
[02:05:07] better and I like thundering Fury over
[02:05:10] gilded um but if that still doesn't work
[02:05:12] consider changing
[02:05:16] teams he SP two years on field yeah but
[02:05:19] that's what Soo does right no one's
[02:05:20] playing Soo to Quick swap like if you're
[02:05:22] playing quick swap go kaching or just
[02:05:24] bench like literally don't swap into
[02:05:25] sign like if you're just playing [ __ ]
[02:05:27] quick swap play Nita Singo cuki and then
[02:05:29] don't swap to your fourth
[02:05:35] character he said it l w okay I didn't
[02:05:39] say Ben Soo I just said don't quick swap
[02:05:41] him
[02:05:53] yeah exactly rapid flash I I don't know
[02:05:56] like I don't think it's exact like I I'm
[02:06:00] pretty sure depending on your supports
[02:06:01] you do lose out like if you have too
[02:06:03] much Hydro op you can lose out on some
[02:06:04] aggravates I don't think it's like
[02:06:06] exactly the same hit of his personal
[02:06:08] damage but it doesn't matter cuz you do
[02:06:10] way more uh yeah and you lose out on VV
[02:06:13] but you you get way more hyper Bloom
[02:06:14] damage so it doesn't matter if you're
[02:06:16] losing a little bit
[02:06:24] uh I need more em on my Hut uh that's
[02:06:26] the only thing I'm worried about right
[02:06:27] now I guess my goblets wrong yeah that's
[02:06:29] why whoopsie daisies sorry dude
[02:06:33] [Applause]
[02:06:35] I you ever say something and then you're
[02:06:37] like why do I even speak at all this is
[02:06:40] not bad it's only 110m but like it's not
[02:06:41] even bad we have HP sounds it's pretty
[02:06:45] good oh I'm not on
[02:06:50] VV oh what
[02:06:53] yeah I just swirled
[02:06:57] nothing yo what am I
[02:07:01] doing I don't even know yeah my team

[02:08:01] at it I don't know okay we'll see when
[02:08:03] she's out I don't know but it is I have
[02:08:08] faith that she's going to be good
[02:08:09] because of how hype she is however I
[02:08:12] don't know if new pyro DPS being like
[02:08:18] historically we haven't gotten a pyro
[02:08:20] DPS or a pyro character released better
[02:08:24] than changling does that mean it's not
[02:08:26] going to happen I'm not saying that I'm
[02:08:29] not saying that I'm just saying don't
[02:08:31] immediately expect has to be better than
[02:08:33] off field pyro
[02:08:37] okay Linny is right there
[02:08:45] [Music]
[02:08:55] anyways Linny is cool though I like
[02:08:57] Linny no disrespect to Linny he's pretty
[02:09:00] good like I think lenn's actually pretty
[02:09:02] good you play him like model pyro you
[02:09:04] could run like uh Bennett you can run
[02:09:06] kazua you can run J Lee de's fine not as
[02:09:09] good as J Lee but she's fine there um
[02:09:11] you
[02:09:13] know I've heard there's some new finina
[02:09:15] Lin Tech which uh I I I should try out
[02:09:20] there's a lot of like weird new fin
[02:09:21] teams that I'm like not up to date on I
[02:09:23] should we should do a stream in Abyss
[02:09:24] where we just play a bunch of random
[02:09:25] [ __ ] with
[02:09:28] finina
[02:09:32] rting let the
[02:09:35] world the how do you know she's onfield
[02:09:38] Suk I've talked about this before even
[02:09:41] before any of the the the the the the
[02:09:43] our forefathers were with us dude it
[02:09:46] like it literally there's characters
[02:09:50] that don't look like reports like I
[02:09:52] don't know what to tell you man there
[02:09:53] characters you see them and you're like
[02:09:56] oh my you are going to be a DPS I don't
[02:09:59] know she could be a support I don't
[02:10:03] know to be fair DEA does look like a DPS
[02:10:07] but her burst is designed I don't think
[02:10:09] DEA was designed to be a I don't know
[02:10:12] actually but I feel like dea like they
[02:10:14] intended for her to be people to be like
[02:10:17] oh yes I can use her on field and punch
[02:10:19] things and then also be a support master
[02:10:21] of all
[02:10:23] trades I don't think she was designed
[02:10:26] okay
[02:10:27] [Music]

[02:11:31] it's me like big Z and that's basically
[02:11:33] it you could argue like zff as the third

[02:19:36] yeah are you doing viewer pulls for
[02:19:38] arino oh I forgot about that but I
[02:19:41] really think I should I think it's good
[02:19:42] content I think you guys want it I think
[02:19:45] I guys want it so we probably will the
[02:19:48] problem is though is that like I don't
[02:19:51] know if when I want to do them because
[02:19:53] naturally if you guys want arino you
[02:19:55] want to do it day one but like I feel
[02:19:57] like the first thing I want to do with
[02:19:58] arino is like test her out like make
[02:19:59] sure she's good or like you know but I
[02:20:01] could do like an hour of pulls and then
[02:20:04] test like I could do like pulling for
[02:20:05] like an hour or two and then test or I
[02:20:08] could do testing first and then pulls a
[02:20:10] bit later I I don't
[02:20:11] know I mean what do you guys think is
[02:20:14] better cuz I don't know like what do
[02:20:16] other streamers do well I guess other
[02:20:18] streamers don't have to test the
[02:20:19] character or like if they do they're not
[02:20:21] like also pulling I don't know I don't
[02:20:22] [ __ ] know here comes the
[02:20:27] catch
[02:20:29] consequen you pulls day two yeah but
[02:20:32] what if you want her
[02:20:38] now time to go I just aled a pyro slime
[02:20:41] poggers busted are about to get y
[02:20:59] I mean we could also do like two hours
[02:21:01] of pulls at the start or I could just do
[02:21:04] the pulls a bit
[02:21:15] later learn how to play the team dude

[03:01:34] worthless I've been wondering this for a
[03:01:37] long time what is an ICD like I said
[03:01:40] don't know what it
[03:01:42] is ICD
[03:01:46] [Music]
[03:01:52] I through with
[03:02:00] my okay let
[03:02:04] me one second let me stop
[03:02:09] plunging someone asked what is ICD let
[03:02:11] me give you a simple explanation of what
[03:02:13] is ICD ICD stands for internal cool down
[03:02:16] you might be like oh what is that I I
[03:02:17] don't understand okay let me let me
[03:02:18] simplify this for you ICD is like if you
[03:02:22] drop food on the ground and there's like
[03:02:24] a 3 second rule right what is the 3
[03:02:26] second rule why does it exist well
[03:02:28] because there's a 3 seconds in dirt
[03:02:30] application but like a cool down before
[03:02:32] it can apply dirt again so why does a 3C
[03:02:34] rule exist because you drop it on the
[03:02:36] ground there's dirt immediately there's
[03:02:37] a little bit so it's immediately a bit
[03:02:38] dirty but if you pick it up right away
[03:02:40] it's going to be uh quote unquote safer
[03:02:43] than if you wait a little bit because in
[03:02:44] a little bit more dirt will be applied
[03:02:47] onto it that that is internal cool down
[03:02:48] so in game what that translates to is
[03:02:50] let's say uh you have a character who
[03:02:52] applies Hydro right they apply Hydro
[03:02:54] really fast okay every hit hydro hydro
[03:02:56] hydro well not every hit is actually
[03:02:59] going to put Hydro on the enemy because
[03:03:01] of something called internal cool down
[03:03:03] okay depending on like it's variable per
[03:03:04] ability and per character so Shang Ling
[03:03:07] for example why is Shang Ling so good
[03:03:09] well many reasons and one of the reasons
[03:03:11] is that her burst has no internal cool
[03:03:14] down on pyro application okay so every
[03:03:16] time her Pyon NATO
[03:03:19] hits an enemy it will apply pyro
[03:03:21] vaporize melt uh whatever it is right uh
[03:03:24] that is
[03:03:27] ICD bacteria waits for the internal cool
[03:03:29] down yes bacteria is very respectful of
[03:03:31] the genin rules that also exist in real
[03:03:35] life you're welcome for the ICD
[03:03:40] explanation you're
[03:03:43] welcome okay
[03:03:50] never become a
[03:03:51] teacher can you watch
[03:03:55] this this is a video called he did what
[03:03:58] to a fish I really don't want to click

[03:07:29] [Music]
[03:07:44] [Music]
[03:07:53] please thought before you Duality what
[03:07:55] do you mean by
[03:07:56] that what is this song kill hauled by a
[03:08:00] storm dude I have to pee so bad I don't
[03:08:03] want
[03:08:04] to are you know Nan's going to be [ __ ]
[03:08:07] really I mean it might that actually
[03:08:08] might but I usually have High Hopes
[03:08:12] because I I thought font 10 would be
[03:08:14] [ __ ] cuz of underwater and I'm like
[03:08:16] underwater like I can't fathom enjoying
[03:08:18] that but I don't know about you but I'm
[03:08:21] feeling
[03:08:23] 22 but I'm actually enjoying fent so I
[03:08:27] uh yeah I think to be honest though
[03:08:32] like I
[03:08:34] like
[03:08:38] sumaru um probably the most outside of
[03:08:42] the desert
[03:08:43] but uh but font's been really fun um
[03:08:50] however I think shz NAA and everything
[03:08:54] after is going to be like turbo Peak
[03:08:57] like that's my guess I don't know about
[03:08:59] nland it could be either way it could be
[03:09:00] [ __ ] amazing or could be [ __ ]
[03:09:02] terrible uh we'll
[03:09:04] see I think it could actually be
[03:09:06] anything like they could make the
[03:09:07] [ __ ] archon a like pyro toddler that
[03:09:10] no one likes and be like wow I'm a
[03:09:11] [ __ ] kid but I'm 7 million years old
[03:09:14] why and then I'm going to [ __ ] hate
[03:09:15] her or it could be something cool like I
[03:09:17] don't know but we'll see
[03:09:20] um you know but capitano's there
[03:09:23] apparently so according to nevet not a
[03:09:26] leak uh maybe dor whips it out who knows
[03:09:29] uh but so we'll
[03:09:37] see do you hate Nita no but I hated the
[03:09:40] fact that they like I don't know like I
[03:09:43] hated the idea of Nita but like I did
[03:09:45] the quest and now I really like her I
[03:09:46] think she's cool
[03:09:48] I just like like when I look at Nita and
[03:09:50] then I look at like okay I'm sorry for
[03:09:52] saying her name but greater Lord Ruka
[03:09:54] Dada I'm like oh [ __ ] that should have
[03:09:55] been the
[03:09:59] archon who [ __ ] my bad I'm sorry sorry
[03:10:04] sorry sorry
[03:10:07] sorry oh [ __ ] Cole I'm
[03:10:10] sorry if cabano isn't play dude
[03:10:13] but that's why AR Lino is is so
[03:10:17] important it's not just because she's
[03:10:18] arino like yes she's arino woof woof
[03:10:21] bark but also because it shows that okay
[03:10:24] [ __ ] maybe more fouille harbingers are
[03:10:26] going to be playable yeah we have [ __ ]
[03:10:27] ass tartaglia yeah we have [ __ ]

[03:10:51] so like hopefully that means more
[03:10:54] fou dude I hope they give us the
[03:10:57] characters when they're like morally
[03:10:58] gray and then they turn out to be like
[03:11:00] turbo

[03:12:15] terrible okay no space
[03:12:20] of course you defend an assassin dude
[03:12:22] assassins in like every game and show
[03:12:25] are cool I don't care like you
[03:12:30] know ideally they don't assassinate my
[03:12:37] friends dude the [ __ ] uh what's his
[03:12:39] name the zalic family and Hunter Hunter
[03:12:42] [ __ ] sick they're
[03:12:45] assassins uh what am I looking for oh
[03:13:01] artifacts what if arino kills Shia bro
[03:13:04] why the [ __ ] would she even meet
[03:13:08] Shia also Shia would solo her I'm sorry
[03:13:11] she would actually solo her I don't I
[03:13:13] actually don't care he actually would
[03:13:27] um and this is coming from someone who
[03:13:29] would be fine if Shia died by the way I
[03:13:31] don't think it's I think like Shia like
[03:13:34] okay recently he's been like smiling
[03:13:35] more like wow Lantern right wow I love
[03:13:37] you but like cool but like I think like
[03:13:40] Shia like L like I feel like it's not
[03:13:42] even bad for a storyline to die because
[03:13:44] he's like okay suffering I've been
[03:13:45] through so much all my [ __ ] Clan
[03:13:47] yakas like they're dead but like I don't
[03:13:49] think it's bad for him to die it just it
[03:13:51] would need a reason like it has to like
[03:13:52] be
[03:13:57] impactful but I think at this point it's
[03:13:59] going from like yeah like they're trying
[03:14:02] to make him happy like they went from
[03:14:03] like I I'm suffering forever to like I'm
[03:14:06] still suffering forever but like I'm
[03:14:07] kind of smiling like I'm kind of
[03:14:08] enjoying life like you know I like you
[03:14:09] traveler a little bit why would why
[03:14:12] should he suffer and then die no but
[03:14:15] like the point okay you asked me three
[03:14:17] years ago and it's like or two years ago
[03:14:19] and it's like okay Shia seems to just
[03:14:21] like be suffering all the time so like I
[03:14:24] feel like if he like sacrifices himself
[03:14:26] for the greater good it would like make
[03:14:27] sense for the storyline like literally
[03:14:29] in the Aron Quest where Jean Le saved
[03:14:30] his ass it it made sense for jangi to
[03:14:32] save him cuz like if not where the [ __ ]
[03:14:34] were you but also it's like he was just
[03:14:36] trying to sacrifice himself for the team
[03:14:37] he was like [ __ ] it and he like saved us
[03:14:39] all and then anyways spoilers it's been
[03:14:43] two years but okay my bad I'll shut up
[03:14:50] normalize seeking help I thought you
[03:14:52] talking about me if you're talking to
[03:14:53] Shia yeah well okay who can help Shia I
[03:14:55] mean us traveler well not traveler but
[03:14:57] like
[03:14:59] me venty sh Jong Le be like hey what's
[03:15:04] up
[03:15:12] Dad let the world C
[03:15:17] Cloud
[03:15:19] conver Zer this is 20 months appreciate
[03:15:21] it how you
[03:15:23] been
[03:15:27] hey if Jang Le could save Shia couldn't
[03:15:30] he save
[03:15:32] bious okay but like here's my take if
[03:15:35] bious were alive we wouldn't have
[03:15:36] Vermilion so like was it even worth him
[03:15:39] like
[03:15:43] like okay no B is a Chad though
[03:15:50] dude imag the world wouldn't be ready
[03:15:51] for playable bous chat look at this

[03:16:15] imagine mid he's actually kind of
[03:16:21] big yeah he looks like
[03:16:26] Machamp but that's cool I I like to have
[03:16:29] a different character model that'd be
[03:16:30] cool

[03:29:34] are you talking
[03:29:36] to Pizza Pizza is so bad dude it is
[03:29:39] sometimes it's the only thing open at
[03:29:40] like 3:00 a.m. and I'll just order a
[03:29:41] large pepperoni it kind of hits but like
[03:29:44] everything else is whack
[03:29:47] I don't even know how Pizza Pizza is
[03:29:48] still in business business they're so
[03:29:51] [ __ ] whatever they're they're like
[03:29:53] they're extra pepperoni is like fine
[03:29:55] like just only pepperoni is fine you
[03:29:57] order anything else you
[03:30:01] evaporate but like their their crust is
[03:30:03] like
[03:30:06] cardboard garlic sauce sles okay I
[03:30:08] haven't tried that
[03:30:10] maybe dude I okay I I love Popeyes like
[03:30:14] I I [ __ ] love Popeyes like spicy it's
[03:30:17] like it actually clears KFC it's not
[03:30:18] even close but KFC gaming if you want to
[03:30:20] sponsor me hey I'll change my mind but
[03:30:22] uh I do love poiz but I usually get
[03:30:24] black and ranch but like last time it
[03:30:27] [ __ ] killed me like it literally
[03:30:28] killed my entire body and then the
[03:30:30] dumbass that I am is I ate more and then
[03:30:32] it killed me again cuz I was like maybe
[03:30:34] it was like an AC and then it killed me
[03:30:35] again and then I was like okay I think
[03:30:38] it's just the sauce and then I ate the
[03:30:39] chicken without the sauce and I was fine
[03:30:41] so I'm pretty sure their black and Ranch
[03:30:42] was just like they left it out or some
[03:30:45] [ __ ] I don't know so now I I don't
[03:30:52] know Ma b s
[03:30:59] months I try to order the like Sor word
[03:31:01] out of chicken wait do they do that what
[03:31:03] does why don't you close if you're a
[03:31:05] chicken place and you're out of chicken
[03:31:07] bro you have one
[03:31:10] job imagine you spend resin and they're
[03:31:13] like oh no artifacts we're out and then
[03:31:16] you get eeko instead of Vermilion maybe
[03:31:17] that's what's happening maybe that's a
[03:31:19] good metaphor for
[03:31:21] Life Burger King burgers slap paid
[03:31:25] Chatters the Jeff replied true we have
[03:31:28] [ __ ] the Burger King in chat yeah no
[03:31:31] one said that ever okay I will say I the
[03:31:34] only thing I like about like the Whopper
[03:31:35] is that there's a lot of meat like I
[03:31:37] like that it's big but yeah it's Burger
[03:31:39] King is so mid dude it's not even mid
[03:31:41] it's so like H I don't know it's not
[03:31:44] great
[03:31:51] are you hearing yourself no but like
[03:31:53] like my dad likes it but like okay you
[03:31:56] would like a lot of meat for the price
[03:31:58] like you don't want to like well I don't
[03:32:00] okay it's been a while since I've been
[03:32:01] there so I don't even know if it's good
[03:32:02] value but I'm saying you'd like to if
[03:32:05] you're ordering a hamburger you would
[03:32:08] like there to be a lot of meat like okay
[03:32:10] let's say you're buying like like when
[03:32:13] places are trying to scam you they'll
[03:32:14] give you like a lot of like carbs and
[03:32:15] low protein or like like if you order
[03:32:18] like a drink they'll give you like a
[03:32:19] shot of like a little bit of alcohol and
[03:32:20] then a bunch of like other [ __ ] that's
[03:32:22] cheap that's how they scam you okay but
[03:32:24] if you get like a lot of meat you're
[03:32:25] like whoa I wasn't expecting this much
[03:32:27] meat and then it's it's like okay the
[03:32:29] expectations are higher cuz there's more
[03:32:31] meat and sometimes you don't need that
[03:32:32] much meat but having more meat sets
[03:32:34] higher expectations even if you don't
[03:32:36] end up using all the okay dude but like
[03:32:39] in this context yeah Burger King's not
[03:32:41] great and I'm not a big fan but you know
[03:32:44] at least the burgers
[03:32:49] big please stop saying meat okay dude I
[03:32:53] I what do you want me to say
[03:32:58] Patty okay yo unmod the person that said

[05:41:55] so I am more credible here yo can
[05:41:57] someone unban me I I don't I don't think

[05:42:11] tried to unban you it didn't work oh my
[05:42:13] God I saw that vid too wait I've been
[05:42:15] saying this for years I didn't know
[05:42:16] there's actually a video is there Genji
[05:42:19] I'm not looking that up never
[05:42:23] mind he was not in war okay well dude it
[05:42:26] doesn't matter he's a cyborg okay you
[05:42:27] can modify stuff
[05:42:37] I mean everyone's only one decision away
[05:42:40] from being a cyborg you know okay what
[05:42:42] are you doing so wait are you promoting
[05:42:45] cyborg ISM all I'm saying is if you want
[05:42:48] to
[05:42:53] VI talking about Boot Hill y booty
[05:42:59] Hill yo is he not just okay yo I only
[05:43:02] saw the D marketing but was that not
[05:43:04] just like
[05:43:05] arino but like Rob he has the color
[05:43:09] scheme there's you know there's like red
[05:43:13] there's black know there's some gray
[05:43:15] some white shades of white is there
[05:43:17] shades of white shade
[05:43:19] Shades there's you know they got the
[05:43:21] long hair going on do you think there
[05:43:24] would be drama if uh arino came out like
[05:43:26] if if let's say booill came out like
[05:43:28] okay let's say booill came out and genin
[05:43:30] two years ago and then arlino comes out
[05:43:32] in Star rail today do you think there'
[05:43:34] be
[05:43:34] drama wait vice versa sorry arino went
[05:43:37] out in Star Rail and then Bo Hill comes
[05:43:39] out in genin you think people be like oh
[05:43:41] [ __ ] you know they copied us B
[05:43:44] man do can I link you a 2hour video
[05:43:47] about yeah
[05:43:49] how about how wait let me make sure this
[05:43:53] share link has a [ __ ] time stamp in
[05:43:54] it because it's YouTube
[05:43:58] sucks about how we actually are cyborgs
[05:44:03] I'm not watching that that guy has too
[05:44:05] much time on his hands any relation
[05:44:08] think about how much free time you need
[05:44:09] to make a 2our dissertation on that
[05:44:11] think about it it's not just on that
[05:44:13] it's on B Burnham and Jeff Bezos okay
[05:44:15] I'm not dude what are you doing it's a
[05:44:18] banger video I'm not watching that to be
[05:44:21] fair I'm intrigued to see why it is two
[05:44:24] hours I I'll send it in the group chat
[05:44:26] it's a it's a banger
[05:44:29] video yeah I mean hey that arino stream
[05:44:32] ain't for another couple hours you know
[05:44:34] I was SLE conspiracy theorist it's not a
[05:44:37] conspiracy theory it's it's an
[05:44:41] argument that that is about the
[05:44:43] definition of being a cyborg it's not
[05:44:45] saying like hey you have a machine in
[05:44:47] your
[05:44:48] brain wait so it's just like the the
[05:44:51] idea yeah I got have a machine in me or
[05:44:54] we're not meaningfully like our our
[05:44:56] Reliance on phones isn't meaningfully
[05:44:58] different
[05:45:00] than relying on an additional sense CL
[05:45:04] confir uh or or or intera oh I see I see
[05:45:08] what you're saying now I see what you're
[05:45:09] saying we're just like so engulfed by
[05:45:11] technology that we basically like run on
[05:45:14] it yeah and it's all like it's not an
[05:45:16] inherently negative thing it it's it's a
[05:45:19] very good
[05:45:22] video no that's that's that's I'd watch
[05:45:26] that would I watch it now probably not
[05:45:29] but I would watch
[05:45:32] it link it you ever done like a 2hour
[05:45:36] react Nick
[05:45:38] no have you I did um I don't want to
[05:45:41] react to this but I did
[05:45:44] um dude it seems I don't know yeah I
[05:45:47] reacted to hoo Fair no I I reacted to
[05:45:51] there's definitely some long videos I've
[05:45:52] reacted to I just can't remember
[05:45:54] what oh yeah the aot gen's first impact
[05:45:57] was like an hour and a half oh that one
[05:45:59] is that's actually like one of the best
[05:46:02] wellmade videos that's good oh also
[05:46:04] Max's video was pretty long but I don't
[05:46:05] think it was that long dude I never
[05:46:07] watch it because I keep thinking man I I
[05:46:09] don't want to watch this off stream and
[05:46:11] then I keep thinking man I don't want to
[05:46:12] be like react anding to a video I don't
[05:46:16] have much to add on you know that's
[05:46:18] Duality bro that's like you know what
[05:46:21] that is that's like a paradox that's
[05:46:23] shro dinger's video yeah that's like
[05:46:26] shro dinger's video you've both watched
[05:46:28] it and not watched it you can't react to
[05:46:31] it you can't watch it offline but you
[05:46:34] can do both as well also Z yeah keep
[05:46:38] going sorry sorry no I have nothing
[05:46:41] value to add to no I was just saying I
[05:46:43] thought about this dude okay tell me if
[05:46:46] I'm wrong dude [ __ ] me if I'm wrong but
[05:46:48] I swear I'm good I'm not going to be
[05:46:51] wrong don't worry I I swear
[05:46:54] like react content a lot of times people
[05:46:57] just want someone to be there watching
[05:46:59] it with them even if they don't say
[05:47:00] anything and a lot of times if they
[05:47:02] pause or say something it's like they're
[05:47:04] like why are you pausing like stop like
[05:47:05] I just want to watch the video but like
[05:47:06] they want you to be like I watched no
[05:47:09] that's so true yeah and like sometimes
[05:47:10] during like the genin live or like other
[05:47:12] lives it's like I feel like if I'm
[05:47:13] talking people get mad at me I'm dude
[05:47:16] it's crazy I'm going be real with you I
[05:47:19] don't really give a
[05:47:21] [ __ ] no but it is content
[05:47:25] creation like
[05:47:27] like yeah some people just want someone
[05:47:30] to curate their content for them but
[05:47:32] like you're not really doing something
[05:47:35] transformative and if that's what you're
[05:47:37] doing you should be paying the people
[05:47:39] whose videos you're watching okay but
[05:47:40] like you're like that's not what I'm
[05:47:42] saying though it's not like okay I agree
[05:47:45] that like reacts to and then you steal
[05:47:48] their thumbnail and you if you just
[05:47:51] watching the whole ass
[05:47:53] video well okay I think the people who
[05:47:55] made the video I think if it's a stream
[05:47:57] versus if it's a video it's a different
[05:47:58] thing to be fair I think streaming is
[05:47:59] like kind of whatever but yeah if you're
[05:48:02] just like yoing it and then reuploading
[05:48:04] it sure but like I'm saying let's say
[05:48:06] you're watching like something live
[05:48:08] people just want to watch it with
[05:48:11] you no I mean you guys are both right
[05:48:14] it's like it's h it's it's it's like
[05:48:18] value it's just value if someone find
[05:48:21] Value in it it's still technically
[05:48:24] content if someone finds value in
[05:48:27] watching you watch something else
[05:48:29] there's value in that cuz they I mean i'
[05:48:32] find Value in watching someone watch a
[05:48:33] [ __ ] movie but that yeah it it's
[05:48:36] different if movie on stream legal yeah
[05:48:38] if you're just yoing if you're just like
[05:48:40] stealing content and then just like
[05:48:41] blasting it you don't say anything
[05:48:42] that's that's one thing but yeah but if
[05:48:44] you're like adding to it like I don't I
[05:48:47] don't think you can be quiet the whole
[05:48:48] time but especially with like live stuff
[05:48:50] like I I would rather [ __ ] die than
[05:48:53] watch the official valerant Liv stream
[05:48:54] but I'll watch trick watch it even if he
[05:48:56] says like two words like it's a big for
[05:48:59] me it's like a big difference even if he
[05:49:01] doesn't like constantly say stuff but
[05:49:03] that's different than just like yoing
[05:49:05] someone's like video essay and just like
[05:49:06] like reuploading it you know like I
[05:49:08] watch this it's just your chair or like
[05:49:09] you're eating it's a different thing
[05:49:11] between like watching an actual like
[05:49:14] live stream that's meant to be a [ __ ]
[05:49:16] ad for the game and where like they
[05:49:18] actually actively want you to restream
[05:49:22] it and [ __ ] watching someone else's
[05:49:25] video ESS say like they're they're
[05:49:27] definitely two different
[05:49:28] conversations yeah I I'm of team it's
[05:49:32] okay to watch stuff if uh unless it's
[05:49:34] explicitly not wanted by the Creator if
[05:49:36] you're like properly crediting and
[05:49:38] talking like if you're adding stuff but
[05:49:40] I just don't like to like yo re-upload
[05:49:42] change like put your face in the
[05:49:43] thumbnail cuz Okay if you re-upload
[05:49:45] you're yoinking all the views but if
[05:49:47] you're like watching on stream and you
[05:49:48] like link it and you support the like I
[05:49:50] would like people to watch my videos
[05:49:52] because I've seen growth every time
[05:49:53] people have personally my experience
[05:49:55] every time people talk about me or watch
[05:49:57] my videos or watch my Clips I'm like hey
[05:49:59] people are learning about me that's my
[05:50:00] take is that everyone's take no but like
[05:50:02] that's what I've found so I like it but
[05:50:05] I don't do to other people that don't
[05:50:07] like it like I don't care like I'm
[05:50:10] not you're assuming that the other
[05:50:12] person is okay with it until they tell
[05:50:14] you you're not which is kind of like a
[05:50:16] [ __ ] up thing to do I mean you should
[05:50:19] ask beforeand if you want to do that you
[05:50:21] should ask the people beforehand you
[05:50:23] shouldn't just assume oh no it's their
[05:50:26] job to tell me not to do this shitty
[05:50:28] thing to them okay yes absolutely if
[05:50:31] you're Ying the content but like let's
[05:50:33] say you upload a YouTube video I'm not
[05:50:35] going to be like no one can watch this
[05:50:38] like I think if you like you should
[05:50:40] credit and stuff but it shouldn't be
[05:50:42] like about watching it's about streaming
[05:50:44] It 2 thousands of people that's a
[05:50:47] different thing you're not just watching
[05:50:49] you're actively profiting off of the
[05:50:51] video often making more money than the
[05:50:53] video itself makes yeah that's if you're
[05:50:56] Ying
[05:50:59] it what do you mean that's you're y I
[05:51:02] think I think it's definitely a very uh
[05:51:04] new sort of like way to consume and
[05:51:07] create content cuz there's no like again
[05:51:09] it's the internet right there's no like
[05:51:12] rule there's no law but there there are
[05:51:15] things we can do to like healthily
[05:51:19] communicate what is okay between one
[05:51:21] another and unfortunately or fortunately
[05:51:25] it's different from person to person
[05:51:26] because there is no law no no one can
[05:51:28] follow one ultimate rule because of it
[05:51:31] so it's like it it is just like a the
[05:51:33] base concept of it for both of you guys
[05:51:35] right now is that
[05:51:37] it's a level of
[05:51:38] communication like Have you communicated
[05:51:41] how you feel about something or vice
[05:51:43] versa yeah I've always fundamentally
[05:51:46] like dis like this take I've always like
[05:51:49] built in me is like I've seen myself and
[05:51:52] a lot of my friends grow just through
[05:51:53] other people watching them and talking
[05:51:55] about them but like I get you know it's
[05:51:57] different than like big streamer takes
[05:51:59] your video Ys everything reuploads it
[05:52:01] like that's different but like I think
[05:52:04] that a lot of people grow from other
[05:52:06] people people talking about them or
[05:52:07] watching their stuff and be like oh this
[05:52:08] guy's cool like like that's how I found
[05:52:10] out a lot of people that I watch so like
[05:52:13] I don't like um yeah I don't know I gu I
[05:52:16] I guess a good analogy is like art on
[05:52:18] Twitter you know some artists are like
[05:52:20] no reposts well yeah but that's yeah but
[05:52:22] like yeah that's that's a bit different
[05:52:24] I feel although I guess you could argue
[05:52:26] someone could do the same thing with a
[05:52:27] video like do not like I mean we've seen
[05:52:30] [ __ ] me how you do it don't react to
[05:52:32] this but like obviously it doesn't
[05:52:33] always work like that but if it's a form
[05:52:35] of art from like not a company but
[05:52:37] someone individual like there's
[05:52:39] definitely a higher level of like demand
[05:52:41] for respect cuz like that's a single
[05:52:43] person's wish and if like you don't like
[05:52:45] follow that it's dis essentially I don't
[05:52:48] know I mean I agree with that but yeah I
[05:52:51] mean it's just about like stating it not
[05:52:53] everyone States their boundaries
[05:52:55] immediately on the internet that that's
[05:52:57] the issue yeah I think it's just it's
[05:53:00] cringe to expect people who don't want
[05:53:04] it that oh no if you oh
[05:53:06] never told me well I guess that means I
[05:53:09] can do
[05:53:11] it you are doing the thing they you
[05:53:13] can't expect anyone who makes a thing to
[05:53:16] go out of their way to tell everyone in
[05:53:18] the [ __ ] world
[05:53:21] hey don't repost my things you know like
[05:53:25] just if you actually want to build your
[05:53:29] [ __ ] Channel around reacting to [ __ ]
[05:53:32] just ask the people you're reacting to
[05:53:34] before you do if that's what your
[05:53:36] channel is about that's what you should
[05:53:38] do yeah I mean that's the I think that's
[05:53:41] like the morally correct take but I also
[05:53:42] think on the internet the default is
[05:53:44] always going to be internet I can react
[05:53:45] to this unless they're like hey please
[05:53:47] don't react to this or credit like most
[05:53:49] people like credit if you're like like
[05:53:50] reacting to my video or some [ __ ] like I
[05:53:52] don't think the default on the internet
[05:53:54] will be ask every YouTube video I watch
[05:53:55] on stream You can disagree I don't like
[05:53:57] that's F I'm not here to I don't care
[05:53:59] personally I don't care either way like
[05:54:00] you know I'm not making video like I
[05:54:02] don't care if anyone reacts to my stuff
[05:54:04] that's fine but like I think the default
[05:54:06] on the internet's always going to be
[05:54:08] people will watch my stuff and like
[05:54:10] unless it's like specified hey please
[05:54:12] don't or please credit or please
[05:54:13] whatever like that's what I think the
[05:54:15] default is going to be should that be
[05:54:16] the default Maybe not maybe yes
[05:54:19] conversation here that's not yeah but
[05:54:21] I'm not here to like argue about that
[05:54:22] cuz I think I think the default is never
[05:54:24] going to be that and then like cuz
[05:54:26] you're going to say yes it should be
[05:54:27] that I'm going to say no and then it's
[05:54:28] going to be like a 10 hour then we don't
[05:54:30] disagree if if
[05:54:33] like yeah obviously people are shitty
[05:54:37] we agreement there I think like I think
[05:54:40] it wouldn't like I think if the default
[05:54:42] is ask it's going to like I don't know
[05:54:44] how to explain this like it's not going
[05:54:46] to like it I cannot even think of it as
[05:54:48] feasible cuz like big streamers are just
[05:54:50] like the bigger streamers are just going
[05:54:52] to be the people that are just being
[05:54:54] unethical so I think that's what it is
[05:54:57] right now no your your reasoning makes
[05:54:59] sense because you've come from the
[05:55:01] positive outcome of that
[05:55:04] concept so if if someone on the other
[05:55:07] side were to talk about this obviously
[05:55:09] they wouldn't have the same like you
[05:55:12] know take basically which is where like
[05:55:14] you you can only benefit off it at the
[05:55:16] end of the day right yeah so it's like
[05:55:19] yeah it it all just comes down to
[05:55:24] just there's really no rules on the
[05:55:27] Internet it's all just like is that a
[05:55:29] [ __ ] hydrus yeah dude it's all just
[05:55:32] it's it's all just such new wants rules
[05:55:37] that people have to
[05:55:39] communicate that's that's really it
[05:55:42] that's really
[05:55:44] it I I'd communicate with
[05:55:49] you I appreciate
[05:55:52] that
[05:55:54] anyways sh by the way it is not that
[05:55:57] deep like this is not yeah we're not mad
[05:56:00] just this is how we talk this is normal
[05:56:02] but yeah like you know like my role mod
[05:56:04] like when I see people that I look up to
[05:56:06] like
[05:56:06] like Mr Beast will say stuff like yeah
[05:56:08] watch my stuff like cuz like that's how
[05:56:09] he grows and like but I you know like I
[05:56:13] if I saw this one YouTuber makes like a
[05:56:15] one year like a video a year and it's
[05:56:16] like super high quality and then like 10
[05:56:18] people react to it reupload it yoink the
[05:56:20] thumbnail put their face next to it they
[05:56:21] get more views it's like yeah like I
[05:56:24] think there's a line that's all that's
[05:56:26] just my like
[05:56:28] conclusion yeah there's definitely a
[05:56:30] line but it's like the thing
[05:56:32] is no one can enforce it like no one's
[05:56:35] going to
[05:56:37] yeah it's not about enforcing it it's
[05:56:39] more so like yeah if people are being
[05:56:43] shitty about it I'm going to think less
[05:56:45] of them yeah I mean that's fair
[05:56:48] that's I mean yeah I mean if someone's
[05:56:51] shitty definitely right there like
[05:56:53] there's only so much you can do
[05:56:56] basically yeah but yeah I'm always just
[05:56:59] like
[05:57:02] you yeah
[05:57:07] yeah who's in the call besides Z Tanto
[05:57:10] go check him out yeah so golf with
[05:57:13] friends is actually free on Steam I'm
[05:57:15] pretty sure
[05:57:16] bro yo get on valer I'm I'm actually
[05:57:19] warmed up I played a comp I
[05:57:21] one okay I I'm down to play you just
[05:57:24] been running around with [ __ ]
[05:57:27] s this is the state of gen
[05:57:31] impact you know star has like a
[05:57:33] bartending event right now you know
[05:57:35] genin has like cat petting
[05:57:37] event neither of those are very
[05:57:44] good remember that clip of holy [ __ ]
[05:57:47] fine Fortress and test run that's crazy
[05:57:51] to
[05:57:53] see a video essay on why genin is dying
[05:57:55] and it's not okay a
[05:57:59] thumbnail remember that of you drowning
[05:58:01] in maybe that yeah what the [ __ ]
[05:58:03] happened okay unironically like I manag
[05:58:06] to recreate it it is really difficult
[05:58:09] how did you manage to do this by
[05:58:10] accident yeah I think you like run out
[05:58:12] of stamina like mid jump and they think
[05:58:14] you're like not plunging or some [ __ ]
[05:58:16] not diving so you have to be in both
[05:58:19] completely out of s like actually zero
[05:58:22] stamina while you're jumping and do the
[05:58:24] dive
[05:58:25] animation natural Talent baby like it's
[05:58:29] act there's not that many places on the
[05:58:31] map where that can happen dude I'm
[05:58:33] actually different you know many times I
[05:58:34] drown in [ __ ] Le fountain
[05:58:38] that's not something to brag about
[05:58:41] okay wait Jake do you know this about my
[05:58:43] do you know about my yashiori
[05:58:46] Island do I do I want to
[05:58:49] know no no no no listen listen Jake do
[05:58:51] you know about my yashiori Island you
[05:58:53] have that [ __ ] 100% holy 100% no no look
[05:58:56] at this look at this this domain is not
[05:58:57] unlocked and look at what happens if I
[05:58:59] teleport here watch this watch this
[05:59:01] watch this watch this watch this watch
[05:59:02] this let me cook let me cook let me cook
[05:59:06] the lightning is still intact and
[05:59:08] there's an andr Ulus above my head where
[05:59:10] is it right
[05:59:14] there wa how does that even work I don't
[05:59:16] know I think I'm at like the the M like
[05:59:18] the lowest threshold for 100 but I got
[05:59:20] it and I didn't stop the lightning and I
[05:59:21] never will y m main forever baby I'm
[05:59:23] vaping every [ __ ]
[05:59:26] shot wait that's like a region buff yeah
[05:59:29] is that
[05:59:31] though it is I mean imagine once we get
[05:59:34] a self infus like going to get wait
[05:59:37] that's a good D
[05:59:39] buff wait no it is that's why I said
[05:59:43] Yia actually op wait Z do you think
[05:59:45] you're a theory crafter right do you
[05:59:47] think there's internal cool down in real
[05:59:48] life which is why the 3 second rule
[05:59:51] exists what is the 3 second rule so you
[05:59:53] know you drop food you got 3 seconds to
[05:59:55] pick it up cuz once you drop it it
[05:59:56] applies dirt on it like instantly it's a
[05:59:58] little bit dirty but if you wait 3
[06:00:00] seconds that's the internal cool down I
[06:00:01] think before it reapplies
[06:00:03] dirt oh 5sec roll 5sec roll you're
[06:00:06] saying there's like end lag to
[06:00:08] application Flo
[06:00:12] second yeah there end
[06:00:18] lag isn't it three well I don't know
[06:00:20] whatever the yeah it depends on the
[06:00:23] floor Dirt has two youu
[06:00:26] oh dud you want to know the real food
[06:00:29] hack if if you like put peanut butter on
[06:00:32] toast right and then you drop it
[06:00:36] and then you pick it back up the peanut
[06:00:39] butter that's left on the toast hasn't
[06:00:40] actually touched the ground because all
[06:00:42] the peanut butter that's touch the
[06:00:44] ground is on the ground still wait is
[06:00:47] that a wait let me think about that let
[06:00:49] me wa no he's right he's right he's
[06:00:52] right no but some of it doesn't stick
[06:00:54] like it touches but it comes back
[06:00:56] no I guess it depends on your bread and
[06:00:58] peanut
[06:01:00] butter no no no no no I he's cing
[06:01:07] dude one time I dropped a watermelon and
[06:01:08] it cut open
[06:01:10] Perfectly yeah sure
[06:01:15] okay one time you also I mean Drake
[06:01:18] refresh your resin to wait I'm not okay
[06:01:20] this is actually true what are you
[06:01:21] talking about so Dr
[06:01:24] but they're both equally true
[06:01:28] okay are they
[06:01:32] not the peanut butter crystallized with
[06:01:34] the floor
[06:01:38] it's because there was so much peanut
[06:01:40] butter that the weak floor application
[06:01:44] from the floor uh didn't manage remove
[06:01:46] all the peanut butter
[06:01:48] Aura Aura dude I saw this I saw like

[06:07:59] like
[06:08:00] [ __ ] and like [ __ ] to say you're
[06:08:03] stuck on floor 11
[06:08:12] dude it's like a very uneven ceiling
[06:08:14] right like it's not a ceiling it's just
[06:08:16] like oh yeah there's there's a [ __ ]
[06:08:17] wooden beam there and then there's like
[06:08:19] a [ __ ] pipe and then there's just a
[06:08:22] bunch of different heights for
[06:08:24] everything and there's a lot of places
[06:08:26] that are significantly shorter than I am
[06:08:28] but not so short that they're in my
[06:08:31] field of vision you
[06:08:33] know why don't you just like move your
[06:08:35] your
[06:08:40] head you can also go to like a I mean

[06:08:48] just like build a bigger ceiling
[06:08:50] taller D I need to move that's what I

[06:08:53] do yeah just move out of your house
[06:08:58] yeah an apartment right I need to buy a
[06:09:01] house that's what I need to do I would
[06:09:04] buy um an apartment or condo and then
[06:09:06] just like sell it after cuz like I feel
[06:09:07] like the Market's either going up or
[06:09:09] we're all going to die you do you do not
[06:09:11] want to buy right now dude really okay I
[06:09:14] feel like it's going to burst but okay I
[06:09:15] feel like the bubble's going to burst
[06:09:16] but we've been saying that for like 15
[06:09:18] years no no it actually has gotten
[06:09:20] better this year but it's still
[06:09:23] bad
[06:09:24] like there's also the fact that like I
[06:09:28] can't just purchase a house you know oh
[06:09:30] yeah I'm not I'm not I'm not you wait
[06:09:34] you're a streamer you're literally a
[06:09:35] millionaire streamer sign with kick.com
[06:09:39] dude
[06:09:41] imagine dude you know they yed all
[06:09:43] [ __ ] RuneScape streamers have you
[06:09:45] seen that Z yeah I did everyone's on
[06:09:47] [ __ ] kick dude it's sad if it's
[06:09:50] useful I mean get that bag I guess
[06:09:52] whatever but I mean I guess it doesn't
[06:09:55] really change that much cuz I didn't
[06:09:56] watch many of them on I did and that
[06:10:00] hasn't like they still post videos on
[06:10:03] YouTube the the few I used to watch on
[06:10:05] Twitch I don't watch anymore how how
[06:10:07] much do you think they how much do you
[06:10:09] think they'd pay Gadget if they yed us
[06:10:12] all not enough y me wait kick yeah yeah
[06:10:16] I don't think I would but I'm
[06:10:19] saying three
[06:10:21] pulls I feel like genin viewers and osrs
[06:10:25] viewers are just too
[06:10:27] different fly withs viewers with genin
[06:10:30] viewers you are going to lose 90% of
[06:10:32] your audience dude yeah I cannot imagine
[06:10:35] viewers watching
[06:10:38] kick it's okay I'm okay no hate but like
[06:10:41] I tried going on there for R streamer I
[06:10:43] wanted to [ __ ] off myself in
[06:10:46] game I don't know dude like maybe in
[06:10:49] like 10 years but I actually wanted to
[06:10:51] [ __ ] [ __ ] bench myself I that kick
[06:10:54] is like its own thing nowadays it's just
[06:10:57] like you know YouTube's like a you know
[06:11:00] Melting Pot twitch is to and then kick
[06:11:02] is just
[06:11:03] like there's one content
[06:11:06] one day YouTube will just [ __ ] copy
[06:11:09] everything twitch does for the streaming
[06:11:11] side of things and they will immediately
[06:11:13] become the best [ __ ] platform dude
[06:11:14] they just need a website like give me a
[06:11:16] site that's just streaming where I'm not
[06:11:18] recommend bunch of video they actually
[06:11:19] okay I dude I swear to God like I feel
[06:11:23] like they could just actually make it
[06:11:25] good they're like so close but just do
[06:11:27] it yeah the they try it's like they they
[06:11:31] are the thing is it's like it's just
[06:11:35] like YouTube Google Google worldwide
[06:11:39] domination like there's so I don't know
[06:11:40] why I said that but there's so many
[06:11:42] levels of like things that go through I
[06:11:44] don't think they even are actually
[06:11:46] trying not profitable I've talked this
[06:11:49] I've talked I've literally talked with
[06:11:50] people that like from YouTube like
[06:11:52] streaming side and they're like hey we
[06:11:53] want to make this better and we told
[06:11:55] like I I gave them like some stuff and
[06:11:56] they literally Implement they like tried
[06:11:58] like they act I actually feel like
[06:12:00] they've added features that have helped
[06:12:01] YouTube streamers that I know but it's
[06:12:03] like all I genuinely think if there's
[06:12:06] just a website like a directory that's
[06:12:08] not cuz like how do I find a YouTube
[06:12:09] live streamer right now like genuinely
[06:12:12] how like I I can't it's going to be
[06:12:14] recommended to me maybe that's it yeah I
[06:12:17] mean honestly I don't think that's the
[06:12:18] worst part the worst part is
[06:12:22] just all the things that like it needs
[06:12:25] comes too slow because of all of the
[06:12:28] levels of like Authority they have to be
[06:12:30] approved by before it gets to the top
[06:12:33] that that's you remember mixer like yeah
[06:12:36] that that's what happened with mixer and
[06:12:38] then they shut down it's cuz Microsoft
[06:12:40] owned it but everything mixer wanted to
[06:12:42] do that twitch had took like like way
[06:12:46] too long to just get approved and then
[06:12:48] eventually Microsoft was just like I
[06:12:50] don't give a [ __ ] about this and then
[06:12:51] they shut it down yeah dude honestly
[06:12:55] like oh [ __ ] I forgot what I want to
[06:12:59] say did you know I was a mixer streamer
[06:13:02] I remember really yeah dude I stream
[06:13:05] smash BR ultimate cake
[06:13:08] Toano this is
[06:13:10] true smash
[06:13:15] ultimate yeah they buy like they bought
[06:13:17] like shroud and ninja and then y i i
[06:13:21] remember what I say yeah the worst part
[06:13:24] about YouTube streaming is is YouTube
[06:13:26] streaming viewers okay no disrespect I
[06:13:30] love my YouTube audience 100% it's not
[06:13:32] that bad there's just something about
[06:13:36] like your your your YouTube streaming
[06:13:38] account just being your base Google
[06:13:40] account instead of like an extra step to
[06:13:43] make an account that
[06:13:46] [Music]
[06:13:47] unleashes a a new type of people that
[06:13:50] doesn't exist on Twitch well you can fix
[06:13:52] that now it's not you don't have like
[06:13:55] well yeah I I just think there's a bit
[06:13:57] more of like because there's a bit more
[06:13:59] of everyone it's not a bad thing but it
[06:14:02] draws like for example I'll see some
[06:14:04] people of like I'll see like some dude
[06:14:05] with like his face as his profile
[06:14:07] picture and like his full name and it's
[06:14:08] like I don't want to like roast this guy
[06:14:09] when like his kid's right there and it's
[06:14:11] like like some of it is like weird like
[06:14:14] I I don't want to bring up like [ __ ]
[06:14:17] ass legal name saying [ __ ] and you're
[06:14:20] just
[06:14:21] sitting hey okay
[06:14:24] buddy I'm pretty sure you can change
[06:14:26] your name though nowadays so I don't
[06:14:27] think it's not that big of a problem I
[06:14:29] think it was a bigger problem than
[06:14:30] Facebook where like you just had your
[06:14:32] full name yeah [ __ ] Facebook I think
[06:14:35] I think Facebook's the one that's just
[06:14:36] [ __ ] usess I noticed YouTube also has
[06:14:39] like it's just more of a because
[06:14:41] everyone's there it's less of like
[06:14:43] gaming audience or like I feel like
[06:14:45] there's a lot more like oh no it's
[06:14:47] definitely no it's definitely like much
[06:14:48] like Norm is the word like it's
[06:14:49] definitely much more like not like gamer
[06:14:54] focused yeah like there are people who
[06:14:56] consume like food content cooking
[06:14:58] content reality TV shows it's not just
[06:15:00] like gaming only yeah Lament
[06:15:06] and then twit twitch twitch has the
[06:15:07] audience that's like much more
[06:15:11] uh I guess in
[06:15:13] general Society if twitch has a comp
[06:15:16] video
[06:15:18] player no I don't think oh what do you
[06:15:20] mean oh like player okay yeah truly an
[06:15:22] extra what do you mean player like like
[06:15:25] like if you could rewind while watching
[06:15:29] oh like YouTube If you could
[06:15:33] pause like
[06:15:35] bro
[06:15:36] I that would be
[06:15:39] crazy there was a tweet about u i I
[06:15:41] don't know who it was from twitch but
[06:15:43] they like mentioned like it's possible
[06:15:45] but it would take like a lot of work in
[06:15:48] resources cuz like they they've been
[06:15:50] running on the same [ __ ] for like years
[06:15:53] right yeah and it's like no one's really
[06:15:56] asked for it enough to
[06:15:58] like have it beot believe that like what
[06:16:02] do you mean no one I mean to be fair
[06:16:04] like I AG agree with you entirely but I
[06:16:05] never thought about asking for it yeah
[06:16:08] exactly I'm just like oh D I wish this
[06:16:10] was better they just like don't give
[06:16:12] enough [ __ ] it's like I cannot watch
[06:16:16] Twitch streams on
[06:16:19] my always like 50 seconds
[06:16:22] behind Okay but your laptop is a toaster
[06:16:25] oven yeah but like
[06:16:27] that's yeah yeah yeah twitch is
[06:16:29] unwatchable on shitty specs or shitty
[06:16:33] internet h I mean I don't I feel like
[06:16:35] it's gotten better for mobile like
[06:16:37] there's like less
[06:16:38] DeLay mobile it's fine on laptop or a
[06:16:41] shitty PC it's
[06:16:46] not to kind of [ __ ] too yeah
[06:16:49] accessibility and like uh what's the
[06:16:51] word um optimization of the website is
[06:16:53] definitely
[06:16:56] [ __ ] yeah I
[06:17:00] agree like it still works I mean it's
[06:17:03] like I like the community lot like
[06:17:05] that's the main for me that's what no
[06:17:07] other platform has replaced like I not
[06:17:09] to be like parasocial but like I
[06:17:10] genuinely like a lot of twitch Chatters
[06:17:13] like I kind of like I think I think
[06:17:15] twitch chat a lot of times ends up
[06:17:16] mimicking your humor which I find like
[06:17:20] obviously I find that
[06:17:22] funny are you saying that your humor is
[06:17:24] just saying booa no okay there's some
[06:17:28] weirdos obviously there's some weirdos
[06:17:30] but like I think a lot of times uh like
[06:17:32] twitch out is a lot more
[06:17:36] like um I it feels more like a okay this
[06:17:40] sounds parasocial but it feels more
[06:17:42] like a
[06:17:45] family no you're right I mean it's
[06:17:47] definitely more Community focused which
[06:17:49] was like the the main idea of streaming
[06:17:52] in the first place I just laughed at an
[06:17:53] aboba I'm so I'm
[06:17:59] [ __ ] you're quote unquote
[06:18:03] humor the hum
[06:18:05] question okay well
[06:18:08] whatever why is there a holy mint

[06:21:00] enough 191 on [ __ ] fing that's more
[06:21:03] than enough
[06:21:05] I prefer my
[06:21:08] 281 that
[06:21:13] is all right Jake what's your favorite
[06:21:15] archon Quest all
[06:21:17] time there is
[06:21:23] answer we're above the others you can
[06:21:26] say one of your favorites if you want
[06:21:28] like story line like this is this is
[06:21:30] like a archon like like like the region
[06:21:34] no just any like you could say region
[06:21:36] but I was thinking like any like
[06:21:38] particular genion Quest you did that
[06:21:39] you're like
[06:21:42] damn mine is like mine's always like
[06:21:45] finina Fontaine like that I I feel like
[06:21:48] okay that was just in my opinion yo let
[06:21:52] him speak what is what is the objetive
[06:21:56] and if you think anything else you're
[06:21:58] just objectively wrong bro
[06:22:00] that okay I think Carri bear is top tier
[06:22:03] but however good but that it's four of
[06:22:06] the best Quest they've ever done I was
[06:22:07] thinking when I heard archon Quest I was
[06:22:09] thinking
[06:22:10] archon I know it is AR Quest act or
[06:22:15] chapter 3 interlude yeah yeah I know I
[06:22:18] know it's part of the Aron Quest Z's
[06:22:21] Quest takes a little k w but car bear is
[06:22:23] goed no they're they're real and
[06:22:27] based it was it was a good quest for
[06:22:30] sure I did really like the [ __ ]
[06:22:32] finina one though uh a lot no the free
[06:22:36] one just like hit getting lost here but
[06:22:38] also the [ __ ] um I'm doing this chest
[06:22:40] I don't care but also um I like the what
[06:22:44] the [ __ ] is
[06:22:53] this uh I also liked
[06:22:55] um like the niita quest line a lot too
[06:22:58] where you kept waking up
[06:23:01] beep and
[06:23:05] oh no that was really good but I thought
[06:23:07] it was very I was pretty predictable
[06:23:11] what was the
[06:23:14] worst mean it's [ __ ]
[06:23:19] yeahum I literally I literally blocked
[06:23:22] it out of my memory I was redoing free
[06:23:23] to like Quest my free to play account I
[06:23:24] was like I literally like didn't
[06:23:26] remember
[06:23:27] anything it's better that way but I I
[06:23:30] relearned it again experienc it for the
[06:23:32] first time that's probably
[06:23:36] do Ena Zumo though is always going to be
[06:23:38] the most popular like Normie region like
[06:23:41] I feel like as a casual player you're
[06:23:43] going to be like oo POG Japan and then
[06:23:45] like all the like Ryden Shogun pulls a
[06:23:47] sword out of her [ __ ] boobs and
[06:23:48] you're like oh my
[06:23:49] God so like I like in like I like a lot
[06:23:52] of the inuma characters like I love
[06:23:53] kokomi and [ __ ] but I feel like a lot of
[06:23:55] the story was kind of just
[06:23:56] like the whole region was amazing I mean
[06:23:59] every every region was but like the the
[06:24:01] way the story was told in Inazuma
[06:24:04] definitely um not the best
[06:24:08] executed yeah I also I know there's like
[06:24:11] lore reasons for this this has nothing
[06:24:12] to do with bad writing this is literally
[06:24:13] just me being tilted I hate when they
[06:24:16] introduce a character as a name and then
[06:24:17] everyone learns that name and then they
[06:24:18] introduce another one oh [ __ ] you it's
[06:24:20] that name now and then there's like a
[06:24:21] third one oh [ __ ] you it was a puppet
[06:24:22] [ __ ] you I'm
[06:24:24] sorry dude there characters have like
[06:24:26] eight
[06:24:27] names Ryden has eight names Scara has
[06:24:30] eight names tarag has eight names all
[06:24:32] good oh it's actually a puppet and her
[06:24:35] former self and then a is actually
[06:24:39] Babb all
[06:24:42] good yeah honestly that's fair dude I
[06:24:45] recorded my first riding guide calling
[06:24:46] her

[06:25:26] pink shot said inuma was
[06:25:30] good it was fun like I enjoyed inuma did
[06:25:33] you
[06:25:35] yeah the first new region that sick but
[06:25:37] like a lot of the like like the quest I
[06:25:40] remember being so hyp logging on and
[06:25:42] then like logging off after 30 you did
[06:25:45] that all the time scar came out you
[06:25:46] started playing Shia cuz you're like
[06:25:48] okay I just order how to play Shia okay
[06:25:50] to be fair but now you're erasing now
[06:25:52] you're like oh scar is better no the
[06:25:54] [ __ ] he's not sit the [ __ ] down sorry
[06:25:56] that first for him was so bad yeah the
[06:25:58] first scar of this was terrible for scar
[06:26:00] same with Ryden Ryan's first this was
[06:26:01] high tide low tide yeah like like like
[06:26:03] he had
[06:26:04] an abyss that was made for him but it
[06:26:06] came out like a few days after the Patch
[06:26:08] that was the most tilted I remember like
[06:26:10] recording that before he came out like a
[06:26:12] bit of footage that was the most tilted
[06:26:14] I've been in the abyss like I almost
[06:26:15] broke something like I actually was like
[06:26:17] I played Scara CZ fariz on no Shield I
[06:26:21] genuinely almost broke my monitor like
[06:26:22] I'm not even
[06:26:24] joking no Shield it was yeah and there's
[06:26:27] like mols running at you farzon c0 Scara
[06:26:31] I oh my God cuz you're in the air you
[06:26:33] get hit by anything think I have to
[06:26:35] reset wait why no Shield cuz I was
[06:26:38] playing like like what team am I going
[06:26:40] to play C6 Toma sure but like I was
[06:26:41] trying to play like quote unquote good
[06:26:43] team like I was trying to play like farz
[06:26:45] on Bennett and then like I don't
[06:26:46] remember what I was playing but I had no
[06:26:49] Shield but yes just say that without C6
[06:26:53] parizon W kind of needs a little bit of
[06:26:58] extra yeah but that was just a bad that
[06:27:01] was a bad of this room to be fair yeah
[06:27:03] it was they do that sometimes where the
[06:27:06] abyss of the character is just so [ __ ]
[06:27:08] anyways point being
[06:27:11] okay I am excused for behaving the way I
[06:27:15] did on Wanderer release
[06:27:18] okay like like they gave a really they
[06:27:21] released Wanderer on a really good
[06:27:23] shower bit
[06:27:25] okay how about taking a
[06:27:30] shower
[06:27:31] okay that that that is something
[06:27:38] okay true I mean high tide low tide was
[06:27:42] like actual ass it made energy useless
[06:27:44] and they released the energy archon that
[06:27:46] is true that that is
[06:27:49] true no it's not a do you literally
[06:27:51] can't argue it you damage is
[06:27:54] good I agree that it it was dumb to put
[06:27:58] it right as you release ryen that was
[06:28:00] Omega stupid but I think that high tie
[06:28:03] low side was kind of POG and I wish they
[06:28:05] did more oh yeah yeah sure modifiers to
[06:28:08] abys 12 cuz it's kind of boring yeah I
[06:28:11] wish a 12 wasn't always no changes
[06:28:13] that's fair but like dude that [ __ ] high
[06:28:15] tide low tide with
[06:28:20] Ryden you abys
[06:28:24] mode I would I would
[06:28:28] come would you I
[06:28:31] would yeah I was watching a DG video

[06:28:49] ejaculating okay that's cool yeah and I
[06:28:53] don't know it just it just made me think
[06:28:54] of

[06:29:01] you even say that well cuz say come all
[06:29:04] the time okay but you can't think

[06:29:16] just named 100 women in
[06:29:23] me I have no
[06:29:32] words I just got back with the vote
[06:29:34] nothing it yo yo this is not what the
[06:29:37] stream normally is about
[06:29:39] necessary anyways that is that is please
[06:29:43] don't clip
[06:29:47] that
[06:29:50] anyways dude Honestly though it was kind
[06:29:52] of a banger I love Doug Doug's
[06:29:55] videos yeah I watched like two I think
[06:29:57] but they're good I admire you missed one
[06:30:00] of the stor by the way wait really yeah
[06:30:03] no trolling I was thinking doing saw it
[06:30:06] okay this L I was thinking of doing the
[06:30:09] he made a video of uh him right bottom
[06:30:13] bottom left whatever just there what the
[06:30:18] [ __ ] oh my
[06:30:20] God wait I I I am actually incredibly
[06:30:25] glad for D twitch Chatters because I
[06:30:28] would not have the patience to watch a
[06:30:30] man Cod for 4
[06:30:32] hours and like his videos are so good
[06:30:35] and they probably wouldn't exist without
[06:30:37] his twitch
[06:30:39] viewers so it's
[06:30:42] like YouTube viewers are actually
[06:30:45] blessed it's kind of it's kind of
[06:30:48] insane um um why cuz they like don't
[06:30:51] know
[06:30:53] [ __ ]
[06:30:54] mind like they don't know messages I
[06:30:58] I'm you're not
[06:31:00] explaining I literally LED with an
[06:31:03] explanation you said I like
[06:31:07] chat I don't think I ever said that this
[06:31:12] W this a wild conversation listen
[06:31:15] to dude my sensitivity you guys consider
[06:31:18] streaming on YouTube and twitch at the
[06:31:20] same
[06:31:21] time yeah I would consider it I don't
[06:31:25] think would I think Jake you have
[06:31:27] right I
[06:31:30] stream events on YouTube that's it
[06:31:32] though I don't stream like
[06:31:35] I'll stream a live stream on YouTube
[06:31:36] that's it
[06:31:38] cuz yeah the majority like my my
[06:31:41] audience is not actually like twitch
[06:31:43] they're not they're not at its core
[06:31:46] they're very like YouTube or like Tik
[06:31:48] Tok or like uh other
[06:31:52] platforms like not not necessarily
[06:31:56] gaming Focus so it just makes more sense
[06:31:57] for me to be on
[06:32:01] YouTube entirely ttch
[06:32:04] yeah I can tell
[06:32:07] yeah I think YouTube's smart if you uh
[06:32:10] if it's like a themed like rewatchable
[06:32:13] like today we're doing X right yeah yeah
[06:32:16] yeah yeah it's really it's kind of hard
[06:32:18] cuz like yeah it's like YouTube it's not
[06:32:20] really like cozy whereas like twitch you
[06:32:24] can like just hop on and be like yo
[06:32:25] what's up guys I'm going to like fre my
[06:32:26] [ __ ] today live and then everyone's like
[06:32:28] yeah freaking [ __ ] but on YouTube
[06:32:32] what anyway so on YouTube it's more like
[06:32:35] are you going to freak your
[06:32:38] what so was on YouTube It's
[06:32:42] Like on YouTube is like yeah it's much
[06:32:45] more like people expect something some
[06:32:47] kind of content yeah yeah some kind of
[06:32:49] some kind of like gist or scheme or like
[06:32:52] uh what's it called uh like gimmick to
[06:32:55] happen on today on like the day of the
[06:32:57] stream yeah I feel
[06:33:01] that there's like a certain expectation
[06:33:05] yeah yeah I I I've I mean honestly like
[06:33:09] that's kind of how I feel about genin
[06:33:10] sometimes where it's like I need to like
[06:33:12] do something or I'm just like running
[06:33:15] around oh yeah I feel that but I kind of
[06:33:20] like stopped streaming for a while
[06:33:21] because of it yeah like if anything I'm
[06:33:23] I'm definitely just a YouTuber streaming
[06:33:25] is like I want it to be something but
[06:33:27] then like I'll have burst of like
[06:33:30] streaming and then I'll just get to a
[06:33:31] pointment with like well
[06:33:36] I want us to be
[06:33:39] something but yeah no I agree like yeah
[06:33:42] YouTube's also more like I feel like
[06:33:44] sometimes it's
[06:33:46] like a like a b like um Boba AB
[06:33:51] Boba okay this is going to sound cringe
[06:33:53] but it's like more of like an almost an
[06:33:55] art form like not art art but like what
[06:33:59] 78
[06:34:01] particles not for you oh okay there like
[06:34:04] a bunch but like it's more like I would
[06:34:07] upload something I'm proud of but like
[06:34:09] streaming like I'm I'm cranking my sh
[06:34:12] says that but uploaded is ALB guys dude
[06:34:15] why are you like dude it's like three
[06:34:16] years old
[06:34:19] sorry but yeah keep it coming keep it
[06:34:22] coming I don't know it's more of like
[06:34:25] also sometimes when I stream I feel like
[06:34:27] I'm wasting my time if it's like not
[06:34:29] turned into like a video I don't know if
[06:34:31] that makes sense I no I know exactly
[06:34:33] what you mean it's
[06:34:35] like no I know what you mean it's kind
[06:34:37] of like a curse cuz like you go on to
[06:34:39] stream and the point is to like relax
[06:34:41] and have a good time with the community
[06:34:43] but then at the same time it's like well
[06:34:45] it if I'm relaxing it doesn't feel like
[06:34:48] I'm
[06:34:49] working and then you have this
[06:34:51] expectation where it's like okay well I
[06:34:53] need to be working somehow or feel like
[06:34:54] I'm working
[06:34:56] yeah yeah yeah yeah well it's like
[06:34:59] you're doing good content and then it's
[06:35:00] like well this could have been like a
[06:35:02] this could be a good like video or this
[06:35:04] could be a good like something and then
[06:35:05] it's like not and then I'm like oh well
[06:35:07] minus [ __ ] 10
[06:35:10] hours I'll never experience that all of
[06:35:12] my videos turn out
[06:35:14] great okay no but I'm talking about like
[06:35:16] things that don't end up being
[06:35:18] videos thank you a
[06:35:20] Jeff thank you
[06:35:22] congrats can't relate to talented
[06:35:26] true
[06:35:32] yeah you know you've done more genu
[06:35:36] exploration like in this ho than I have
[06:35:39] since it came out yeah I mean Loki like
[06:35:41] same since before this moment I did the
[06:35:43] world quest though with the [ __ ] like
[06:35:45] dude I'm not going to lie this is like
[06:35:48] my like you know Subway Ser vid I'm just
[06:35:50] watching you run around like as like
[06:35:52] just listen a podcast essentially that's
[06:35:54] what genjin streaming is honestly oh
[06:35:57] yeah I've always said it's just chatting
[06:35:58] impact it's literally just chatting with
[06:36:00] a game
[06:36:01] background bro is to take own over just
[06:36:05] chatting imp streamers should just like
[06:36:09] everyone should just be in a call at all
[06:36:11] times like that's infinite content that
[06:36:13] that's that's what I like like like
[06:36:16] valerin streamers you you hop in you get
[06:36:18] in a Lobby and it's just like you play a
[06:36:20] game together but like genin's Co-op is
[06:36:23] just so like yeah it's pretty it's
[06:36:26] pretty BR but games like valerant it's
[06:36:29] like you also watch people to get better
[06:36:31] genin like there there is that to some
[06:36:32] extent if you're like trying to learn
[06:36:34] but like for the most part it's just
[06:36:35] watch you yo what is with all these
[06:36:41] shots well literally uncalled
[06:36:45] for the the game knowledge of a
[06:36:48] Goliath call me
[06:36:51] David I don't know I don't know where
[06:36:53] the [ __ ] this chest is though any I was
[06:36:54] going to defend you but I changed my
[06:36:56] mind okay but yeah I wish we did have
[06:37:00] real Co-op dude imagine raids I would
[06:37:02] actually like have to change my
[06:37:05] pants that no that that's the like if
[06:37:07] they added any sort of like this is the
[06:37:09] thing about like zzz especially it's
[06:37:11] like okay genin greatest free open world
[06:37:15] like star raell one of the best
[06:37:16] turn-based RPGs now on like all on
[06:37:18] mobile what the [ __ ] is zzz doing like
[06:37:21] what what are they doing right now furry
[06:37:23] furry bait what best furry game of all
[06:37:26] time un ironically like everything I've
[06:37:29] seen from like marketing material out of
[06:37:31] zzz just seems like like they know their
[06:37:35] audience and it's cbers and they are
[06:37:38] embracing it fully I respect that yeah
[06:37:41] but then it's like gameplay-wise
[06:37:43] like at the
[06:37:45] end yeah like like what what what are
[06:37:48] people going to come back to play for
[06:37:49] essentially that that isn't like
[06:37:53] aesthetic wise I enjoyed the combat but
[06:37:55] like I didn't like the out of combat
[06:37:58] like I wish if it was all combat I'd
[06:38:00] have fun I didn't like going through the
[06:38:02] TVs and like reading the comic book but
[06:38:04] I enjoy the combat so it's like a weird
[06:38:07] the visual novel I'm I don't know how
[06:38:09] that's going to play out to be honest it
[06:38:11] feels very
[06:38:12] like I don't know I mean yeah the gaml
[06:38:17] right now is like kind of Rog likee
[06:38:19] which is like okay
[06:38:21] but I I I if they added like Co-op like
[06:38:26] that would save the game I feel like a
[06:38:28] lot of games that aren't fully Rog likee
[06:38:30] give Rog like features without giving
[06:38:32] like the good part like it's like almost
[06:38:34] good it's like Rog likes need like
[06:38:36] progression like out of game where it
[06:38:38] feels like you're progressing even if
[06:38:39] you like lose or get [ __ ] and like
[06:38:40] there's like a reward that you're like
[06:38:41] looking forward to like yes like I found
[06:38:43] this in the TV or like a lot of like a
[06:38:46] lot of games like RuneScape okay
[06:38:47] RuneScape released a game mode recently
[06:38:49] that has like a [ __ ] Rogue like
[06:38:50] system and it's so [ __ ] because it's
[06:38:51] just you lose you lose you lose and it's
[06:38:53] like there's no progression and like
[06:38:54] aenis kind of has like some stuff but
[06:38:56] it's like talking about Coliseum the
[06:38:58] invocations are literally just debuffing
[06:38:59] you there's nothing to look forward to
[06:39:00] soon as you get [ __ ] by RNG and you
[06:39:02] have to lose an hour of your life 20
[06:39:03] minutes the it's no but it's like it's
[06:39:06] like a kind of Rog like system where
[06:39:07] it's new it's a different run every time
[06:39:08] it's fully random anyways but it's
[06:39:12] like the reason why I think they don't
[06:39:14] add like the fullon like experience of a
[06:39:17] a Rog like Sim like game it's it's
[06:39:19] because like it's it's mihoyo at the end
[06:39:21] of the day and they can't make it
[06:39:23] ultimately competitive at its core where
[06:39:26] people will just like yeah
[06:39:29] H they can't they they won't put players
[06:39:32] against each other essentially
[06:39:35] okay to be fair star rails Sim I think
[06:39:37] simulated universe is sick like the the
[06:39:39] idea of it and like a lot of like the
[06:39:42] like I don't like farming like sometimes
[06:39:44] like now it's easy for me I don't like
[06:39:45] farming for a [ __ ] Ryden uh what's
[06:39:47] her name Arron's [ __ ] ball like it's
[06:39:49] annoying but it's like I enjoy the simul
[06:39:51] universe mechanics I enjoy golden gears
[06:39:53] swarm like that's kind of a like you
[06:39:55] know it's a different run every time
[06:39:57] it's cool oh yeah that's good yeah
[06:40:00] honestly the the cynic in me feels like
[06:40:05] hoyo is never going to add that sort of
[06:40:07] stuff in their games because they don't
[06:40:10] want to add too much non swiping
[06:40:14] gaml they want the game I don't know I
[06:40:17] don't think that's true I don't I don't
[06:40:18] I don't they especially not for Star
[06:40:21] rail though cuz I feel like they want to
[06:40:23] funnel you to other games like I feel
[06:40:25] like they want you to play other games
[06:40:26] right that's like
[06:40:27] logical I don't know about that actually
[06:40:30] really like okay I don't think like
[06:40:32] genjin think about star think about
[06:40:33] genin but I think like if for example
[06:40:35] they're like okay like if genin players
[06:40:37] are missing something and they' be like
[06:40:40] okay well you can find this in Star rail
[06:40:42] like go get your endgame go get your
[06:40:43] [ __ ] okay yeah yeah so yeah I know
[06:40:45] what you're saying it's like it's like
[06:40:46] how Riot right now is like making every
[06:40:48] single [ __ ] game genre on the world
[06:40:49] like fighting game um shooting game MOBA
[06:40:52] game moo is trying to like do that right
[06:40:55] now with like their RPG games right now
[06:40:58] is what it feels
[06:41:01] like yeah I mean I don't know like I
[06:41:04] don't know I also think
[06:41:07] like I don't know like one of the
[06:41:11] reasons yeah I don't know the fact that
[06:41:14] it's gacha always tilts me cuz it's like
[06:41:16] I feel like a lot of changes aren't
[06:41:17] going to be added because it's gacha but
[06:41:18] like that's what the game is right like
[06:41:20] for
[06:41:22] example I don't know no it's hard for
[06:41:25] sure like yeah at the end of the day if
[06:41:28] they're going to make a change it has to
[06:41:30] be marketable yeah exactly and you're
[06:41:32] never going to get something like like a
[06:41:33] skip button even if you don't want it
[06:41:34] like something like that can't happen
[06:41:36] because it's like well you have to see
[06:41:38] the character so you're like oh my God
[06:41:39] she's so cute and then you swipe like
[06:41:41] that's the right like I don't give like
[06:41:45] I'm not going to lie Nita before I did
[06:41:47] Nita's Quest stupid ass toddler get the
[06:41:49] [ __ ] out of here but like I did okay
[06:41:51] she's a cool character no like real like
[06:41:53] I'm not playing a [ __ ] child in this
[06:41:54] game full of like hot men and women like
[06:41:57] I'm not playing a [ __ ] toddler [ __ ]
[06:41:58] you but like I played her she's fun as
[06:42:00] [ __ ] I saw the story Quest cool design
[06:42:03] like backstory whatever not like you
[06:42:05] know what I mean like the lore was cool
[06:42:06] I'm like
[06:42:07] okay I mean you're right at the end of
[06:42:10] the day cuz like the story was the
[06:42:12] market ploy to get you to like pull for
[06:42:14] heren yeah it's good story like the
[06:42:16] really good story but a lot of it is for
[06:42:18] me it's like I'll see finina just
[06:42:21] visually I'll be like okay like you know
[06:42:22] maybe I'll pull I don't know I'll do a
[06:42:24] quest like oh [ __ ] I love finina like I
[06:42:26] need
[06:42:27] finina
[06:42:28] so but if there a skip button I wouldn't
[06:42:31] get that I just [ __ ] skip through it
[06:42:32] or like me personally I would do the
[06:42:34] Aron Quest but I'm saying you know yeah
[06:42:35] anys that's kind of why there isn't a
[06:42:37] skip button I mean like even in Star
[06:42:39] like there's a skip button but it's only
[06:42:41] for like stuff you've already like seen
[06:42:43] yeah I think world quest should but
[06:42:45] maybe that's my toxic take I don't know
[06:42:48] honestly I I think the most egregious
[06:42:50] thing isn't even the lack of a skip
[06:42:52] button it's that the text rolls out
[06:42:55] slower than you can read yeah yeah
[06:42:58] sometimes you can't click sit there it's
[06:42:59] like when you're walking behind someone
[06:43:01] who's walking just a little bit too SL
[06:43:04] that [ __ ] pisses me off [ __ ] annoying
[06:43:06] you're like St get best I I that [ __ ]
[06:43:09] happens to me every time I go to [ __ ]
[06:43:10] New York bro I'm like what what am I
[06:43:12] supposed to do like [ __ ] out of
[06:43:14] here
[06:43:18] yeah I wouldn't mind the lack of a skip
[06:43:21] button if the text roll out happened at
[06:43:22] a speed where I could just be masching
[06:43:24] space bar and just reading you know yeah
[06:43:27] I I I mean yeah I also like my second
[06:43:31] account has to go every like I'm the
[06:43:32] only I'm not fully maxed on my free Play
[06:43:34] account is I don't feel like sitting
[06:43:37] through every archon Quest again and I
[06:43:38] can't skip through it like there's
[06:43:40] nothing I can do I have to [ __ ] I
[06:43:41] need sapwood blade I'm G to have to save
[06:43:43] the [ __ ]
[06:43:45] rnrs I mean I I can't say genin caters
[06:43:50] towards multiple account well yeah I
[06:43:51] know but
[06:43:54] like yeah like objectively it would help
[06:43:57] people if they could skip through some
[06:44:00] stuff but it would hurt like the revenue
[06:44:01] of characters so it won't happen right
[06:44:04] like but
[06:44:07] yeah certain dialogue that just like
[06:44:09] slows down and you can't like skip
[06:44:13] yeah yes it does that I do think having
[06:44:17] something that would cater to like MMO
[06:44:19] player not MMO what's the word well
[06:44:20] maybe MMO or RPG like one okay my point
[06:44:23] is one Co-op thing that could get me to
[06:44:25] tell my friends dude my friends I I've
[06:44:27] said this for like since I started
[06:44:29] playing my friends will be like yo I
[06:44:30] want to play like should I play genin
[06:44:32] with you I'm like we literally can't do
[06:44:33] [ __ ] like you you could play the game
[06:44:34] it's good but like what the [ __ ] are we
[06:44:36] going to do together like you're going
[06:44:37] to do a domain I'm going to clear it in
[06:44:39] 2 seconds and then you're going to go to
[06:44:41] bed like a bunch of people in in in Nick
[06:44:45] and I's high school friend group started
[06:44:47] playing gon and just quit as soon as
[06:44:49] they realized there was no end game or
[06:44:52] like Co like we're not going to do [ __ ]
[06:44:54] together like I'm not going to like if I
[06:44:55] could okay even if exploring together
[06:44:58] like the chess would register to my
[06:44:59] world or some [ __ ] I don't know like
[06:45:00] give me a reason there's no reason
[06:45:06] I don't know I mean exploring together
[06:45:08] is pretty cool actually but it is no
[06:45:10] 100% but like but you can't unlock like
[06:45:12] statues of the seven in that's what I'm
[06:45:15] saying like if if they synced like if
[06:45:17] they had an like think about there's an
[06:45:19] option in your settings like sync
[06:45:21] exploration and Co-op like so that way
[06:45:23] if people want to do it alone they can
[06:45:24] do it alone who the [ __ ] cares no one
[06:45:26] cares about you but if you want to do it
[06:45:27] together you can no friend abute sorry
[06:45:31] yeah I didn't say all that but
[06:45:33] my point speaking speaking of like
[06:45:36] optional things and like changes and
[06:45:38] whatever okay I wish that when they made
[06:45:41] it so that like artifact wait laa sorry
[06:45:45] what the [ __ ] who's Uncle L okay my bad
[06:45:48] keep talking you wish I wish that when
[06:45:51] they made it so that artifact domains
[06:45:52] don't have their drops like drop down
[06:45:55] and instead just directly just show up I
[06:45:58] wish they made that an option instead of
[06:46:00] just [ __ ] rolling it out oh yeah the
[06:46:03] artifacts that used to be on the ground
[06:46:04] you mean they look SI dude I miss that I
[06:46:06] I like I like matching F and hearing the
[06:46:10] yeah or seeing the gold I miss it too it
[06:46:13] makes me feel happy
[06:46:16] inside that is a very Niche take but I
[06:46:19] know most people don't care I mean I
[06:46:20] don't really like long term I don't care
[06:46:21] but it would be nice to be able to do it
[06:46:24] okay but I'm also tilted by the [ __ ]
[06:46:26] hold on yeah we're talking about wanting
[06:46:29] quality of life features in a genjin
[06:46:33] just just like the preface we're asking
[06:46:35] for quality of life features anyway
[06:46:38] continue yeah dude okay uh this is
[06:46:41] something that I also think most people
[06:46:42] don't care about but it bothers me I I
[06:46:44] think there a I mean I don't know maybe
[06:46:46] it's just for Content but I like the the
[06:46:50] artif when I roll an artifact for it to
[06:46:51] pop up and show me what I
[06:46:53] got like I don't know if people actually
[06:46:56] like I feel like most people don't care
[06:46:57] like it's whatever but like I don't know
[06:46:59] like I can't make it hype anymore it's
[06:47:00] just like oh defense okay well
[06:47:04] I don't yeah
[06:47:07] say it's definitely a good thing that
[06:47:09] they remove the popup for like to level
[06:47:11] up yeah for like ascending characters
[06:47:13] and [ __ ] the sub R like should still be
[06:47:17] a up
[06:47:21] yeah why don't they also just add like
[06:47:23] the the indicator of how many like rolls
[06:47:27] a substack got upgraded yeah it's a star
[06:47:30] rail thing they I [ __ ]
[06:47:33] pieces so much easier
[06:47:35] man people don't realize people call
[06:47:38] them the death pieces they're just like
[06:47:41] oh four RS on defense yeah genin's been
[06:47:44] getting more quality life but it's still
[06:47:45] like we need like you know every quality
[06:47:48] of life we're getting is like half a
[06:47:51] quality of life feature that is like
[06:47:53] pretending to be something that people
[06:47:55] want but it's just not yeah and I feel
[06:47:57] like it's it's not proactive it's
[06:48:00] reactive they're only doing it because
[06:48:02] like oh no weathering wav is coming or
[06:48:04] oh no star rail is being star rail based
[06:48:07] as [ __ ] it's like I I sure eventually
[06:48:10] will'll get it but I wish it was coming
[06:48:12] from the right
[06:48:14] um what's the word the the right the
[06:48:17] right place the right yeah come like
[06:48:19] coming from the right there's there's a
[06:48:21] better word guys help me out there's a
[06:48:22] better there's a better word intentions
[06:48:25] yes
[06:48:26] exactly personally I don't give a [ __ ]
[06:48:28] what the intentions are give me real
[06:48:29] artifact presets but I I get what you're
[06:48:31] saying yeah it shouldn't just be like
[06:48:32] react to oh we're afraid of
[06:48:35] this um yeah I'm just thinking more like
[06:48:37] conceptually as a principal like make me
[06:48:40] Happ are like I definitely agree I also
[06:48:44] know that that's never going to happen
[06:48:46] cuz they're a g of comp they're not
[06:48:48] going to want to do things for you
[06:48:50] because they want to make you happy and
[06:48:52] have a good experience they're going to
[06:48:54] do things because it makes them money
[06:48:57] yeah that's true with
[06:48:59] most sure sure we'll get like okay
[06:49:02] artifact loadouts like who knows who
[06:49:04] [ __ ] if I know 3 years from now right
[06:49:07] but like if they had their right
[06:49:08] intentions we could have had it like day
[06:49:09] one rql from feedback well that's not
[06:49:12] not really like yes for like like let's
[06:49:15] say people feedback oh dea's skill
[06:49:17] should last longer they burst like I'm
[06:49:19] jumping and it cancels what if I get
[06:49:21] Frozen like what the [ __ ] is this
[06:49:22] character that's like okay you need
[06:49:24] feedback for that sure but like let's
[06:49:26] say you're just like hey like you know
[06:49:27] we feel like our players [ __ ] it let's
[06:49:29] make constellations toggleable like no
[06:49:31] one's even talking about that anymore
[06:49:32] but like they're like you know or some
[06:49:34] [ __ ] where it's just like hey maybe we
[06:49:35] you know we care about you guys here's
[06:49:37] something
[06:49:39] cool they do care about us they gave us
[06:49:42] artifact don't lie don't lie don't sorry
[06:49:45] sorry I mean artifact load outs they
[06:49:46] renamed them from presets because they
[06:49:48] knew it wasn't
[06:49:50] presets that's slightly
[06:49:54] better but yeah I mean this this comes
[06:49:56] from like
[06:49:58] the yeah this comes from the I love this
[06:50:02] game and I wanted to succeed just give
[06:50:03] me a little bit more a bit yeah it's
[06:50:06] like after you know I used to fell out
[06:50:08] every [ __ ] survey every survey to and
[06:50:12] then I the third y just stopped because
[06:50:13] I was like I nothing is happening fast
[06:50:17] enough and you can you can see it in so
[06:50:19] of the questions it's it's the the way
[06:50:21] they're asking questions and the way
[06:50:23] they're collecting data it looks more
[06:50:25] like a okay I need to collect data to
[06:50:27] show my boss that I'm doing okay rather
[06:50:30] than I'm actually looking for feedback
[06:50:32] on things to improve did you guys read
[06:50:34] the interview between uh uh the the lead
[06:50:38] producer of the honai series and FG I
[06:50:41] heard about that it's a really
[06:50:43] interesting article to read you just
[06:50:44] totally like look I did not read it
[06:50:45] should I pull it out honestly it's a
[06:50:47] it's worth a look because you get to see
[06:50:49] like kind of like the decision making on
[06:50:51] moyo's end specifically hon Kai's but
[06:50:53] you can definitely like imagine how like
[06:50:55] genin would also act similar like one of
[06:50:58] the most interesting things
[06:51:00] they uh was transl in the article was
[06:51:04] that uh public opinion won't influence
[06:51:08] changing a like character design
[06:51:10] decision or anything and I was just like
[06:51:14] I mean that makes complete
[06:51:16] sense but at the same time we've seen
[06:51:19] like we've
[06:51:21] seen yeah yeah I was I was about to say
[06:51:23] like it makes sense but we've also
[06:51:26] seen that not like actually happened
[06:51:29] though before I mean this how this is
[06:51:31] only genin because again this is this is
[06:51:33] the honai like producer saying this not
[06:51:36] the genjin yeah although to be fair we
[06:51:39] have kind of seen that like I know they
[06:51:40] fixed wrong League or whatever but like
[06:51:42] I feel like Ryden was a big thing yo Mia
[06:51:46] people were saying we're broken kokomi
[06:51:47] everyone was crying about and then DEA
[06:51:49] is still like de so I feel like if they
[06:51:51] did like listen to people more there
[06:51:53] would be I feel like there would be some
[06:51:55] changes at least to
[06:51:56] DEA no no no no you're right but it's
[06:51:58] like no no yeah I it makes sense it's
[06:52:01] Jing was like such a special one cuz
[06:52:03] it's like yeah it's an archon straight
[06:52:04] it's straight from as well like straight
[06:52:06] from like their like culture essentially
[06:52:09] yeah like only is the god of the region
[06:52:12] that's supposed to represent China yeah
[06:52:14] and so like when the entire Chinese
[06:52:15] Community like mean something different
[06:52:18] than character you know I I do feel like
[06:52:20] that specifically is a
[06:52:23] outlier yeah
[06:52:27] yeah but in general yeah that that that
[06:52:29] statement like stuck with me in that
[06:52:31] article
[06:52:33] yeah because it reminds you at the end
[06:52:34] of the day like they they will do
[06:52:36] whatever they want no matter
[06:52:38] what and they
[06:52:41] can I mean I've been say like this is
[06:52:43] another thing I've been saying like a
[06:52:45] lot of other games will have like a like
[06:52:47] a Dev that like talks to the community a
[06:52:49] little bit I'm saying we need a John
[06:52:51] impact John genin and John impact and he
[06:52:54] just like pretends he like he like he
[06:52:56] listens to us a little he talks hey this
[06:52:58] is what we're doing and like pretends to
[06:52:59] care and then we're like oh I love John
[06:53:01] gon I love John get and like reassures
[06:53:02] us like oh we're being heard that's what
[06:53:04] I think that's what I think need
[06:53:07] a a more dog that's what I'm saying a
[06:53:09] Ben
[06:53:11] impact but like we had um we bro impact
[06:53:15] I think was it star rail or genin stream
[06:53:17] probably star rail but there was one
[06:53:19] yeah the I think it's star rail where
[06:53:21] they like for the anniversity they like
[06:53:22] talked a little bit about like some
[06:53:24] player concerns like they talked about
[06:53:26] like leaks for the first time or like
[06:53:27] some other
[06:53:29] [ __ ] it wasn't like a full thing but it
[06:53:31] was like a little thing that was like
[06:53:33] Hey like you know this is the story is
[06:53:35] going to be like this like this is like
[06:53:37] hey like for leaks like you know we wish
[06:53:39] for the story n no and like it was like
[06:53:41] cool oh [ __ ] was I think that was St
[06:53:43] yeah I was like oh they're like
[06:53:44] listening a little like they're you know
[06:53:45] talking about
[06:53:48] that but anyways why are all my
[06:53:50] characters
[06:53:52] low I mean you just died oh de wait what
[06:53:57] the [ __ ] I just got an
[06:54:00] achievement what the
[06:54:04] you know I feel definitely closer to
[06:54:05] aesr than
[06:54:07] like as like
[06:54:10] a are you saying like Community
[06:54:12] perspective like as a player or as like
[06:54:15] as a yeah as a player
[06:54:18] commun that that is not what I said do
[06:54:21] not do not say that I I I will not be
[06:54:23] having this that is that is not that is
[06:54:25] not I let's not start
[06:54:27] that
[06:54:29] please sorry I'm not down for that when
[06:54:32] it's you you know dude bro do you
[06:54:34] understand how feral both communities
[06:54:36] are to just like have anything to use
[06:54:37] against each other like okay okay dude
[06:54:40] okay I'm going to say this till the day
[06:54:41] I die gench rewards have been dog [ __ ]
[06:54:43] and genin gets so much [ __ ] and we need
[06:54:44] more like always however dude if I swear
[06:54:48] to God if starel gets like five more
[06:54:50] pulls than genin it will literally be a
[06:54:52] riot like even if like dude dude do you
[06:54:55] see what happened for the
[06:54:56] anniversary yes we were there okay no no
[06:54:59] no but I'm saying like not not the genin
[06:55:01] one that went feral like like even on
[06:55:03] star star they were expecting like a
[06:55:04] five star and we got like 30 PS which is
[06:55:06] a lot and that's good and is better than
[06:55:07] genin but it's
[06:55:09] like like
[06:55:12] imagine nothing
[06:55:16] okay it's
[06:55:22] like why am I lagging what the
[06:55:27] [ __ ] Mountain wank it's no good run I
[06:55:30] what you saying all
[06:55:41] oh yeah it's it's it's kind of like
[06:55:43] funny watching it from the outside as
[06:55:45] someone who like really doesn't give a
[06:55:48] [ __ ] seeing how good marketing it is for
[06:55:52] Star
[06:55:53] rail oh it's amazing
[06:55:56] like the the people who had the idea to
[06:56:00] like in the [ __ ] Foo
[06:56:04] like marketing
[06:56:05] department to
[06:56:10] like give really good star whe rewards
[06:56:14] and then like hold off on giving
[06:56:17] anything for
[06:56:19] genin to pit the community against each
[06:56:22] other it like they are they're very SM
[06:56:25] they're very good at their job for sure
[06:56:28] and it's like yeah it it's it's kind
[06:56:31] easy how intentional it is dude it's so
[06:56:35] easy to like I know this is going to
[06:56:36] sound like Psychopathic to say but like
[06:56:39] I'm saying this not someone who I would
[06:56:41] like to think doesn't or tries not to do
[06:56:43] this but it's so easy to like manipulate
[06:56:45] your audience to like believe something
[06:56:47] like genuinely or parot something it's
[06:56:50] like so easy streamers be like no it's
[06:56:54] just like an echo chamber boom boom boom
[06:56:56] boom boom also streamers be like yeah if
[06:56:59] it's useful I'll take it
[06:57:05] yeah who's trying to join parasocial
[06:57:07] Club
[06:57:15] yeah yeah the biggest thing that makes
[06:57:18] me cringe as like cuz like I play both
[06:57:21] games and it's day like I I recognize
[06:57:24] they are just games to do my yeah sorry
[06:57:27] sorry I understand like people want to
[06:57:29] fight for what they think they deserve
[06:57:31] which is like completely fine as well
[06:57:34] but the moment like you start pitting
[06:57:37] yourself and other people against each
[06:57:39] other it's not you versus the company
[06:57:41] anymore you're putting yourself against
[06:57:43] other players which is just like [ __ ]
[06:57:44] idiotic to me and just cringe like I
[06:57:46] just find that so like not like
[06:57:49] productive yeah a lot of times it's
[06:57:51] Community versus Community when like
[06:57:52] also yeah imagine if people had like a
[06:57:55] tenth of the energy they have when
[06:57:58] talking about anniversary rewards when
[06:58:01] it came to literally anything that
[06:58:03] actually
[06:58:04] mattered like bro who gives the [ __ ]
[06:58:07] watch watch your wording though I'm not
[06:58:08] trying to I'm not trying to get this
[06:58:09] clipped watch or if you get 3,200 Primo
[06:58:12] gems from exploring through additional
[06:58:14] chest who cares man like give us actual
[06:58:18] quality of life give us endgame give us
[06:58:21] I mean [ __ ] more teapot [ __ ] I yeah I
[06:58:25] think okay but I good did you just ask
[06:58:27] for a more teapot I don't care like I
[06:58:30] don't care about teapot but I just want
[06:58:32] to make it like I don't mind if they
[06:58:34] make more deot content hey people like
[06:58:37] the deot I guess you do
[06:58:39] you wait what's what I don't understand
[06:58:41] the point of what you're saying here
[06:58:44] yeah it's I wish people had the same
[06:58:48] energy asking the devs to do better
[06:58:50] about making the game better as they do
[06:58:53] asking about [ __ ] premium currency
[06:58:55] and gacha games will always ask for
[06:58:57] currency first like I I get that I will
[06:59:00] say though a big thing I I've gotten
[06:59:03] with like example with like teapot is
[06:59:05] I'm a combat player I play for the
[06:59:06] combat I'm I would love if we also got
[06:59:09] content for people that don't care about
[06:59:10] cont uh combat like more story [ __ ]
[06:59:13] teapot this this this but when I ask for
[06:59:15] more content more combat more Abyss more
[06:59:17] this more that I don't want these
[06:59:18] [ __ ] being like he go play
[06:59:20] another game dude go [ __ ] yourself like
[06:59:22] I want combat because I play for combat
[06:59:24] you can want TCG I would see if I see
[06:59:27] TCG I'm not like oh why are they there
[06:59:29] TCG I'm like oh cool like the the five
[06:59:31] remaining TCG players are having fun
[06:59:32] good for them but
[06:59:34] like sometimes like yeah I don't know
[06:59:38] that brings up a really interesting like
[06:59:40] issue with
[06:59:42] like the devs deciding what to like not
[06:59:45] prioritize but like make content
[06:59:48] for cuz like one of the biggest things
[06:59:51] that people were so turned off by TCG
[06:59:55] not that it's a car game car like yeah
[06:59:57] TG great like at its core it's a pretty
[06:59:59] well made like Fast well actually I
[07:00:01] don't know the Met anymore but it's a
[07:00:02] cute like like very simple card game
[07:00:05] that like just works it just was
[07:00:07] released with not enough stuff dude
[07:00:09] there's no ranked it it's released with
[07:00:12] rewards I think that that's the issue
[07:00:14] when you like when you start releasing
[07:00:18] like game modes and things with rewards
[07:00:20] people feel obligated especially if
[07:00:21] they're free to play to need to play
[07:00:23] that to get Primo gems to progress to
[07:00:26] get the favorite characters they want
[07:00:28] and I I don't think they like balanced
[07:00:32] but you don't think it is no mean sure
[07:00:35] like that may have played a role but I
[07:00:37] think the biggest reason why TCG ended
[07:00:40] up at least in the west kind of not
[07:00:45] really picking up too much is because it
[07:00:49] was released in a state where honestly
[07:00:53] every deck ran the same cards right
[07:00:56] there was a set of like 20 good cards 30
[07:01:00] acceptable cards and the rest was
[07:01:02] complete dog [ __ ] and so every deck has
[07:01:05] had 20 of the same cards and then 10 of
[07:01:08] the 30 accept C I see where you're
[07:01:10] saying you're talking about the game
[07:01:11] like concept I I think you're too inde
[07:01:13] deep on The Meta though like I think
[07:01:15] even if the meta about yeah like
[07:01:19] marketing any game mode is what about
[07:01:21] like I think even if the meta was like
[07:01:22] heaven on Earth and it was super fun if
[07:01:25] there's no rank system I am not like
[07:01:27] what the [ __ ] am I going to do like what
[07:01:28] am I playing for for enjoyment I don't
[07:01:31] have look at me I'm playing
[07:01:33] genin what animal are those I don't know
[07:01:36] Su Beast I think but it's like I feel
[07:01:40] like yeah like that's all true but it's
[07:01:41] like there needs to be a reason to keep
[07:01:43] playing and like you could argue of
[07:01:45] rewards but it's like the thing is is
[07:01:47] like well like as you're saying I guess
[07:01:48] it's like I need like something to work
[07:01:51] towards like I you know make it
[07:01:52] competitive like I'm not playing casual
[07:01:54] Hearthstone unranked like I'm not like
[07:01:56] I'm not like it's not happening but I
[07:01:58] have thousands of hours in Hearthstone
[07:01:59] or like at least yeah thousands
[07:02:02] but I played maybe two casual games in
[07:02:03] my
[07:02:05] life that's true in high school I'd
[07:02:08] always ask Nick yo you want to one V1 in
[07:02:10] Hearthstone and he'd always be like [ __ ]
[07:02:12] you I you're not my friend I didn't say
[07:02:15] [ __ ] you but
[07:02:17] okay and then Q rank game yeah but you
[07:02:20] spected
[07:02:22] me yeah okay no I get that I only Q
[07:02:25] ranked when I played Valor I would only
[07:02:27] Q
[07:02:28] ranked I like I I I don't want to play
[07:02:31] like
[07:02:33] I mean five Stacks are fun I I become
[07:02:35] much more relaxed nowadays cuz I just
[07:02:36] don't play R anymore but if I were get
[07:02:38] into it I'm just someone in chat said
[07:02:40] stop the capital bro you never hit
[07:02:42] Legend should I link them your hand lock
[07:02:46] don't link it yet don't link it yet but
[07:02:48] yeah know I was I was Legend I was top
[07:02:52] 50 but anyways
[07:02:55] um yeah I don't know I don't like talk
[07:02:59] like the thing is it's hard to talk
[07:03:00] about these things cuz it's like I
[07:03:01] always big picture like yeah I want more
[07:03:03] rewards obviously like obviously but
[07:03:04] it's like I'm I'm thinking like you
[07:03:06] could give me Primos today and I'll be
[07:03:08] happy but like I want something to do
[07:03:10] like I want like end game like I want
[07:03:11] something and it's like but you can't
[07:03:13] talk about like currency is always going
[07:03:16] to be like the the main thing so it's
[07:03:17] like you need that first and then it's
[07:03:18] like the other stuff not cuz that's
[07:03:20] necessarily more important but it's like
[07:03:22] if there's not that people will be like
[07:03:23] well I need that dude I kind of wish I
[07:03:25] cared more about the currency it just
[07:03:28] yeah well you also are happy with the
[07:03:29] characters you have but like I know like
[07:03:31] as a casual gotra player in a lot of
[07:03:33] like I don't play that many goas but in
[07:03:34] the gotas I do play it's like I just
[07:03:36] want the character I like like that's
[07:03:37] the first thing before I even look at
[07:03:39] the game well that's not true but like
[07:03:40] before I even look at like the content
[07:03:43] like start doing the other stuff it's
[07:03:44] like okay I want this new [ __ ] Cookie
[07:03:46] Run cookie I want this new [ __ ]
[07:03:49] like right I mean that that's the core
[07:03:51] of gacha games and then then and because
[07:03:53] of that you're right it's the currency
[07:03:55] that matters first yeah like that's
[07:03:56] that's that's what shows up like I don't
[07:03:58] think never just had that
[07:04:02] bra like I've never had that me neither
[07:04:05] but like that's what the gacha game will
[07:04:08] bring like
[07:04:09] that's you know like that's what like
[07:04:12] you will get when you're playing a gacha
[07:04:14] game for the most part because it's like
[07:04:17] like you don't really like you don't
[07:04:18] [ __ ] spend money anymore right Z like
[07:04:20] on genin you don't I haven't spent money
[07:04:22] on genin in like three years yeah yeah
[07:04:24] so like if you want a character you'll
[07:04:25] save up get them I get that but it's
[07:04:27] like a lot of people like been saving up
[07:04:30] for like I have 100,000 free what am I
[07:04:33] going to do with that [ __ ] man yeah but
[07:04:35] like you're a very rare breed of not
[07:04:38] spending like I'm not saying not
[07:04:40] spending I'm saying of nons Spenders
[07:04:41] you're a rare breed wait really yeah he
[07:04:44] has 100K Primos just like chilling I
[07:04:46] think it's said like 90k cuz I I I I had
[07:04:48] to dig a little to get CH
[07:04:51] and [ __ ] yeah I think he like I mean
[07:04:55] yeah but you also have like an R2 fonia
[07:04:58] sword so you know [ __ ] you it's r to be
[07:05:02] fair but but yeah like I remember when I
[07:05:04] started playing this game like I was
[07:05:06] like I I I spent
[07:05:08] um Wanted offishal on the venty banner
[07:05:11] yeah that's how I start that's how I
[07:05:12] spent for the first time but I remember
[07:05:14] I think you said Z like either when I
[07:05:16] spent or when you spent you're like one
[07:05:18] of us spent 60 and you're were like I
[07:05:20] would like I'm enjoying the game I'd be
[07:05:22] happy spending $60 for like a retail
[07:05:24] game so like I'm fine with
[07:05:26] this yeah I think I mean I was a very
[07:05:29] naive well yeah like that's a like 3
[07:05:32] years ago but I'm saying a lot of people
[07:05:34] will like like even when I started
[07:05:35] playing it's like years ago I need this
[07:05:37] character like I looked up the character
[07:05:39] list before I started playing like
[07:05:40] that's what got me to play I'm like okay
[07:05:42] I want Fel I want sh I want duuke oh
[07:05:44] need
[07:05:46] there I don't know to those who want
[07:05:50] endless content do you replay combat
[07:05:52] events no even if you did it get super
[07:05:54] still super fast you do know that like
[07:05:57] that's because those combat events are
[07:05:58] not designed to be replayed dude the
[07:06:01] combat events they're like sick but then
[07:06:03] they
[07:06:05] stop like you know that they can design
[07:06:08] content that is meant to be replayed
[07:06:11] right recent one was ass I don't
[07:06:13] remember what the recent one was to be
[07:06:15] honest uh the recent one was like the
[07:06:17] picture one where things pause oh yeah
[07:06:19] that's cringe that was dog [ __ ] yeah
[07:06:22] yeah that's
[07:06:25] cringe I watched a video essay about how
[07:06:28] genin released like a simulated Universe
[07:06:30] event and then disappeared it I mean you
[07:06:32] talked about this to the [ __ ]
[07:06:35] Labyrinth yeah but like in in Star
[07:06:37] Royale like I don't really play much
[07:06:40] star anymore but like when I did most of
[07:06:44] my gameplay was just redoing more golden
[07:06:48] gears and
[07:06:49] swarm no that's literally what I do like
[07:06:51] I'll Auto Battle off stream and then
[07:06:52] when I stream like when I want to like
[07:06:53] have fun I'll do like golden gears or
[07:06:55] swarm or like yeah and like the reason I
[07:06:57] got tired of it is because I just don't
[07:06:59] like the starwell combat system very
[07:07:01] much
[07:07:02] much not because it wasn't fun yeah know
[07:07:06] it's good
[07:07:07] yeah I mean
[07:07:12] yeah
[07:07:16] yeah I don't
[07:07:19] know what do you think
[07:07:22] Jake sorry what I was editing all right
[07:07:25] bet wait recap we wnd uh I don't
[07:07:29] know uh playable game Mode's cool
[07:07:33] POG I think replayable game modes are
[07:07:37] good I agree um
[07:07:42] mihoyo pretty very sparingly when giving
[07:07:46] that type of content
[07:07:48] yeah I always feel weird talking about
[07:07:51] like new [ __ ] though cuz it's like I
[07:07:52] feel like if you talk about like content
[07:07:54] you want but you don't talk about Primos
[07:07:55] like people get mad at you so it's like
[07:07:57] I kind of try to like Circle back to
[07:07:58] yeah we also want Primos but it's like
[07:08:00] um no
[07:08:02] I think it's okay to talk about get mad
[07:08:05] how you want to enjoy the game I maybe I
[07:08:06] just get one guy but yeah yeah I think
[07:08:08] you just get I literally never had
[07:08:10] anyone like get mad at me because I
[07:08:12] didn't ask for people think think about
[07:08:14] it like this it's the wrong person
[07:08:16] caring about like someone else's like
[07:08:19] enjoyment like who who's going to like
[07:08:21] [ __ ] on you for the way you want to
[07:08:23] enjoy like you're not [ __ ] on them
[07:08:26] but they're [ __ ] on you so it's like
[07:08:28] don't give them like your day of time
[07:08:30] right like
[07:08:32] you've done nothing wrong yeah you're
[07:08:34] just talking about things you
[07:08:37] enjoy
[07:08:39] there's also the thing about like
[07:08:43] okay uh day of
[07:08:46] time the thing about resin 2 is uh this
[07:08:50] might be a take I saw from usage I can't
[07:08:52] remember but the the [ __ ] the thing
[07:08:55] about resin too is like obviously I want
[07:08:57] more resin but like the reason I can't I
[07:08:59] don't complain about it that much is cuz
[07:09:00] like what the [ __ ] else is there to do
[07:09:02] imagine you just get every artifact
[07:09:04] unlimited resin I'm quitting the game
[07:09:06] bro like yeah like you get unlimited
[07:09:09] resin it's going to be fun for like two
[07:09:12] or three weeks but the game doesn't have
[07:09:16] a meaningful form of progression past
[07:09:19] artifacts so okay you've got great
[07:09:21] artifacts now
[07:09:23] what like yeah more resin would be great
[07:09:26] but they also need to add something else
[07:09:28] to go with it otherwise it's just not
[07:09:30] going to solve any of the actual
[07:09:31] underlying
[07:09:32] issues yeah but do you know what solves
[07:09:35] literally every underlying issue arino
[07:09:38] baby I think what solves every
[07:09:40] underlying issue is using your Twitch
[07:09:42] Prime don't forget to use your Twitch
[07:09:44] Prime
[07:09:45] chat this episode of the podcast is
[07:09:47] sponsored
[07:09:59] by what a pleasant surprise truly an
[07:10:03] extra slice of
[07:10:05] Joy I mean yeah like like obviously chat
[07:10:07] obviously it should be like [ __ ] 240
[07:10:09] like start like you know obviously but
[07:10:11] like you get what I'm saying or what
[07:10:13] we're saying it's like obviously more is
[07:10:16] like yes please but like at a certain
[07:10:18] point it's
[07:10:21] um I would I think Priority One is like
[07:10:24] content and then priority two is yeah
[07:10:28] yeah yeah top
[07:10:33] I want more pin variations
[07:10:39] true like pins you know there's like six
[07:10:42] or I can't count
[07:10:48] seven seven like my favorite boy group
[07:10:51] BTS jimn junkook RM Jinn Suga V and J
[07:10:58] hope all right my bad
[07:11:02] you know what they need to realize
[07:11:03] though they need to realize that you
[07:11:05] can't have more oculi on the map than
[07:11:07] there is a pin limit that doesn't work
[07:11:10] that's stupid as [ __ ] wait what did he
[07:11:11] say what did he say they can't have a
[07:11:14] pit limit that's lower than the amount
[07:11:16] of oculi on the map oh yeah dude okay
[07:11:19] you know how you know how like you're
[07:11:21] watching like Kon right he's like
[07:11:22] welcome we're gonna we're gonna pick
[07:11:24] every flower okay Bet and then he like
[07:11:26] has a pin for every flower does he have
[07:11:28] to delete each one between each video
[07:11:30] cuz he runs out of pins that's
[07:11:34] [ __ ] poor
[07:11:38] guy better a shed a tear for my
[07:11:45] goat someone said pin presets okay maybe
[07:11:48] not that
[07:11:52] far I don't know about pin
[07:11:55] presets ooh it'd actually be cool if you
[07:11:57] could import pins like you can like
[07:11:59] export your pins and then someone can
[07:12:00] copy past the
[07:12:02] code that would actually be kind of cool
[07:12:04] dude I'm telling you every old school

[07:22:17] fun all the slurs I know I learned on Le
[07:22:22] I mean
[07:22:24] yeah dude un ironically I would not be
[07:22:27] the person I am today without Le I don't
[07:22:28] even know if I'd be able to speak
[07:22:29] English oh are you yo are you whoa I all
[07:22:34] I learned to speak English because I
[07:22:37] needed to learn how to Flame my
[07:22:38] teammates okay I don't know if I would
[07:22:40] be fluent in English if it wasn't for
[07:22:42] League of Legends okay but like that's
[07:22:44] not a good thing I
[07:22:48] know I mean being fluent in English is
[07:22:50] good it's being because of League of
[07:22:52] Legends is
[07:22:54] bad but I can't change
[07:22:57] that colloquial I mean yeah it was F I
[07:23:00] don't know I'm just being a hater I
[07:23:02] don't really care that word is wild wild
[07:23:05] colloquial like it's like it's like a
[07:23:08] jargon but like more like chill I
[07:23:13] see an interesting concept def stra
[07:23:18] greater than greater than greater
[07:23:21] than it's kind of a [ __ ] word honestly
[07:23:23] yeah that's a terrible word
[07:23:33] you want to know what a really
[07:23:34] underrated word in English is how do we
[07:23:37] end up here in the
[07:23:39] conversation gays like G a z e that's
[07:23:44] not even I I feel like gay is mainstream
[07:23:47] now like the okay this sounds I know I
[07:23:49] know but it's like people don't people
[07:23:51] don't appreciate it for what it is like
[07:23:53] in French the closest thing you have is
[07:23:55] like and it just doesn't yeah we don't
[07:23:57] have okay I can't say G like I'm Gaye g
[07:24:01] a z e we don't have that word in French
[07:24:03] yeah like the closest thing is is like
[07:24:05] right yeah it's not even that doesn't
[07:24:07] and yeah like it just doesn't hit the
[07:24:09] same you know and I feel like English
[07:24:10] speakers sometimes don't realize how
[07:24:13] privileged they are to have how
[07:24:15] privileged they
[07:24:17] are that's that's crazy okay I do think
[07:24:21] language though like you can't think
[07:24:23] certain things with when you're confined
[07:24:25] with certain languages like some words
[07:24:28] are like even expressing certain like
[07:24:29] emotions or like feelings bundled in a
[07:24:32] word that some languages don't have it's
[07:24:35] so like contextual like other languages
[07:24:37] but then English is like you have like
[07:24:40] so many things for so many different
[07:24:42] like things inside thing it's like
[07:24:44] threads inside things and
[07:24:47] things yeah what the [ __ ] is blue blue

[08:25:16] even need like a a Vermilion set it
[08:25:18] doesn't matter no one's going to be like
[08:25:20] wow your show is so good now no one
[08:25:22] cares no one cares like why am I here
[08:25:25] what's the end game also I hope they
[08:25:27] don't add Vermilion I hope cuz if they
[08:25:31] add Vermillion to the strong box then
[08:25:32] it's efficient to farm but if they don't
[08:25:35] and then that means I wasted like 100k
[08:25:37] resin here but if they don't add it then
[08:25:39] this was a smart investment does that
[08:25:41] make sense does that make sense like
[08:25:43] this is you know like the Boomers that
[08:25:44] are like hell yeah brother I had to work
[08:25:46] six jobs to go to school so you should
[08:25:49] too and then they don't want you to have
[08:25:51] like free tuition okay that's literally
[08:25:53] how I feel but with Vermilion like I I
[08:25:56] I'm the I'm the Vermilion gatekeeper if
[08:25:59] I had to spend 100,000 resin here so do
[08:26:02] you you need your money to refresh for
[08:26:04] Vermillion dude [ __ ] youday I was
[08:26:06] watching Tyler One play an EU right cuz
[08:26:07] he's an EU right now I was watching it
[08:26:09] cuz I he's my guilty pleasure anyways
[08:26:11] and I was watching it and then I was
[08:26:13] like he said a quot he said a a sentence
[08:26:15] he said I just realized people come and
[08:26:17] watch me to be miserable no one's here
[08:26:19] watching a happy stream and I'm going to
[08:26:21] be honest I feel the same way with me
[08:26:23] farming Vermilion why is this idiot
[08:26:25] doing Vermilion again again okay would I
[08:26:27] really am I an idiot after if I get a
[08:26:29] good artifact no that's a good
[08:26:31] investment so you're judging my
[08:26:32] intellect based on my luck if I get
[08:26:35] lucky it was smart if I get unlucky it
[08:26:38] was unsmart Z I used to follow your
[08:26:40] guides and then I watched your stream
[08:26:42] saw you die to a hilly turle and now I
[08:26:44] can't trust anything you say you told me
[08:26:46] not to farm Vermillion I tuned into your
[08:26:48] Liv stream and you farm Vermillion
[08:26:49] please explain how this is reasonable
[08:26:51] and sane Behavior do I look sane was the
[08:26:54] most efficient domain to farming okay so
[08:26:57] the thing with Vermilion Hereafter right
[08:26:58] wait did I just spend a th000 res on
[08:27:00] Vermillion and get nothing why are you
[08:27:01] farming Vermillion watch this you're
[08:27:03] going to call it w million after this W
[08:27:06] or
[08:27:07] million wor million watch this boom [ __ ]
[08:27:13] boom I found a Wikipedia page that
[08:27:16] summarizes the Vermilion domain
[08:27:18] perfectly five stages of grief anger why
[08:27:21] me it's not fair okay I may have said
[08:27:23] that bargaining examples include the
[08:27:25] terminy ill terminally ill person who
[08:27:27] negotiates with God
[08:27:29] to okay it's not to that stage like
[08:27:31] that's just that that's not me
[08:27:33] depression
[08:27:35] I'm what's the point I'm so sorry I
[08:27:38] could give you a good artifact or you
[08:27:42] could double it up and give it to the
[08:27:45] next person I step away from Vermilion
[08:27:47] for one second the better the person you
[08:27:50] are the worst the artifact you get true
[08:27:52] so unfortunately I've just been getting
[08:27:55] [ __ ] on artifact luck recently cuz I'm
[08:27:56] such a good person I must be a saint

[08:48:20] of the night they get out of bed to get
[08:48:22] some water but they notice there's no

[08:48:29] able to go back to sleep cuz I need to B

[08:48:31] and I'm the hydrated so they walk up to
[08:48:33] go get water in the middle of the night
[08:48:34] half asleep but then they step on a Lego
[08:48:36] and then it triggers the neurons in
[08:48:37] their brain it hurts their foot and now
[08:48:39] they probably can't go back to sleep and
[08:48:41] then just as they get back to their
[08:48:43] tiredness and forget about the Lego
[08:48:44] incident they realize they have to pee

[08:51:46] damage if that is a bad de I don't know
[08:51:49] what a good one looks like like
[08:51:50] obviously it could be better I I I even
[08:51:52] have a better build like this is even my
[08:51:54] best build
[08:51:55] I'm just saying like and yes you could
[08:51:57] be level 90 it gives you more HP and HP
[08:51:59] is nice and some people are like oh why
[08:52:00] is your HP low crit is better de are
[08:52:02] cleaning the teapot because that's how

[08:52:06] is fine like you can play her in monop
[08:52:09] pyro wait I Dro why did you zoom in 18K
[08:52:13] damage bro
[08:52:15] why you actually made de look good if
[08:52:18] she's bad explain this damage
[08:52:25] look at this look at this look at yeah
[08:52:27] look at
[08:52:28] yeah cuz you can't jump the only problem
[08:52:31] is that you can do this and then just
[08:52:32] not swap into de and it's like basically
[08:52:35] the same damage yeah you can jump cancel
[08:52:36] her burst pretty well so if you use her
[08:52:38] burst and then you Auto attack and you
[08:52:39] jump de is you know obviously you can
[08:52:41] Vapor using hydro supports right so what
[08:52:43] you can do is like cro burst yolon burst
[08:52:46] and then you use her burst and now watch
[08:52:52] this dude they don't work they don't
[08:52:55] [ __ ] fire water arrows let's say you
[08:52:57] want to play her hyper carry you know
[08:52:58] you're like oh my God I love her I want
[08:52:59] a hyper carry with her okay watch this
[08:53:02] so we're going to Ben it we're going to
[08:53:03] swirl the Pyro we're going to Mona
[08:53:06] burst we're going to do that wait wrong
[08:53:08] character you for
[08:53:14] it okay and you don't kill the room
[08:53:16] guard holy [ __ ] de's burst does no
[08:53:21] damage they is a good character if you
[08:53:24] don't have have like access to the
[08:53:25] internet dead
[08:53:28] meat you're dead meat if I'm being fair
[08:53:31] okay as a fair as a fair person I would
[08:53:34] put de probably somewhere around like
[08:53:36] here add DEA C6 R5 what is that an emote
[08:53:39] what is
[08:53:40] this
[08:53:42] wait they like AO if ao's skill did only
[08:53:46] counted as skill damage and wouldn't
[08:53:48] proc any support character but also he
[08:53:50] had less damage and also it didn't apply
[08:53:52] Hydro wait
[08:53:57] why am I not
[08:53:59] burining the hit box is too high it's
[08:54:02] de's birthday okay if they don't buff
[08:54:04] her they actually hate her dude okay for
[08:54:07] okay for de's birthday come on come on
[08:54:09] for de's birthday we decided she could
[08:54:11] kill a hilly Turtle for de's birthday we
[08:54:13] decided hey you know what you can kill a
[08:54:16] run guard you're such a good person
[08:54:17] compliment Dia she is definitely uh a
[08:54:20] defensive like she definitely gives you
[08:54:22] utility defensively so let's say you're
[08:54:25] like hey man I really want a shield but
[08:54:27] it's too stressful to have a shield
[08:54:28] because what if it breaks you can use d
[08:54:30] e she is
[08:54:32] arguably no I would say without a doubt
[08:54:34] she's the best Claymore pyro character
[08:54:37] we've gotten for the standard banners
[08:54:38] since sumaru came out she is probably
[08:54:41] top four characters um in my party right
[08:54:44] now yeah so we scoll pyro we apply cryo
[08:54:46] then we get that in the COO burst so
[08:54:47] that we can melt then look at this dead
[08:54:49] damage we just B it first and then
[08:54:56] if that wasn't me then explain this
[08:54:58] explain this explain this rotation right
[08:55:00] now explain this explain this explain
[08:55:01] how my D is going to do this much damage
[08:55:03] it's literally not even going to be
[08:55:04] fathomable how much damage my D is going
[08:55:06] to do when I swap into one sec watch
[08:55:08] this watch this wait let me get my D let
[08:55:09] me get my DST watch
[08:55:15] this see yeah de's like Dory if Dory
[08:55:18] didn't heal but also if instead of
[08:55:20] applying the element every point4
[08:55:22] seconds it was every 2.5 seconds then de
[08:55:27] burst you need to do sound effects for
[08:55:29] more damage is she better than
[08:55:33] CLE Mod's bad
[08:55:36] listen someone someone or me commenting
[08:55:38] on a character's power level in The Meta
[08:55:41] should not affect you if you just want
[08:55:43] the character or like how they play like
[08:55:44] [ __ ] play who you want no one's going
[08:55:46] to be like oh my God don't pull for them
[08:55:47] like [ __ ] get who you
[08:55:49] want waa
[08:55:51] 195,000 oh my God D you just don't know
[08:55:54] how to play her you just don't know how
[08:55:56] to play her you just don't know how to

[08:56:14] funny that's not funny I've learned from
[08:56:15] my mistake like you don't have to defend
[08:56:17] a [ __ ] character just cuz you like
[08:56:18] them like you can accept what they are
[08:56:20] and they're like dude K Ching Mains for
[08:56:22] the first 2 years before dend came out
[08:56:24] they were like not like all of them

[08:57:18] female Claymore character on your team

[10:12:12] from version 4.6 I've heard that
[10:12:15] Travelers will be experiencing new
[10:12:17] content related to the house of the
[10:12:18] Hearth in the upcoming version Erin why
[10:12:21] don't you give us a rundown on what sort
[10:12:22] of organization The House of the Hearth
[10:12:24] is yes it would be my pleasure actually
[10:12:26] yeah on the most recent intelligence
[10:12:29] reports The House of the Hearth is a
[10:12:30] fouille intelligence organization
[10:12:33] operated by the Nave uh it takes in
[10:12:36] children who no longer have a home due
[10:12:37] to all manner of reasons and they
[10:12:40] receive an education in a variety of
[10:12:42] disciplines naturally at the same time
[10:12:44] as it provides a home the children also
[10:12:47] take on various responsibilities okay
[10:12:49] okay this sounds like everything that we
[10:12:51] already know from the game uh is there
[10:12:53] more news to hear yes everyone knows
[10:12:55] that the house of the Hearth is a rather
[10:12:57] complicated orphanage and the Nave the
[10:12:59] fourth harbinger of the fouille is still
[10:13:02] hiding many Unsolved Mysteries so how
[10:13:06] about we start diving into all the new
[10:13:08] information that we have about our Lino
[10:13:11] let's do it yes let's do it okay okay
[10:13:13] first I want to hear it straight from
[10:13:16] y'all what kind of person do you think
[10:13:18] the Navy is oh no oh my gosh I'm feeling
[10:13:21] a lot of pressure right now for the
[10:13:23] blind the na is is vision for the deaf
[10:13:27] she ising for the I noticed that arino
[10:13:30] was really skilled at directing the
[10:13:32] conversation her way of speaking was
[10:13:34] incredibly refined and polite but she
[10:13:37] was also incredibly
[10:13:38] intimidating I mean remember how finina
[10:13:41] pretended not to recognize her and
[10:13:43] talked about having nightmares I totally
[10:13:45] get where she was coming from but that's
[10:13:48] just an Outsiders point of view right
[10:13:50] what is the Nave like as a parent I
[10:13:52] think Damon is probably the best person
[10:13:54] to answer that question okay take it
[10:13:56] away okay you were hoping that I would
[10:13:58] be the weakest link well she's a very
[10:14:03] strict father okay uhoh can believe this
[10:14:06] guy's blade um like insane all right it
[10:14:08] sounds like she gives everyone an
[10:14:10] intimidating impression yeah but I think
[10:14:12] our leino loves all of the House's
[10:14:14] children equally and she would never
[10:14:16] treat them harshly for no reason though
[10:14:18] the kid kids feel a lot of pressure
[10:14:19] during her lessons and are often scared
[10:14:21] speechless by her Stern attitude it's
[10:14:24] probably for their own good in an
[10:14:26] organization like the foule these kids
[10:14:28] actually need to be more mature it's
[10:14:30] find the guy that wrote
[10:14:32] who you know that's actually kind of sad
[10:14:36] though isn't it it
[10:14:39] is you're I
[10:14:45] hello dude I
[10:14:50] like actually
[10:14:53] hello okay we're fine we're fine are you
[10:14:57] trying to say that she treats the kids
[10:14:58] like that because she was traumatized o
[10:15:01] wait no I have a whale internet my PC is
[10:15:03] kind of SC I have a whale internet our
[10:15:05] Lino Secrets hidden for just a little
[10:15:07] bit longer okay okay um I do have a
[10:15:10] question though why did the children
[10:15:12] call her father the twitch my well if
[10:15:14] you're curious about aro's past then
[10:15:17] you'll have to find your answer in the
[10:15:19] game that's her story Quest ignis
[10:15:22] purgatorius will be released with
[10:15:23] version 4.6 we're definitely doing that
[10:15:25] not coping we're actually doing that
[10:15:27] gameplay experience by saying too much
[10:15:28] about her Quest okay but I do hope that
[10:15:31] Travelers will be able to appreciate AR
[10:15:33] Lino's unique charm after they've
[10:15:35] experienced her entire story yeah
[10:15:38] version 4.6 will also introduce a new
[10:15:41] feature the focused experience mode now
[10:15:44] if you use the feature while playing AR
[10:15:45] Lino's story Quest then it will minimize
[10:15:48] the number of times that you'll be
[10:15:49] interrupted by characters or quest
[10:15:51] locations being allocated to other
[10:15:53] quests so hopefully this mode will help
[10:15:55] Travelers have a better story experience
[10:15:57] you know nice that's right and in the
[10:16:00] future this function will become
[10:16:01] available for more and more quests
[10:16:03] besides the story Quest I'm also looking
[10:16:06] hearing the no
[10:16:08] longed awesome we'll finally be able to
[10:16:11] hear what she thinks about the other
[10:16:12] harbingers too yes I selfishly also
[10:16:14] think that will be cool yes so next
[10:16:18] let's let's take a look at aro's elegant
[10:16:20] yet deadly fighting style ooh Intrigue
[10:16:26] yeah staring into my eyes is still
[10:16:29] advised I can't promise you'll like what
[10:16:32] you see okay I saw that no point acting
[10:16:35] I did see the chair a sick
[10:16:40] chair
[10:16:42] bro is that not a [ __ ] scythe and a
[10:16:45] wing by the
[10:16:47] way he has a [ __ ] wing and a
[10:16:52] s this is where you
[10:17:01] fall I like how she Glides yes yes yeah
[10:17:05] she's very elegant like that was a
[10:17:07] perfect descriptor like elegant but
[10:17:09] deadly like a like a ballerina of death
[10:17:12] yes everything she does is so effortless
[10:17:14] I know right yes all right well so I
[10:17:17] hadn't seen her animations but I knew
[10:17:19] then we're going to have to talk about
[10:17:21] the bond of
[10:17:22] life you might have been a victim to it
[10:17:25] while you were fighting Elite fouille
[10:17:26] operative in fontain does anyone still
[10:17:29] remember what a bond of life is what the
[10:17:32] [ __ ] oh are you going to be teaching us
[10:17:33] about her abilities guys you're too loud
[10:17:36] pip down s let's listen to what she has
[10:17:39] to say wait I I think I remember it's
[10:17:43] the red portion of the
[10:17:44] H you have a bond of Life active it'll
[10:17:47] absorb any healing that character
[10:17:49] receives so they can't regain HP Bond of
[10:17:53] Life value yeah there's Bond of Life on
[10:17:54] like font weapons right now so I used
[10:17:57] student when arino has a bond of Life
[10:18:00] greater than or equal to a certain
[10:18:03] percentage of her health bar her normal
[10:18:05] charged and plunging attacks will be
[10:18:07] converted to pyro damage are so sick be
[10:18:10] overridden by other Elemental infusions
[10:18:13] and while she's in this state her normal
[10:18:16] attacks will consume a portion of her
[10:18:18] current Bond life to deal more damage
[10:18:20] and reduce the remaining cool down on
[10:18:23] her Elemental skill okay whoa whoa wait
[10:18:26] wait wait a it's a lot it's a lot so
[10:18:28] you're saying that she'll deal damage
[10:18:30] with her normal attack when her bond of
[10:18:32] life is higher put simply yes whoa whoa
[10:18:36] whoa wait a second no wait I get it wait
[10:18:40] so arino can give herself a bond of life
[10:18:43] right yeah I I think so I mean otherwise
[10:18:45] she'd have to chase down enemies who can
[10:18:47] put a bond of Life on her actually that
[10:18:50] that sounds kind of funny I'd like to
[10:18:52] see that uh and that brings us to our
[10:18:54] Elemental skill dude this character is
[10:18:56] [ __ ] doesn't just damage enemies it
[10:18:59] also applies a blood debt directive to
[10:19:01] any enemy that it hits which will damage
[10:19:04] them periodically and when she uses a
[10:19:07] Charged attack or her Elemental burst
[10:19:09] she'll absorb nearby blood debt
[10:19:11] directives this her to obtain a bond of
[10:19:15] life based on the number of directives
[10:19:17] that she absorbed so don't worry Max I
[10:19:20] was very concerned I know you I don't
[10:19:22] want to them but the pole arm turned
[10:19:23] into a if you didn't see it was on her
[10:19:25] back as a PO arm removed right so how
[10:19:28] does she stay in the fight well after
[10:19:30] dishing out damage AR Lino's Elemental
[10:19:33] burst will reset the cooldown of her
[10:19:35] Elemental skill and heal her based on
[10:19:37] her attack and her current Bond of life
[10:19:40] also thanks to one of her talents while
[10:19:42] arlino is in combat she gains bonus pyro
[10:19:46] damage but also cannot be affected by
[10:19:48] any healing effects other than the
[10:19:49] healing provided by her burst oh so that
[10:19:54] seems like she's as rud she heal like
[10:19:57] she needs therapy
[10:20:00] probably she's kind of a Savage I
[10:20:04] mean um right so arino even has a
[10:20:07] special kind of movement whenever she
[10:20:09] uses her charged attack right ooh that
[10:20:11] looks perfect for scaring your enemies
[10:20:13] yes yeah and for putting some serious
[10:20:16] pressure on them wait how long does that
[10:20:17] [ __ ] last
[10:20:19] what the [ __ ] just float over the entire

[10:20:57] weekly boss that's right we were just
[10:21:01] talking about how the Nave shows
[10:21:03] different faces to her family members
[10:21:05] and to Outsiders but in special
[10:21:08] circumstances she where's finina oh yeah

[10:21:49] and then they're like oh well she's not
[10:21:51] playable also what the [ __ ] is yo what
[10:21:54] is that
[10:21:56] outfit let me pull for that outfit
[10:22:00] please you will make so much money
[10:22:02] Hoover
[10:22:04] [Music]
[10:22:11] [Music]
[10:22:13] please is that [ __ ] taboo from
[10:22:16] [ __ ] Smash 4
[10:22:20] you know who I'm talking dude what the
[10:22:22] [ __ ] was that not even Linny and fremin
[10:22:24] have seen this side of her before so the
[10:22:27] Nave is accepting oh it's from bra never
[10:22:29] mind not s for my bad gosh she's so
[10:22:31] elegant but also super duper
[10:22:34] dangerous that feels even more badass
[10:22:38] with twice the
[10:22:41] badassitude it's not so simple to see
[10:22:43] the nave's other side she'll appear
[10:22:45] normally at first as if she were giving
[10:22:48] you an ordinary training lesson waiting
[10:22:50] to counter your attack the hell is she
[10:22:51] it seems like she'll Dodge all of our
[10:22:53] attacks yo what is this team call by the
[10:22:55] way her immediate range Ian I guess okay
[10:22:57] lower mind she's implying that we're all
[10:22:59] in hand I mean you guys know what her
[10:23:02] personality is like she doesn't want her
[10:23:04] children crying or running away from
[10:23:06] conflict instead she hopes that they'll
[10:23:09] be able to take the initiative was an
[10:23:11] Ender is their own father world not show
[10:23:15] her children mercy so neither can she
[10:23:17] afford to be too forgiving to them if
[10:23:20] you do not repay the blood debt
[10:23:22] directives the Nave applies to you all
[10:23:24] her attacks against you will be enhanced
[10:23:26] but if you manage to out heal the bond
[10:23:30] of Life the Nave will reward you for
[10:23:32] repaying this blood debt and your
[10:23:33] charged attacks against her will be
[10:23:36] enhanced okay what the [ __ ] was that her
[10:23:39] back look like SP y she just yes yes
[10:23:42] that's it oh my gosh it's like she has

[10:24:05] Travelers will be wondering about this

[10:24:11] progress the story to a certain point in
[10:24:13] order to participate in the challenge
[10:24:15] but now we have a quick challenge
[10:24:19] bosses as long as Travelers are

[10:36:02] surveillance zone for a short period of
[10:36:04] time now they will be automatically
[10:36:06] freed after their timeout but also their
[10:36:08] friends can try to help them Escape The
[10:36:10] Zone early but if you get sent to jail
[10:36:13] twice you're permanently deleted from
[10:36:15] the game oh that does sound tense and
[10:36:18] thrilling right and that's not all oh no
[10:36:21] each round will have six signaling
[10:36:23] devices which will PR said I'm terrible
[10:36:25] at everything which is not true but I'll
[10:36:26] let it slide the Rebel's goal is to
[10:36:29] repair these devices while also avoiding
[10:36:31] capture once they repair four devices
[10:36:34] they win the match oh and Rebels can
[10:36:36] work together to repair these devices
[10:36:39] and hunters will either need to prevent
[10:36:41] the rebels from repairing the signaling
[10:36:42] devices or they can simply eliminate
[10:36:45] their opponents wow if you team up with
[10:36:47] friends then watching these games should
[10:36:49] be a blast ah she gets it she gets it
[10:36:52] but the next part is even more thrilling
[10:36:54] yeah when fixing a signaling device the
[10:36:57] device being repaired will enter the
[10:36:59] highspeed signaling State what does it
[10:37:01] mean it means it'll give off a light
[10:37:03] visible by every player in the area in
[10:37:06] fact the device will even be marked on
[10:37:07] the mini map ooh okay so that means that
[10:37:11] repairing the devices will expose your
[10:37:13] location oh my gosh it's these sort of
[10:37:16] unexpected risks that can be the most
[10:37:18] nerve-wracking this going to be super
[10:37:20] interesting to play yeah yeah oh
[10:37:22] absolutely and in another event
[10:37:24] Travelers will receive a rather
[10:37:27] strange what do you mean rather strange
[10:37:31] whatever what I mean is there's a chef
[10:37:33] who's famous for using unusual
[10:37:35] ingredients and he wants to make
[10:37:39] friends huh oh yeah and not just a pyro
[10:37:42] Regis fine he also wants to befriend a
[10:37:45] primo geov visha and and a jade plume
[10:37:48] Terror shroom and the millennial Pearl
[10:37:52] seahorse H you guys heard me the first
[10:37:55] time yeah I thought you would react this
[10:37:57] way anyway a chef recently returned from
[10:37:59] a trip to naton and he started getting
[10:38:01] some ideas he thought he should toughen
[10:38:04] himself up by having his own companion
[10:38:06] you know just like how people from naton
[10:38:08] have soran companion that's like the
[10:38:10] first time wait a second s wait a second
[10:38:13] wait is there like no nline NPCs back
[10:38:16] from nlon wait a listen listen Dam if
[10:38:19] you want to know the details go check
[10:38:21] out the event when the virin is live all
[10:38:24] right but for now it's time for me to
[10:38:26] introduce the game club okay all right
[10:38:29] all right he you all right you got it
[10:38:32] you got in this challenge you can adjust
[10:38:34] the difficulty and your negotiation
[10:38:37] strategies if you've got the G oh my God
[10:38:39] wa that sick wait maybe not I don't know
[10:38:41] what this is yet but you can also talk
[10:38:43] to ronit to adjust the number of
[10:38:45] negotiation strategies so if you reduce
[10:38:49] them difficulty giving you the perfect
[10:38:51] opportunity to test your skills cool
[10:38:53] both active the vagab event is fun I
[10:38:55] don't know if this is available you can
[10:38:57] trigger strategies at will however your
[10:39:00] opponent's HP and level will change
[10:39:03] depending on the number of strategies
[10:39:04] that you've picked cool so yeah so
[10:39:07] you've got to choose your favorite
[10:39:08] strategies to come out on top play to
[10:39:10] your Y what is this team comp by the way
[10:39:13] moving on travel be familiar with our
[10:39:15] next event vibro Crystal applications I
[10:39:19] have never heard of a vibro crystal
[10:39:21] involves connecting different vibrating
[10:39:22] crystals in order to generate different
[10:39:25] effects Aaron I am so impressed by how
[10:39:28] intuitive you are oh my gosh thank that
[10:39:31] means yeah well I meant it each round
[10:39:35] requires two teams before each battle
[10:39:38] set up vibro Crystal harmonics plans for
[10:39:40] each of your teams this will allow you
[10:39:42] to receive different combat Buffs when
[10:39:44] you combine trans this and receiver
[10:39:47] crystals basically the transmitter
[10:39:50] Crystal decides the trigger condition
[10:39:52] while the receiver Crystal determines
[10:39:54] the buff that your team gets as a result
[10:39:56] by connecting them in different
[10:39:57] combinations you can create varying
[10:39:59] harmonic effects this is like old been a
[10:40:02] while spot I think I did this challenge
[10:40:04] when I first got shons you gain a
[10:40:06] harmonic point for each time maybe not I
[10:40:08] don't know actually what the [ __ ] is
[10:40:10] this more combat bonuses if you
[10:40:12] accumulate enough harmonic points yo why
[10:40:15] are you physical plunging you're playing
[10:40:17] so you can choose the harmonic buff that
[10:40:19] works best for your team setup be sure
[10:40:21] to maximize your points if you want to
[10:40:23] exchange them for rewards Max
[10:40:26] nice also the genius invocation TCG
[10:40:29] event the for temper will be rning in
[10:40:32] version 4.6 yes heated battle mode will

[10:40:40] overflowing Mastery event so you can
[10:40:42] more easily train up the characters who

[10:48:52] 2021 okay it's not a new weapon type
[10:48:55] it's still a polearm
[10:48:57] however Uncle Zio bro this was three
[10:49:00] years ago what do you mean Uncle Zio I

[10:49:43] though
[10:49:44] anyways if we can get an axxe we can get
[10:49:46] a scythe true it could be a new weapon
[10:49:49] class or just a pole arm imagine Shia or
[10:49:51] Rosario with a
[10:49:53] scythe okay but dude I okay but but
[10:49:57] aro's po arm dude it
[10:50:01] didn't okay I could be
[10:50:04] wrong like I legit don't know but I'm
[10:50:07] pretty sure it's only a scythe on her
[10:50:10] like that's what it looks like we will
[10:50:12] meet
[10:50:13] again after presenting you with the
[10:50:15] nosis if you accept cuz look we we saw
[10:50:18] her with it I mean I don't know if they
[10:50:19] show it
[10:50:20] here how would you know well it showed
[10:50:23] in the [ __ ]
[10:50:26] [Music]
[10:50:29] trailer no it's not here it's the other
[10:50:36] one it's here look Premiere ended dude
[10:50:40] nobody asked oh I just
[10:50:43] refreshed they show the new weapon is a
[10:50:45] normal sphere yeah exactly
[10:50:47] look it is right here uh it was around
[10:50:49] here actually artifacts it was before
[10:50:51] artifacts right oh right here right here
[10:50:55] here did I just say right here and then
[10:50:57] miss
[10:50:59] it in oh oh new weapon I saw
[10:51:02] it like this weapon looks sick but it
[10:51:05] doesn't it's not a scythe but then she
[10:51:07] was using it and it was a
[10:51:12] scythe um so move move away from the
[10:51:16] like the mic you're loud okay
[10:51:20] sorry if this weapon actually gives her
[10:51:23] a scythe and no one else and no other
[10:51:25] weapon gives her a scythe like I don't
[10:51:26] know if she makes other weapons a scythe
[10:51:27] but if it's literally only this one then
[10:51:29] this is the biggest like weapon you need
[10:51:31] in the world it better be good dude cuz
[10:51:33] that is like
[10:51:39] yo pay to C weapon true
[10:51:43] actually Homa 2 dude if H is insane on
[10:51:47] Hut but imagine if H was also a
[10:51:52] scythe but I don't know like I don't
[10:51:54] know the stats like not even like
[10:51:56] genuinely I don't know it's not so we'll
[10:51:57] see but so The Wanderer andu will return
[10:52:00] in the second phase so be sure to keep
[10:52:02] an eye out Y what does our artifacts do
[10:52:05] I I don't think they [ __ ] said did
[10:52:06] they let me know when it's out I last
[10:52:09] time so last time Mar sh and golden
[10:52:12] troop they didn't uh announce it on the
[10:52:14] stream but then the next day they did
[10:52:16] and like a web event thing like a
[10:52:17] preview thing and then it showed
[10:52:23] it it looks like Shia spear wait does
[10:52:26] this look usable on Shia let's see like
[10:52:28] like aesthetic wise doesn't really match
[10:52:31] him but it looks cool available also The
[10:52:34] Wanderer and baiju will return in the
[10:52:36] second phase so be sure to Nave and
[10:52:39] Linny will
[10:52:42] both she's kind of a Savage I mean
[10:52:47] um right so arino even has a special
[10:52:49] kind of movement whenever she uses her
[10:52:51] charged attack right oo that looks
[10:52:53] perfect for scaring dude that's so
[10:52:55] [ __ ] sick dude what the
[10:52:58] hell and you telling me she can
[10:53:02] fly you're telling me a shrimp fried
[10:53:04] this
[10:53:09] rice putting some serious pressure on
[10:53:12] them
[10:53:14] [Laughter]
[10:53:17] uhhuh combination of the primordial Jade
[10:53:19] Spear and Vortex
[10:53:20] vanquisher you keep the vortex
[10:53:23] vanquisher out of uh arleo's mouth you
[10:53:26] don't even mention that [ __ ] that
[10:53:28] worthless ass spear around arlino or
[10:53:31] sh's weapon for that matter keep your
[10:53:33] [ __ ] Vortex vanquisher to yourself
[10:53:35] and don't mention it around here this
[10:53:37] looks like a jade spear but
[10:53:39] like not Jade and barely a spear but you
[10:53:42] know what I mean
[10:53:44] Crimson Moon semblance will also become
[10:53:47] available I see what you're saying
[10:53:49] though W and will return in the second
[10:53:52] phase so be sure to keep an eye out
[10:53:54] y um wait chat wasn't there a Byer rerun
[10:53:58] soon or am I like recently or am I like
[10:54:01] misremembering when was byer's

[10:56:24] type of [ __ ] I don't know what it's

[10:56:29] [Music]
[10:56:31] chori bro like dude that's is that an i
[10:56:35] it's dude like dude like dude imagine
[10:56:38] think about how much money they would
[10:56:39] make if they sold this skin not even
[10:56:41] sold like like like any form of of of of
[10:56:44] of like available to get this
[10:56:47] kid I mean okay I think arleo's base
[10:56:49] model looks sick to be fair but I'm just
[10:56:55] [Music]
[10:56:58] saying dude is this not taboo wait taboo
[10:57:02] smash braw
[10:57:17] I don't I can't find a good picture
[10:57:26] but wow not
[10:57:29] even the meme from HSR oh what the eye
[10:57:44] [Music]
[10:57:46] oh yeah yeah when the when it [ __ ]
[10:57:48] like yoinks her [ __ ] Firefly
[10:57:57] yeah wow not even Linny and fremin have
[10:58:01] seen this
[10:58:03] side
[10:58:08] oh so the Nave is accepting Challengers
[10:58:11] now said boring patch that's bait you
[10:58:14] are a page chatter so elegant
[10:58:16] also I mean they their own right that
[10:58:19] feels even more badass with twice the
[10:58:24] bad
[10:58:25] attitude it's not so simple to see the
[10:58:27] names on tast safe for chlorin not even
[10:58:30] okay I mean that's fair chlorin is also
[10:58:32] pretty
[10:58:33] hype at first as if she were giving you
[10:58:36] an ordinary training lesson waiting to
[10:58:39] or get both seems like she'll Dodge all
[10:58:41] of our attacks like a phantom if we're
[10:58:43] out of her immediate range yeah it feels
[10:58:46] like she's implying but I feel like uh I
[10:58:48] feel like they griefed 4.5 to make 4.6
[10:58:51] POG and then I assume 4.7 will be POG
[10:58:53] cuz it'll probably be chlorin plus that
[10:58:55] other like tiny piece of [ __ ] whatever
[10:58:57] her name is and then [ __ ] uh like D's
[10:59:00] Leaf boom like the quest and then Nat
[10:59:02] land right after so I assume like now on
[10:59:05] it's going to be hype but this patch
[10:59:07] also has a bunch of events so I assume
[10:59:08] it's just going to be like arino Quest
[10:59:10] and then Event Event kind of filler and
[10:59:14] thenm of her hand
[10:59:16] I mean you guys know what her
[10:59:18] personality is like
[10:59:20] disrespect away from conflict instead
[10:59:23] she hopes that skip arlino for
[10:59:27] Siege I I respect your personal
[10:59:30] everyone's personal preferences but that
[10:59:33] has to be a ban there's no
[10:59:36] dude take the initiative even if their
[10:59:39] opponent is their own father the outside
[10:59:42] world will not show her children mercy
[10:59:44] so neither can she afford to be too for
[10:59:46] giving to them if you do not repay the
[10:59:49] blood debt directives the Nave applies
[10:59:50] to you all her attacks against you will
[10:59:53] be enhanced but if you manage to out
[10:59:56] heal the bond of Life the Nave will
[10:59:58] reward you chlorin thighs outsold how do
[11:00:02] you even know what they look like
[11:00:03] chlorin
[11:00:18] never mind I against her will be
[11:00:22] enhanced don't the bone wings are I mean
[11:00:25] to be fair clorindo is like one of if
[11:00:27] not the font 10 character I was the most
[11:00:29] hyped for since we saw the trailer so
[11:00:32] like I'm I I still don't know where the
[11:00:34] [ __ ] she is uh if we're being
[11:00:40] honest but
[11:00:42] um I wonder why what do you mean you
[11:00:45] wonder why why are you acting like you
[11:00:47] you got me bro like what do you want me
[11:00:49] to say look at her also
