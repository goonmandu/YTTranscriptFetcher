[00:24:59] [Music]
[00:25:00] okay Chad can I say something can I say
[00:25:03] something but don't get mad at
[00:25:06] me okay I recorded I recorded two videos
[00:25:09] okay one of them is done well it's like
[00:25:13] one of them is being exported right now
[00:25:15] then I can upload it uh yeah it's a it's
[00:25:19] like a it's it's how do I what's the
[00:25:22] title going to be it is let's call it a
[00:25:23] a a a a a let's call it Advanced tips to
[00:25:27] quick start your your gameplay let's
[00:25:29] call it like that okay because I was
[00:25:30] going to make like something like
[00:25:32] beginner focused but then the more I
[00:25:33] Yapp the more I was like I don't want to
[00:25:35] just say generic [ __ ] well I kind of did
[00:25:37] but then I moved on to more like stuff
[00:25:39] that I would want to hear so it's a bit
[00:25:40] more just like tips so we we'll talk
[00:25:42] about that
[00:25:43] anyways uh I also then I made a second
[00:25:46] video which is
[00:25:48] um about which free Five Star should you
[00:25:51] choose that one is fully done and
[00:25:52] uploaded but I can't public it until my
[00:25:56] other video is out because the other
[00:25:58] video is so the other video I made it
[00:26:00] sponsored like I made it just myself
[00:26:02] normally but I got a sponsored segment
[00:26:04] in it but I need that one to go up
[00:26:06] before the other video because I got
[00:26:08] footage on a test server and I don't
[00:26:09] want to release the non-sponsor one
[00:26:11] before the sponsor one cuz then people
[00:26:12] be like why do you have the anyways but
[00:26:14] but but yeah the only thing I'm worried
[00:26:15] about though is that this was all
[00:26:17] recorded based on my knowledge from the
[00:26:19] cbt2 and
[00:26:22] that are you sponsor for yeah well only
[00:26:25] a bit like like yes but like I'm also
[00:26:27] playing it cuz like I'm sponsor for two
[00:26:29] hours I'm probably going to stream for
[00:26:29] like 12 probably
[00:26:31] 10:
[00:26:34] um anyways the the problem is there's a
[00:26:38] big chance they change a lot of [ __ ]
[00:26:39] when the game's out so if I can't upload
[00:26:41] the video before the game's out I might
[00:26:43] have to remake it all in which case
[00:26:47] oh when you but you have to promise that
[00:26:50] you'll watch my video if I have to
[00:26:51] remake it cuz if not I'm just going to
[00:26:53] scrap it like the gaming guide cuz what
[00:26:55] if they change everything what if Ling
[00:26:57] Yang doesn't feel like [ __ ] [ __ ]
[00:26:58] sorry what if he doesn't what if what if
[00:27:00] he doesn't sorry what if he doesn't feel

[00:27:08] fine reuploading is free money no no no
[00:27:11] like um remake not like like I'm not
[00:27:13] going to post the first one if it's
[00:27:14] wrong like I would just scrap it
[00:27:33] just post the misinformation let's go

[00:56:12] okay I need to stop jumping I I was
[00:56:15] trying to figure out what the optimal
[00:56:16] way to move around in this game is if
[00:56:19] you know chat you can correct me it
[00:56:20] seems to be cuz if you sprint you don't
[00:56:22] use stamina so I think you like Dash
[00:56:24] spam into Sprint could be wrong
[00:56:29] to I'm not actually
[00:56:31] sure I need to optimize my exploration
[00:56:34] safest place around here the residence
[00:56:36] Nexus provides coverage for the whole
[00:56:38] city
[00:56:40] besides maybe it's not
[00:56:43] as W drops are subscribe only xdd yes

[01:07:51] game also chat I mean my [ __ ]
[01:07:56] video is not out for some reason but if
[01:07:58] you're wondering kill literally every
[01:08:01] monster you ever see ever cuz Echoes are
[01:08:02] broken and you need to unlock your
[01:08:04] [ __ ] Data Bank where the [ __ ] is it
[01:08:05] making me go hello
[01:08:11] okay can you stop using sword my brother
[01:08:15] in Christ what do you want me to do get

[01:08:22] how do I already have friend requests
[01:08:23] you guys are [ __ ] fast
[01:08:28] my first friend request is Carlos you
[01:08:30] know what just because you were first I
[01:08:32] will accept you you'll probably get
[01:08:34] deleted in the near future but it is
[01:08:36] what it is that's just life let me kill
[01:08:38] this Turtle I need the
[01:08:44] echo
[01:08:53] synchronization wait chat I have a
[01:08:55] question but can you not get mad at me
[01:08:57] if I ask it cuz I'm supposed to know
[01:08:58] this information but I don't know this
[01:08:59] information
[01:09:02] up uh in the data Bank you okay so this
[01:09:05] is I'm going to give you guys something
[01:09:07] that you should know but then after I'm
[01:09:08] going to ask a dumb question okay so as
[01:09:11] you level the data bank it's important
[01:09:12] because you get rewards but especially
[01:09:13] you unlock better Echoes that's how you
[01:09:14] start absorbing good Echoes right like
[01:09:16] uh if you look at 15 you can get a five
[01:09:18] star and that's when it [ __ ] start get
[01:09:19] starts getting POG and you can Rush this
[01:09:21] if you're grinding okay now my question
[01:09:24] is the following once you're 15 cuz it's
[01:09:26] [ __ ] 3070 split right can you still
[01:09:28] get like a green Echo I assume you can
[01:09:31] cuz if you can't how do you get the XP
[01:09:33] from the green ones if you don't have
[01:09:34] them cuz these give XP or if you get the

[01:19:49] okay hey man
[01:19:58] do you drink coffee with sugar or no
[01:19:59] sugar uh usually no sugar but I like to
[01:20:02] add milk well right now I'm drinking
[01:20:04] black coffee cuz I'm too lazy to add
[01:20:05] milk because the problem is I don't feel
[01:20:07] like frothing or warming up my milk so
[01:20:09] when I make a coffee and then I add milk
[01:20:10] it gets cold and then it kind of it's
[01:20:12] like it's not too cold but it's not too
[01:20:14] hot so it's kind of like drinking a
[01:20:15] coffee you left out at the park for
[01:20:17] maybe 30 minutes and so I'm not a big
[01:20:19] fan unless I warm up the milk but that's
[01:20:22] like I'm
[01:20:23] lazy with or no lactose I try to always
[01:20:25] have lactose so that I don't become
[01:20:27] lactose intolerant because if you don't
[01:20:29] to if you don't like like have certain
[01:20:30] things for a while you can become
[01:20:31] intolerant to them I think I don't know
[01:20:33] I'm not a
[01:20:34] nutritionist I love this girl Hello
[01:20:37] forget her name
[01:20:42] though oh milk's not bad though but I'm
[01:20:45] more of a whole milk well a 2% milk
[01:20:52] person is she analyzing me
[01:20:55] oh it's like
[01:20:56] Louch you know when he does the thing
[01:20:59] and then he
[01:21:03] he please to make your acquaintance I
[01:21:06] apologize for the delay my name is San
[01:21:09] haa The Bodyguard of M is either
[01:21:11] intolerant or not I can't then know I'm
[01:21:12] pretty sure intolerances can be
[01:21:14] developed I'm not a doctor but I know
[01:21:16] doctors kind of I'm pretty sure I'm
[01:21:19] pretty sure that mist I like her voice
[01:21:22] let me shut up prior to her departure
[01:21:24] she instructed me to bring you these
[01:21:26] tokens and a welcome
[01:21:30] gift Madame magistrate adise you to
[01:21:33] explore what these tokens represent
[01:21:35] during her absence this may help you AC
[01:21:39] Dev lactose
[01:21:45] intolerance I apologize for the
[01:21:47] inconvenience but please rest assured
[01:21:50] she will be here to meet you in 3 days
[01:21:52] time
[01:21:57] since Madam magistrate is currently away
[01:21:59] I cannot make the final confirmation on
[01:22:01] her
[01:22:02] behalf but you you are truly exceptional
[01:22:07] regarding that dude I want a main
[01:22:10] character
[01:22:11] okay I want a main character in the game
[01:22:13] that just [ __ ] sucks like they're not
[01:22:15] notable they do nothing special but like
[01:22:18] you have to like you know eventually
[01:22:20] they'll become something cool feel like
[01:22:21] every game is just you are the chosen
[01:22:24] one share the same frequency you have
[01:22:26] the bloodline shared only by Nobles for
[01:22:30] 26 years no one has ever had the same
[01:22:34] eye shadow that you possess my
[01:22:36] description was not accurate sorry both
[01:22:39] you and Madam magistrate look
[01:22:41] undistorted to
[01:22:43] me in my eyes you appear the way you
[01:22:50] are Trailblazer no they're like [ __ ]
[01:22:53] Omega powerful they just get the element
[01:22:55] from like sucking the statue they fight
[01:22:57] [ __ ] with a dull blade I don't know I
[01:23:00] skipped lore
[01:23:02] sorry sorry I skipped lore not really
[01:23:05] like I care about lore but I don't care

[01:24:01] sounds compelling does that make sense
[01:24:02] if it's like
[01:24:05] important I do remember in the
[01:24:08] beta being a big fan of a lot of things
[01:24:11] the gameplay the combat the exploration
[01:24:14] the feel of the characters the
[01:24:15] characters themselves but not being the
[01:24:17] biggest fan of the story so I don't know
[01:24:18] if that changed or
[01:24:20] not it was a beta you know it was a beta
[01:24:32] but also every other game I've played

[02:02:51] I'm an innovat
[02:02:52] you know but I am uh but honestly most
[02:02:54] forms of [ __ ] like at this point most
[02:02:56] genin content is just copy pasted and
[02:02:58] recycled from like one Creator to
[02:03:00] another so I think we'll do another for
[02:03:02] next Abyss maybe this patch but probably
[02:03:04] next

[02:17:49] include this in a video but when I was
[02:17:52] playing before the game came out so not
[02:17:54] on the live servers which is why it's
[02:17:56] okay if there's
[02:17:57] bugs
[02:18:02] uh there was a a
[02:18:05] bug with this guy's alt that was pretty
[02:18:09] detrimental and I want to make sure it
[02:18:11] didn't it's not a real thing cuz I'm
[02:18:14] pretty sure it's not or people would
[02:18:15] have talked about it
[02:18:23] oh wait let me check something really
[02:18:24] fast I'm sorry cuz I want to get this
[02:18:26] video out

[02:19:11] War
[02:19:14] exterminate so I swear to God it's not a
[02:19:16] skill issue granted I was on 300 ping
[02:19:19] but like I made made sure to do
[02:19:21] everything I could for some
[02:19:25] reason All is fair in
[02:19:28] war wait let me do this again War spares
[02:19:31] no
[02:19:40] one you don't get a stack of your I'm
[02:19:42] looking at the meter at the bottom
[02:19:43] you'll get a stack on your first hit on
[02:19:45] alt but anyways for some reason um I
[02:19:49] couldn't get past that part of the tour
[02:19:50] cuz the last six basic wouldn't work
[02:19:52] like I literally did it for 30 minutes
[02:19:53] and I know I wasn't [ __ ] up I have
[02:19:55] the footage if like proof is needed but
[02:19:57] like I think it was just the the server
[02:19:58] I was on was was um not optimized but as
[02:20:02] long as it's not here for live it's fine
[02:20:04] All is fair and
[02:20:06] War I wasn't sure if they like got it
[02:20:09] something
[02:20:12] but it's
[02:20:14] time copium hopeful it's not [ __ ]
[02:20:17] copium buddy
[02:20:20] misery
[02:20:23] follows I thought it was cuz it wouldn't
[02:20:25] get the first stack on the first hit but
[02:20:26] I guess it's not that cuz I'm still not
[02:20:28] getting the first hat on the first stack
[02:20:29] on the first
[02:20:30] hit I guess that's normal
[02:20:35] though there's no 120 no I don't think
[02:20:37] so spare and
[02:20:45] War what El the fear

[02:50:26] got calaro chisa all of justice At Your
[02:50:30] Service we got calaro and then at the
[02:50:33] end of the day he came home to roost
[02:50:37] welcome home King welcome home King I
[02:50:41] have never regretted to Brave the long
[02:50:43] night
[02:50:50] that's my
[02:50:52] goat this is my goat and I am one of the
[02:50:56] few streamers you'll watch who will keep
[02:50:58] Gan as his Goat as time passes because
[02:51:02] not only do I actually stay true to my
[02:51:04] Mains now look there's other characters
[02:51:05] I like I like Yin I think she's great
[02:51:07] there's other characters you know I
[02:51:09] think are cool but I know how it is in
[02:51:12] these gacha streets okay female
[02:51:15] character everyone's drooling Gan no one
[02:51:17] cares I care sorry I think it's
[02:51:26] cool
[02:51:29] lament anyways um the only problem is
[02:51:33] okay so in weing waves you eventually
[02:51:36] will need up to let me get back how many
[02:51:38] I had I had 333 granted there's 90 from
[02:51:40] the thing but I don't care
[02:51:42] 333 boom so we're back at where we were
[02:51:44] okay cool now look let me say something
[02:51:47] in weathering waves
[02:51:49] there's different ways to build team
[02:51:50] depending on the content you're doing
[02:51:51] all that okay cool uh typically these
[02:51:55] are two main DPSS
[02:51:58] however uh not only can I just you know
[02:52:00] swap between them and it's fine don't
[02:52:02] talk to me but
[02:52:03] secondly um there's going to be there's
[02:52:06] content where you need up to three teams
[02:52:07] of three 3 * three nine therefore having
[02:52:12] multiple DPSS isn't a a bad thing also
[02:52:16] this looks like the hunt icon am I
[02:52:18] coping
[02:52:22] I low key don't need a Healer
[02:52:31] conception yo
[02:52:34] chat are you yo are you thinking what
[02:52:36] I'm thinking or no be honest if you are
[02:52:38] you know cool if you're not that's fine
[02:52:41] too I probably can't even level it
[02:52:45] though no I don't like weapon banners
[02:52:54] it is guaranteed
[02:52:59] though LOL that's Cal dude it's true
[02:53:03] Bust or maybe you'll take it all what
[02:53:05] okay got a vent in the
[02:53:07] chat it's guaranteed okay
[02:53:12] look
[02:53:14] look before I say what I'm about to say
[02:53:16] I'm going to I'm going to preface this
[02:53:19] play weathering waves now smark
[02:53:21] weathering waves uh free to play you can
[02:53:23] play it on on available across different
[02:53:25] uh platforms uh you can use my code
[02:53:27] weathering gift uh uh uh well a code is
[02:53:30] not exclusively mine get some rewards
[02:53:32] okay
[02:53:34] however the weapon B being guaranteed is
[02:53:36] sick but I
[02:53:39] still okay I haven't experienced how
[02:53:42] difficult this game is yet however I
[02:53:45] feel like I I it's I would probably
[02:53:48] rather spend my gems on characters than
[02:53:51] weapons however he is an exception and
[02:53:55] it's
[02:53:58] content how do I check the like
[02:54:00] odds let me read what this does high
[02:54:03] well I assume that's a high base attack
[02:54:05] well it's way higher than this but this
[02:54:07] is a defense scaling weapon 33 47 10.8
[02:54:11] crit
[02:54:12] damage increase the damage bonus of all
[02:54:14] residents attributes by
[02:54:16] 12% okay every time in skill or
[02:54:18] resonance Liberation so alt is cast
[02:54:21] increase heavy attack by 24% St two
[02:54:25] times so my heavy attack is
[02:54:28] buffed when I intro skill or when I
[02:54:33] alt let me look at my
[02:54:37] scalings hold the Bas
[02:54:39] attack release base
[02:54:44] attack replaced by LS of I don't know
[02:54:47] how to pronounce that
[02:54:50] uh heavy
[02:54:51] attack oh okay so all my attacks are
[02:54:53] heavy attacks when I
[02:54:55] alt as R things that you
[02:54:58] gifted okay that's a pretty good weapon
[02:55:01] wait what is the battle pass weapon do I
[02:55:03] have battle pass
[02:55:05] yet
[02:55:09] uh no I don't convene that's pushing
[02:55:18] okay if I have a four-star sword I won't
[02:55:20] pull agre oh
[02:55:23] [ __ ]
[02:55:25] oh
[02:55:32] yeah yeah I don't know I don't know I
[02:55:34] don't know I don't know dude let me save
[02:55:35] it for

[02:56:25] think he still has the zipper on
[02:56:29] his critical area these cards Theus is
[02:56:35] likely crotch that's the
[02:56:40] word dude I love this character let me
[02:56:43] at least get him to 20 I'm I'm not

[03:01:59] understanding nothing more is there is
[03:02:01] there a slip button if yes I'll play yes
[03:02:03] but not for certain main story parts and
[03:02:06] tell me what you like for the irrelevant
[03:02:07] stuff there is but for this there isn't
[03:02:09] as you learn more about this world your
[03:02:12] true desires will surface and our little
[03:02:15] game will become even more more
[03:02:18] entertaining and before that I don't
[03:02:21] want anyone to disturb my precious alone
[03:02:24] time with you that's
[03:02:29] all ah why do you have to assume we are
[03:02:32] the culprits maybe you should be asking
[03:02:35] me what actually happened chronic things
[03:02:36] are too gifted I won't tell you
[03:02:39] everything I won't tell you everything
[03:02:42] what do you see a large scale
[03:02:45] ritual Bravo didn't think you'd C now
[03:02:50] what is the conclusion you've
[03:02:52] drawn the villagers killed each
[03:02:56] other I see you don't really trust those
[03:03:04] villagers right about you I like it your
[03:03:08] Keen observation precise judgment and
[03:03:12] accurate understanding of human
[03:03:15] nature let me give you a couple more
[03:03:21] tips also I've just been informed
[03:03:23] apparently than you
[03:03:25] think through my sources the weing gift
[03:03:29] code that is uh provided to you by me
[03:03:32] and also other people is good you get
[03:03:35] rewards I'm pretty sure the other codes
[03:03:37] are fake or bait so yeah that's the code
[03:03:40] to use in game you also get stuff if you
[03:03:42] give two subs but that's unrelated at
[03:03:45] all first I could red it if you guys are
[03:03:48] like how do you redeem it cuz I forget
[03:03:49] how but I'm pretty sure you just open
[03:03:50] the menu and then you go redeem but I'll
[03:03:52] do it in a second cuz I need I need the
[03:03:54] code too I didn't claim
[03:03:56] it next what our main plot false
[03:04:02] devotion kind kindness Collective deceit
[03:04:06] senseless killings and the one
[03:04:09] vulnerable Soul pushed onto a path of
[03:04:12] Destruction by the masses this guy
[03:04:15] pretty good now Rover
[03:04:18] the story is your he's kind of
[03:04:20] snapping I'm eager to hear your version
[03:04:23] after you've learned
[03:04:27] more wait chat is it weird okay listen
[03:04:30] I'm I'm pretty healthy kind of not
[03:04:32] really but but you know like I drink
[03:04:34] water coffee is it weird that I kind of
[03:04:36] am craving a Red Bull right now thoughts
[03:04:39] thoughts or

[03:04:59] tonight it's probably CU you drink it so
[03:05:01] much I drink genuinely I think the I've
[03:05:04] had one Red Bull this year like I don't
[03:05:07] drink it a lot I usually just coffee but
[03:05:09] I'm going to be streaming for like 20
[03:05:10] hours also I'm doing another W stream
[03:05:13] tomorrow and another one the day after
[03:05:15] like guaranteed and then we we have free
[03:05:17] uh we we we we we we figure out I was
[03:05:19] going to say free will but it's more I
[03:05:20] figure out what I want to do however I
[03:05:22] think there's the live preview stream to
[03:05:24] do after that too so probably four days
[03:05:25] in a row
[03:05:29] overworking oh yeah we'll do the 2.2
[03:05:32] quest
[03:05:35] after okay wait let me figure out how to
[03:05:37] redeem this actually I've never redeemed
[03:05:38] a code yet is it it's it's probably in
[03:05:40] here right okay yeah there you go he's
[03:05:42] just naturally talented you open your
[03:05:44] menu you press Escape right you open
[03:05:45] your menu you click on setting you go
[03:05:47] here on the little wrench thing you boom
[03:05:50] redemption code redeem let me type it
[03:05:51] weaing gift it should work if it doesn't
[03:05:53] this is embarrassing it
[03:05:57] worked POG asites and XP and other stuff
[03:06:02] nice it
[03:06:08] works Chad if only you knew how many of
[03:06:10] like the live stream codes I forgot to
[03:06:12] redeem across the games I've played it's
[03:06:14] actually Criminal
[03:06:17] you've been struck by a smooth
[03:06:24] criminal now I wonder what is your
[03:06:27] takeaway from this story you need to be
[03:06:29] level two first answer me and I'll
[03:06:31] reveal the truth of what happened who
[03:06:34] was the real culprit behind the
[03:06:36] diminishing it was the Shepherds they
[03:06:39] betrayed the Lambs indeed the direct
[03:06:43] culprit was the shepherd he held all the
[03:06:46] power fulfilling wishes at a
[03:06:49] price the Lambs knew the risk okay I'm
[03:06:52] getting a drink wait I've already seen
[03:06:54] this though I played the beta I'll let
[03:06:55] it autoplay cuz you guys didn't see it
[03:06:56] okay in the face of such Temptation they
[03:07:00] disregarded all the hidden risks as
[03:07:03] disaster had yet to befall them if they
[03:07:06] were given another chance I believe they
[03:07:09] would still choose the same path
[03:07:12] inevitably they accepted their fate and
[03:07:15] paid the price when their time came
[03:07:18] now my second
[03:07:20] question what price did the Lambs pay
[03:07:23] for their
[03:07:39] wishes okay [ __ ] it we're unhealthy
[03:07:45] today this a new flavor I haven't tried
[03:07:48] I don't want to like promote it though
[03:07:49] cuz I I we're # add in weaing waves
[03:07:51] right now but I I I want to see if it's
[03:07:53] good or not not not not sponsored is it
[03:07:56] good it's called Aussie lemonade
[03:08:00] flavor I'm judging all of Australia on
[03:08:02] this what this is so sour of course as
[03:08:06] always Jesus the most valuable thing
[03:08:09] they had to offer here's my final
[03:08:13] question what happened to the black lamb
[03:08:17] don't rush Rover take your time what is
[03:08:22] the truth you've
[03:08:28] uncovered the shepherd was granting
[03:08:31] wishes by sacrificing the lives of
[03:08:34] lambs the flock found out the truth but
[03:08:36] chose to be his
[03:08:38] accomp and they willingly offered the BL
[03:08:40] it's actually pretty good just really
[03:08:43] sour that's right this guy's insane I
[03:08:47] could not fix
[03:08:49] them little lambs cowed and huddled in
[03:08:52] their Village terrified of the relent
[03:08:55] wolf which fre you recommend to
[03:08:58] get dude I have a full video done ready
[03:09:02] to upload about that and providing
[03:09:04] shelter and sustenance but tldr I'll
[03:09:07] give it off to the scut
[03:09:08] scene slowly the shepher gained control
[03:09:12] over the flock and the Lambs lived
[03:09:15] contented lives
[03:09:18] but this is not the end of our
[03:09:24] story The Shepherd found the solitary
[03:09:27] black lamb in his flock and offered to
[03:09:31] Grant any wish it desired in exchange he
[03:09:36] wanted one of its companions as a
[03:09:43] sacrifice the black lamb refused and it
[03:09:47] was shunned by its flock left without
[03:09:51] shelter or
[03:09:54] sustenance me when the villain has a
[03:09:56] convincing analogy more LS Contin to I
[03:10:01] forgive him the then blamed the black
[03:10:05] laamb for breaking the
[03:10:08] rules and withheld His Wish granting
[03:10:11] power as punishment
[03:10:21] from the very beginning the ls knew the
[03:10:24] risk of makes they could become
[03:10:28] sacrifices for those of others sorry I
[03:10:31] can tell you guys what's happening after
[03:10:32] one second believed it wouldn't be
[03:10:37] them
[03:10:38] okay meanwhile some Lambs reasoned that
[03:10:42] since they had already risked being
[03:10:43] sacrificed for someone else's wish it
[03:10:46] was only fair to pass on that risk for a
[03:10:50] chance at fulfilling their own desires
[03:10:53] and so they continued to play the
[03:10:58] game they all knew the consequences but
[03:11:01] chose to remain
[03:11:04] silent fearful yet greedy they followed
[03:11:09] the shepherd's orders and made wishes
[03:11:13] again and again until one day
[03:11:17] a brave black lamb spoke up chattering
[03:11:22] the flocks facade their illusion of a
[03:11:26] peaceful and happy
[03:11:34] life way and that of the shepher gy
[03:11:38] pursuit sparking hatred in their hearts
[03:11:42] it's pretty cool
[03:11:47] ignore the blood and Ashes of past
[03:11:51] sacrifices littering the
[03:11:55] ground
[03:11:57] okay I find codes wait why does my
[03:11:59] message Auto unpin I had it pined you
[03:12:02] like my story
[03:12:04] hello how do I pin a message forever
[03:12:06] really happened here oh it unpins after
[03:12:08] 20 minutes
[03:12:10] oops the black Lambs who rebelled
[03:12:13] against the rules and the white Lambs
[03:12:16] who suum to their greed I'm going to be
[03:12:18] honest I'm too dumb to get your uh
[03:12:20] metaphor but I'm sure that was cool scar
[03:12:22] turned on each other it looked cool it
[03:12:26] coming all the shepherd had to do was
[03:12:29] execute the rebel that's how he that's
[03:12:32] crazy
[03:12:36] bro oh it's this again oh this is pretty
[03:12:39] sick I remember
[03:12:43] this now we fight him
[03:12:46] [Music]

[03:13:39] then I played him and personally no
[03:13:41] disrespect he was cool but he felt
[03:13:44] clunky and a bit inconsistent but then I
[03:13:47] played
[03:13:48] him
[03:13:50] um in the footage for the video you're
[03:13:52] going to see and he felt different but I
[03:13:55] don't know if it's Placebo cuz I'm just
[03:13:57] one person so I can't tell if he's
[03:13:59] actually smoother does anyone who's like

[03:14:04] he's got like if they change

[04:16:42] amazing when you joined the

[04:17:20] but I don't know why I I locked myself
[04:17:22] in this Quest before finishing what I
[04:17:24] wanted to finish I did it I thought it
[04:17:26] would be 2 seconds it's fine it was a
[04:17:28] cool Quest I got to spend time with Ling
[04:17:30] yangang F yeah sure let's talk somewhere
[04:17:34] more private it's your quest that's not
[04:17:36] me little bro
[04:17:46] did he crash yeah I think earlier the
[04:17:47] stream crashed for like two seconds
[04:17:48] apparently but refresh if well if you
[04:17:50] can hear me then there's no need to
[04:17:51] refresh but if you can't hear me refresh
[04:17:53] but if you can't hear me then how would
[04:17:55] you know to refresh I don't know we
[04:17:56] should probably pin the message again
[04:17:57] though it's not needed I just I I I
[04:17:59] chose to pin it aboba Rover let's talk
[04:18:03] here about the jingle
[04:18:06] [Music]
[04:18:08] Beast where should I
[04:18:11] begin is Anor good DPS yes unless they
[04:18:14] nerfed her I think a lot of characters
[04:18:16] got a little nerfed
[04:18:17] but she was good I think she's still
[04:18:20] good but I don't know if it
[04:18:24] changed uncontrolled emotions in human
[04:18:27] resonators over time most of them died
[04:18:30] out driven extinct by their unrestrained
[04:18:34] desires beasts that can bring their
[04:18:36] power under control are extremely rare
[04:18:40] but they do exist
[04:18:44] and the jingle Beast it a long long time
[04:18:48] ago the jingle Beast wasn't called the
[04:18:51] jingle Beast it was called
[04:18:59] Swani sorry I was yapping that's a
[04:19:02] ferocious
[04:19:04] name back then the swan lived a tranquil
[04:19:08] life in deep
[04:19:10] forests however
[04:19:12] when the tcid fields expanded rapidly
[04:19:16] their territories were not
[04:19:18] spared some of them humans suffered
[04:19:22] greatly against the swan with their
[04:19:24] terrifying appearance powerful resonance
[04:19:27] abilities and wild animal
[04:19:30] instincts and that's why the swanes were
[04:19:34] deemed evil how do you know all that
[04:19:37] because
[04:19:39] I uh oh I read it in an old book cop I
[04:19:43] know what you are lingyang the swan have
[04:19:46] nearly gone extinct over the years and
[04:19:50] now there might be only one of them
[04:19:53] remaining am I talking to him
[04:19:56] and I've heard of an interesting Theory
[04:20:00] from that last Swani might have yearned
[04:20:04] to become a
[04:20:05] human to make itself more approachable
[04:20:09] it first came up with a less
[04:20:10] intimidating name something like the
[04:20:14] jingle Beast he was the jingle Beast all
[04:20:17] along and then no yanked off
[04:20:22] no file down it's claw watching this
[04:20:26] don't talk to
[04:20:30] me fifth stream or this time it didn't
[04:20:33] crash though I manually reset it it

[04:26:06] mean okay okay okay I feel bad so as
[04:26:08] soon as like half okay as soon as

[04:26:15] 5K when when we get 4k people here I'll
[04:26:17] give away a GN okay cuz I F I feel bad
[04:26:19] I'll give away two [ __ ] it but not like
[04:26:21] back like I I'll do one and then I'll
[04:26:22] wait a little bit and I'll do another
[04:26:23] one okay okay I also said I owe you a
[04:26:26] temp pole but I thought about it a bit
[04:26:28] and I might as well do a beginner Temple
[04:26:29] cuz why the [ __ ] would I pull on this
[04:26:30] this is some whale [ __ ] I'm
[04:26:33] sorry didn't say you do three okay yeah
[04:26:35] but like the third was supposed to be a
[04:26:36] surprise why are you spoiling it okay
[04:26:39] [ __ ] you now now I want to scam you
[04:26:42] I wouldn't scam you I wouldn't scam you
[04:26:45] you are a whale though that's a
[04:26:46] compelling
[04:26:54] argument I got a three
[04:27:04] star um okay
[04:27:08] let's nice and spicy let's let's okay we
[04:27:10] need to Echo Farm I need to get the data
[04:27:12] B level so I can get three star Echoes
[04:27:13] okay and then we need to get four star
[04:27:14] Echoes so in order to do that fighting
[04:27:16] bosses and then not spending your
[04:27:17] stamina is actually a very efficient way
[04:27:19] of doing it orander than for 5 it means
[04:27:21] a lot I really appreciate it uh let's go
[04:27:23] I crownless I know how to I get to this
[04:27:25] guy let's F
[04:27:28] him echo's aware the thing with Echoes
[04:27:31] that's nice is that if you
[04:27:36] um if you grind the game you can get a
[04:27:40] ton of Echoes without having to spend
[04:27:42] like stamina CU you can constantly kill
[04:27:44] things over and over and over again and
[04:27:46] like go to other people's worlds and
[04:27:48] stuff like that which is cool the grind
[04:27:49] aspect is there and I like
[04:27:54] that oh what you don't like that

[04:40:08] problem is you get him for free so now
[04:40:09] we got another one but you know a con
[04:40:11] second copy you know we take
[04:40:19] those I got Encore how is she she's
[04:40:21] pretty good she's the main DPS uh
[04:40:24] parrying is ass with her
[04:40:26] but well from range at least but outside
[04:40:30] of that she's good just swap cancel her
[04:40:32] charge Shack inside of her alt her like
[04:40:34] um whatever this is called again
[04:40:37] concerto what is the word for that I
[04:40:39] know it's conserto energy but what is
[04:40:40] the word is is it Liberation no
[04:40:42] liberation's alt Forte circuit Forte
[04:40:45] that's the word yeah you can swap cancel
[04:40:48] her
[04:40:50] forte it's like a huge
[04:41:00] animation sometimes dude I I I don't
[04:41:02] know what the [ __ ] word for this is
[04:41:04] but sometimes when there's a new game
[04:41:05] and there's like a tech that's
[04:41:06] discovered people make it seem like it's
[04:41:08] the [ __ ] hardest thing to do when
[04:41:10] it's literally one button
[04:41:11] and it's like feel like oh yeah they're
[04:41:13] hard to play and execute their Combos
[04:41:14] and the combo is literally like press a
[04:41:17] button and swap like oh wow that was
[04:41:20] hard it's
[04:41:27] time like I know this Advanced Tech and
[04:41:31] the tech is Press
[04:41:33] Two sorry
[04:41:42] tell Tru from the target
[04:41:45] confirmed stay Cal gen [ __ ] players I
[04:41:48] can't okay true but it's the same I've
[04:41:50] seen one more player say the same
[04:41:54] thing and star rail it's not
[04:42:04] exclusive the newer the game the more
[04:42:06] it's like that and then it normalizes
[04:42:12] uh I what the [ __ ] is this again hello
[04:42:16] hello
[04:42:19] hello let me get these
[04:42:26] first bro hate some people smarter than
[04:42:28] him no I don't even think I'm smart
[04:42:30] however I hate when there's like
[04:42:32] knowledge that's okay I don't know how
[04:42:34] to explain this but like in the early
[04:42:35] days of
[04:42:37] genin everyone thought kaching was hard
[04:42:39] for like a long time but just because
[04:42:41] she has like 50 builds but like she
[04:42:43] wasn't that [ __ ] hard just like it
[04:42:45] wasn't explained well same like people
[04:42:47] don't think alam's complicated like it's
[04:42:48] not hard to [ __ ] play them it's just
[04:42:50] I don't know it tilts me when it's like
[04:42:53] easy like a lot of knowledge is locked
[04:42:55] behind oh they're too complicated when
[04:42:57] it's just like people make them seem
[04:42:58] complicated like it's not that
[04:43:06] hard or child child does have advanced
[04:43:08] Tech like to be fair he does but you
[04:43:11] know you don't need to know everything
[04:43:13] like you don't need to
[04:43:14] [ __ ] well that's more so if you don't
[04:43:16] have Cosa and you're Roba swirling but
[04:43:17] like that's not even that bad you just
[04:43:19] press E when you see an exclamation mark
[04:43:20] over guoba you're
[04:43:25] [Music]
[04:43:31] welcome wait I actually okay wait what
[04:43:33] do I need to do for this puzzle let me
[04:43:35] see there's no like explody
[04:43:38] thing oh there's a light thing right
[04:43:39] there I probably interact with it
[04:43:44] wait what the [ __ ] why did that one
[04:43:46] light up oh that's have the kill
[04:43:51] [ __ ] oh yeah maybe it's
[04:43:57] that I
[04:44:02] see I thise hm's not hard where you
[04:44:05] disagree with me I said them isn't hard
[04:44:06] that's what I said but I said people
[04:44:08] make them seem overly
[04:44:09] complicated it's not a bad thing for
[04:44:11] like a character to be hard it's just
[04:44:13] you don't want people to be like oh I
[04:44:14] can't play this character because
[04:44:15] they're too hard when like if you
[04:44:17] explain it to them in a simpler way
[04:44:19] they'll be like oh this character is
[04:44:20] pretty
[04:44:36] easy for emergencies
[04:44:44] but I feel like uh yeah weing waves
[04:44:47] learning curve is a lot different though
[04:44:48] because you actually have to like learn
[04:44:50] enemy attack okay unless you're like
[04:44:52] overleveled or the end game content like
[04:44:55] you can Breeze through it uh a lot of it
[04:44:57] is like you actually have to know enemy
[04:44:59] attack pattern so you can Dodge or Parry
[04:45:01] or both which is cool I think that's
[04:45:06] cool and then there's the other stuff
[04:45:08] like building your [ __ ] your characters
[04:45:09] teams rotations like that that's like
[04:45:11] the normal stuff but then on top of that
[04:45:13] there's the other thing which is cool I
[04:45:16] I I like that part of weathering
[04:45:25] waves
[04:45:30] finale what the [ __ ]
[04:45:50] will you stream live stream
[04:45:52] tomorrow what do you
[04:45:54] mean I'm streaming weather moves again
[04:45:56] tomorrow and the day
[04:45:58] after uh whenever there's the the 4.7
[04:46:01] preview stream if that's what you're
[04:46:02] asking I will also stream that wouldn't
[04:46:04] hurt to be more is that tomorrow no way
[04:46:07] I guess it's past midnight so like 2
[04:46:08] days technically I don't know what the
[04:46:10] math on that
[04:46:13] is Friday yeah but it's [ __ ] oh I
[04:46:17] guess it's technically Thursday okay
[04:46:18] wait it actually is oh I guess I'm
[04:46:21] staying up all
[04:46:22] night why am I fighting the crownless
[04:46:24] again echo
[04:46:27] echo Lars Action Hero thanks they too

[04:46:40] cuz
[04:46:41] undergeared
[04:46:43] break notice how I'm dodging everything
[04:46:45] perfectly yeah yeah I know I
[04:46:57] noticed yeah I
[04:47:03] Parry Target confir yeah I'm like that
[04:47:07] uh if you like that wait this Auto
[04:47:11] well okay how many Autos one part of her
[04:47:13] kid is like attack three times or
[04:47:15] something I forget there's a reason to
[04:47:17] Auto attack on her I just can't remember
[04:47:28] why
[04:47:31] um maybe I don't care
[04:47:47] hello I don't
[04:47:56] remember stacks on alt is
[04:48:08] it I don't know
[04:48:15] okay Verity
[04:48:18] shines ready for
[04:48:21] battle time to fight is intro and outro
[04:48:24] the same thing no yes it no they're
[04:48:26] different they're different but the
[04:48:28] thing is is like when you um when the
[04:48:31] thing lights up on the I'm trying to
[04:48:32] talk I'm not good enough at the I'm not
[04:48:34] good enough to talking treat to
[04:48:38] advance time to Oh I thought I could
[04:48:40] like

[04:48:52] can Parry when you outro stay calm I'm
[04:48:54] terrible I'm terrible lock in lock in I
[04:48:57] thought I could bury okay okay okay
[04:48:59] sorry sorry I tried to attack that but I
[04:49:02] have to dodge there you go I got it my
[04:49:04] fault my fault okay so when you outro
[04:49:06] skill the other character you swap into
[04:49:07] intro skills you get me
[04:49:13] but intro and outro skills are different
[04:49:15] things they just happen at the same time
[04:49:16] like look I'm going to boom boom
[04:49:20] Ser oh wait I'm on a [ __ ] Catalyst

[05:20:29] trap like oh you activated my trap card
[05:20:32] I'm sorry it's not that serious I just
[05:20:35] I'm sorry I don't know why I'm yelling

[05:20:41] wor I'm sorry it's not that serious do
[05:20:45] you know what is
[05:20:46] serious this call to action you should
[05:20:48] download weathering waves using my link
[05:20:49] XM Mark weaing waves thank you to them
[05:20:51] for sponsoring the last two hours of the
[05:20:53] stream although I lasted longer uh uh
[05:20:56] weaing gift is uh uh my code you can use
[05:20:58] it for rewards uh free to play uh uh uh
[05:21:01] uh available on multiple platforms open
[05:21:03] world action RPG I think I don't I let
[05:21:06] me make sure that's actually the
[05:21:07] description
[05:21:10] it is open world arpg developed by Kuro
[05:21:12] games I'm actually the goat we're going
[05:21:13] to keep playing the game we're not
[05:21:14] ending but I'm going to conclude the
[05:21:16] sponsor segment so I could remove the
[05:21:17] the the code and stuff just cuz it takes
[05:21:18] screen space and now I can like I don't
[05:21:20] feel bad about things that I say just
[05:21:22] you know to be safe but we're still
[05:21:23] going to play the game still so nothing
[05:21:25] changes but okay cool
[05:21:29] anyways I'm glad they sponsored me uh
[05:21:32] and we're doing another one tomorrow
[05:21:34] which is sick I still feel bad about the
[05:21:36] stream crashing but it is what it is
[05:21:52] Lydia you don't need to delete the
[05:21:54] message it's fine we're not we're not
[05:21:56] sponsored segment anymore Verity shines
[05:22:00] someone asked will it kill genin you're
[05:22:02] wide open
[05:22:15] wouldn't hurt to be more
[05:22:27] prepared see the reason I scoff at that
[05:22:30] question is uh I think people
[05:22:43] trolls allowed now
[05:22:46] yes it's not your fault I mean I I don't
[05:22:49] really care if they're banned or
[05:22:50] unbanned I'm just saying uh or timed out
[05:22:52] or not timed
[05:22:53] out it's just what like I don't
[05:22:57] know I don't know how to like I don't
[05:22:59] know how to phrase what I'm trying to
[05:23:00] phrase I can take
[05:23:04] it it's just easier to clickbait if you
[05:23:07] like run it that way but like it ideally
[05:23:09] it's just multiple games coexist that's
[05:23:11] pretty bog no like no one in their right
[05:23:14] mind thinks A Game's killing another
[05:23:15] game like if you think that I'm sorry
[05:23:18] like I'm actually sorry I mean I'm not
[05:23:20] sorry like it is what it is but I am
[05:23:21] sorry I just failed the
[05:23:33] puzzle games kill themselves yeah for
[05:23:36] the most part
[05:23:41] competition breaths Innovation yes
[05:23:50] absolutely but like look sponsor segment
[05:23:53] ended I'm being turbo honest I really
[05:23:56] enjoy this game breath and I think a lot
[05:23:59] of people that enjoy one game will enjoy
[05:24:01] the other game or will prefer one to the
[05:24:03] other and that's fine and that's cool
[05:24:05] that you don't need to [ __ ] like
[05:24:06] there's no benefit to being like
[05:24:09] I I also feel like like this is my take
[05:24:12] I even feel like the people that like
[05:24:14] are either working on genin or are
[05:24:16] working on weathering waves probably
[05:24:18] like the other game too like I'm just
[05:24:19] being honest that's just my guess I
[05:24:21] could be wrong I I don't know but like
[05:24:22] there's a good chance you just are a fan
[05:24:24] of both and that's okay or you only like
[05:24:26] one like that's okay
[05:24:29] too it's not like
[05:24:31] uh there's always like an enemy
[05:24:33] narrative between like [ __ ] two games
[05:24:35] I don't know it kind of tilts me it was
[05:24:37] the same with [ __ ] what like Star
[05:24:39] Rail and genin which are owned by the
[05:24:41] same company I never understood that
[05:24:43] [ __ ] well I did understand it cuz I got
[05:24:45] it explained to me like I was a
[05:24:46] 2-year-old like actually it causes
[05:24:49] better rewards it's like yeah okay but
[05:24:51] like you know it's the same company
[05:24:53] right although Grant I think competition
[05:24:55] from different companies is good
[05:25:00] naturally I missed I [ __ ]
[05:25:06] missed what the
[05:25:26] no one plays starl that's not true
[05:25:42] now I think if you're like I think the
[05:25:43] winner right now is the consumer well
[05:25:45] unless you're like spending all your
[05:25:47] life savings on gotra please don't do
[05:25:49] that please don't fomo anything you are
[05:25:52] not willing to lose and never get back
[05:25:55] okay okay
[05:25:57] um
[05:26:01] however imagine you're just like imagine
[05:26:03] you like either of the games or you like
[05:26:05] all of the games you're winning cuz you
[05:26:07] have so much [ __ ] content
[05:26:14] and I'm I'm a I'm you know I give
[05:26:15] everything a
[05:26:26] shot except Elder ring don't talk to
[05:26:31] me what do you think so far I'm enjoying
[05:26:33] it but we haven't got into like the new
[05:26:35] stuff yet like the hard stuff that I
[05:26:37] haven't done in cbt2 too so that'll come
[05:26:39] soon but I do like it if I didn't like
[05:26:41] it I would end stream after the sponsor
[05:26:43] segment but I'm still streaming it okay
[05:26:59] business is this the Delo guide guy how
[05:27:01] is that what I'm known by
[05:27:04] as Anthony carpit thanks for the prime
[05:27:15] have you faced any bugs me personally
[05:27:17] only one
[05:27:20] uh I I know there are some because it's
[05:27:22] a new game and that's it's fine like I
[05:27:25] know some people have had trouble
[05:27:27] like like logging in and [ __ ] but it you
[05:27:31] know to be fair because I'm a fair man I
[05:27:36] remember day one genin you couldn't
[05:27:38] install the game it took too long so I
[05:27:39] started playing like day
[05:27:49] two oh I can rotate it's fine I got
[05:27:55] it extra
[05:28:01] supplies extra supplies
[05:28:13] Target confirmed misery
[05:28:19] follows ready for battle but yeah I
[05:28:22] think like
[05:28:26] break okay like honestly like full like
[05:28:30] my full take is like I think if you're a
[05:28:31] wa player you're winning because the
[05:28:33] devs seem to really care and like are
[05:28:35] passionate about it from what I've seen
[05:28:36] and are trying to make a good game and
[05:28:38] if you're a genin player you're also
[05:28:39] winning cuz either you can try another
[05:28:40] game or even if you don't
[05:28:42] care realistically genin is probably
[05:28:44] going to be a bit scared and give us
[05:28:45] more stuff so like I think both games
[05:28:47] are
[05:28:49] winning and if you're any know for Star
[05:28:51] rail players me too you know I play all
[05:28:52] three [ __ ] you cuz you got Dr ratio and
[05:28:54] I'm still mad at you I'm just kidding
[05:28:56] like you know I don't even need to
[05:28:58] explain why you're winning
[05:29:11] freest office POG yeah
[05:29:23] yeah I remember doing this in
[05:29:27] beta but I remember [ __ ] it up and
[05:29:29] not remembering what to do and I think I
[05:29:30] just [ __ ] it up again okay which one
[05:29:32] do I have to connect first okay let me
[05:29:34] grab this we'll connect this way and
[05:29:37] then then I need a a thing for
[05:29:45] that no way the [ __ ] mortify coffee
[05:29:48] pasta is
[05:29:50] here true though he is the shanglin of
[05:29:53] this game I want to play him but I don't
[05:29:55] want to bench calaro what do I
[05:29:57] do bots maybe I bench Karo but not bench
[05:30:00] but put him in the other team is that a
[05:30:01] better way of saying it
[05:30:12] with that said though take this with a
[05:30:13] grain of salt because I remember
[05:30:15] [ __ ] in Star rail saying suang
[05:30:18] was the [ __ ] Shang Ling of star rail
[05:30:22] however this time Z Jeff said it so I
[05:30:24] believe it
[05:30:28] more eventually it became QQ and I agree
[05:30:31] QQ is great no no I agree cuu is great
[05:30:33] although not as great as Shang Ling but
[05:30:35] I digress she is great no one said that
[05:30:38] you weren't there you actually weren't
[05:30:40] there I'm not saying it was credible
[05:30:41] people I'm saying people said that
[05:30:43] silverwolf has been called the Kazu of
[05:30:45] genin uh
[05:30:46] star people still going that
[05:30:51] sorry sorry
[05:30:55] sorry what am I doing dude what the [ __ ]
[05:30:57] am I
[05:31:02] doing
[05:31:04] yep can I unconnect the other one or no
[05:31:08] like can I unplug this one now cuz I did
[05:31:10] it
[05:31:11] already I I don't remember it's been a
[05:31:13] while since I did
[05:31:15] this oh my god dude T
[05:31:29] okay but like obviously I don't I don't
[05:31:32] [ __ ] fault anyone for not knowing
[05:31:33] everything when the game started I
[05:31:35] didn't know meshing cogs was good like
[05:31:36] you know I [ __ ] I didn't know
[05:31:38] harbinger of Dawn was good in genin it
[05:31:40] is what it
[05:31:41] is but I'm also like I have a phob dude
[05:31:44] like I dude like I have yeah I I try not
[05:31:47] to talk much until I know [ __ ] though
[05:31:49] cuz but that's not a good way to do
[05:31:51] content because then even though you're
[05:31:53] credible you get like significantly less
[05:31:55] views because you're not just yapping
[05:31:56] out of your ass however you know uh I am
[05:32:01] a
[05:32:03] yapper what the [ __ ] is
[05:32:06] happening oh I
[05:32:08] see wait no I don't why
[05:32:11] is oh I see so I probably want to do
[05:32:15] that now
[05:32:25] right no this does nothing what the [ __ ]
[05:32:27] does this do
[05:32:32] nothing does it does this do
[05:32:35] anything feel like this doesn't do [ __ ]
[05:32:41] I've already done this dude I did this
[05:32:42] in the beta I just forgot what I
[05:32:51] did oh
[05:32:55] okay I'm stupid
[05:33:02] caught all right [ __ ] it I'm giving
[05:33:04] someone a GN [ __ ] you I'm bored okay
[05:33:07] should I just PayPal money or should I
[05:33:09] log in and pull the only problem with

[06:00:16] folder you input the numbers on postal
[06:00:18] code and then put Z two Z it
[06:00:21] works in the worst case you can just
[06:00:23] like run away to Cuba right I'm not I'm
[06:00:28] not doing
[06:00:34] that wait let me try this one
[06:00:40] second John weing isn't going to sue you
[06:00:43] for using the wrong ZIP code cuz I think
[06:00:46] it's to calculate sales
[06:00:53] [Music]
[06:00:54] tax what if you just commit fraud I
[06:00:57] don't want to commit fraud
[06:01:06] sure you don't
[06:01:10] buddy dude I've been I've been watching
[06:01:12] byy you know what Bucky is yeah yeah
[06:01:15] I've never watched it but I see Random
[06:01:16] clips of it on Twitter it's so
[06:01:21] funny is it it really is what even is
[06:01:26] baky it's like really buff men yeah I
[06:01:31] know that
[06:01:33] fighting and then
[06:01:37] they
[06:01:39] just one of them wins based on which one
[06:01:42] it's funnier for for for them to win and
[06:01:46] then the narrator justifies it
[06:01:49] somehow it works but I okay I if I paid
[06:01:53] the wrong taxes I'll pay more I promise
[06:01:55] I don't have no issue paying an extra
[06:01:57] $100 you can have it you can have it IRS
[06:01:59] you can have it I I I put a postal code
[06:02:01] that put a sales tax that's pretty you
[06:02:03] know reasonable um but like it wouldn't
[06:02:06] let me put my real postal
[06:02:11] code but I paid with PayPal and PayPal
[06:02:14] has my information so it should be
[06:02:17] fine by the way okay I just I just want
[06:02:20] to like save this for the record okay
[06:02:24] tiia is [ __ ] awful and I I cannot why
[06:02:28] did they Nerf her this who's
[06:02:32] that really why did it nerve her this
[06:02:34] much man she's so so bad now okay Dam I
[06:02:38] I don't know the only thing okay I made
[06:02:40] a like which five star should pick video
[06:02:41] did anything get invalidated I feel like
[06:02:43] everything's the same except they nerfed
[06:02:44] a few got nerfed by like so much yeah
[06:02:47] but they also nerfed the other ones
[06:02:49] except not as much like he he's the one
[06:02:52] who got the biggest hit oh
[06:02:54] really well I saw the numbers but it's
[06:02:57] like every single part of his kid is
[06:03:00] down by somewhere between like 10 and
[06:03:02] 40% it's so bad really
[06:03:06] [ __ ] is he less recommended I mean he's
[06:03:09] still good right yeah I mean he's still
[06:03:11] good because like re realistically he
[06:03:13] was actually far ahead enough that like
[06:03:15] yeah like he was better than GN is what
[06:03:17] people are saying I don't know if that's
[06:03:18] true but like he was
[06:03:19] like let's say competitive but that
[06:03:22] doesn't necessarily mean he's better you
[06:03:24] can take num from your
[06:03:28] post his damage is like it lingers and
[06:03:31] does damage over like two seconds or
[06:03:34] whatever but like the just move away
[06:03:36] from that if they were like really
[06:03:38] really fancy
[06:03:40] bosses okay but I still think he's he's
[06:03:42] okay he's probably a good DPS now went
[06:03:44] not ahead of the others as ahead this
[06:03:47] probably still the same
[06:03:49] stuff uh but I guess enor Encore got
[06:03:51] nerfed a little
[06:03:53] right I saw that but I I I didn't really
[06:03:56] look
[06:03:58] at I didn't know [ __ ] about her before
[06:04:01] she might be better than h no I don't
[06:04:04] think she's better but she was she was
[06:04:06] not like she was pretty good
[06:04:08] before is the definite aquarium kind of
[06:04:11] nothing happened to her lingyang got
[06:04:13] buffed massively dude I was playing him
[06:04:15] he felt a lot smoother but I can't tell
[06:04:16] if that was
[06:04:19] copium I think it was no no like I think
[06:04:22] he does feel dude I played like at least
[06:04:24] 20 hours on him before in
[06:04:27] beta
[06:04:33] Co when was the death start wa stream

[06:06:26] none there is what well there was one
[06:06:29] but it's like leaks I'm not going on the

[06:07:30] accurate wait that's the data mind stuff
[06:07:33] I think with lingang his numbers didn't
[06:07:36] change too much but he might have
[06:07:37] changed a lot of Animation stuff yeah
[06:07:39] like I played him on every time I played
[06:07:42] him he felt better but I can't tell if I
[06:07:44] just got better at the game I don't
[06:07:45] think I did there there is like a few
[06:07:48] number changes but yeah like it
[06:07:50] it it might just be animation changes do

[06:46:26] control alt delete and then click like
[06:46:28] log out and then it would start or shut
[06:46:31] down it start closing things and then I
[06:46:32] would cancel to come back when the game
[06:46:33] is closed but like that would probably
[06:46:35] disconnect the stream and I don't want
[06:46:36] to do
[06:46:37] that c clicking on Tab once you're on

[07:23:27] everything from faade
[07:23:31] level up calaro please honestly yeah I
[07:23:33] don't think I'll regret it cuz I'm going
[07:23:34] to use it with yinin and eventually I'll
[07:23:35] use him anyways even if right now it's
[07:23:37] not that efficient [ __ ] it we're going
[07:23:38] to do it oh I didn't I [ __ ] up no I
[07:23:41] was mid animation fine I dodge
[07:23:47] it tell truth from
[07:23:49] the war spares no one you get a five
[07:23:53] star after GN okay we got Calo then Jen
[07:23:55] and now we're guaranteed this is hurting
[07:23:57] my ears it's not like bad but I just
[07:23:59] feel like it's a little too loud um
[07:24:00] we're guaranteed a five star in the next
[07:24:02] 10 P so we're going to do that um I
[07:24:06] think at level 15 we're we'll get the
[07:24:11] pulls commence
[07:24:18] healing I don't use my ALT here like a
[07:24:24] waste f
[07:24:37] [ __ ] almost
[07:24:41] seven so confused what to do well I have
[07:24:43] a quick start guide coming out I'm just
[07:24:44] waiting but it's done it's fully
[07:24:46] recorded okay but it's the same Basics
[07:24:50] like a lot of the same stuff that
[07:24:52] applies in many games like follow the
[07:24:53] quest you have to do your data Bank
[07:24:55] though in this game like focus on Echo
[07:24:57] quite a bit let me see if my um this is
[07:25:00] Battle pass I can claim it the day
[07:25:01] resets in an hour I think so I got to
[07:25:04] make sure I do stuff
[07:25:12] um okay one more level when we get this
[07:25:14] [ __ ] uh guide book let me make sure I'm
[07:25:17] doing
[07:25:18] this nice stage two
[07:25:21] done all right stage
[07:25:27] three oh we unlock the main quest
[07:25:36] bet
[07:25:38] cool oh we leveled our data Bank let's
[07:25:41] [ __ ]
[07:25:46] go is Karo or gien better with Yin okay
[07:25:50] hhhh I know Karo and yland synergize
[07:25:53] well
[07:25:54] together but I'm not a master of their
[07:25:57] kits I know C like you can kind of not
[07:25:59] spend the most time on y if you don't
[07:26:00] want to which is why you can do that but
[07:26:03] I know Karo like I was seeing stuff
[07:26:05] about how he Buffs Electro damage but
[07:26:06] that's only with [ __ ] constellation
[07:26:07] so I don't think that matters right it's
[07:26:09] only this but that's [ __ ] like you're
[07:26:10] not getting C3 so I'm not actually uh I
[07:26:13] know they synergize well together but
[07:26:16] I'm not like fully until I get to play
[07:26:18] her I'm not fully aware of like
[07:26:21] why I just know she has like she can be
[07:26:24] used she cannot spend that much time on
[07:26:27] field and then you can swap into him but
[07:26:29] I didn't get get her like I didn't I
[07:26:30] haven't really played
[07:26:33] her I'm still learning I'm still
[07:26:40] learning she Buffs electron outro oh
[07:26:43] maybe that's it okay yeah that makes
[07:26:44] sense
[07:26:50] then uh let me write something down
[07:27:04] 20
[07:27:09] of have you experienced any bugs yeah I
[07:27:13] have uh but not as much as I've heard
[07:27:15] some other people
[07:27:17] have why do you still have those time
[07:27:21] stamps let me uh either do some new
[07:27:24] bosses or do the quest I want to make
[07:27:26] sure I do some stamina spending so let's
[07:27:29] go
[07:27:36] H I need to spend resin for these right
[07:27:40] or souvenir store I
[07:27:46] guess Target area locked e

[07:28:34] it this is terrible never mind what the
[07:28:37] [ __ ] I picked the worst five star it's

[07:32:35] and I'm about to get a third five star

[07:32:49] level 15 so that I can get the
[07:32:53] PS let make sure I want to spend some
[07:32:55] resin though so uh let's go do
[07:33:00] I guess I'm investing in calaro too
[07:33:02] right eventually so maybe I should go do
[07:33:04] the mats for that or the weapon I need
[07:33:07] to do these right I don't know how many
[07:33:09] I can get from the souvenir

[07:33:51] Glide you think monthly sh we should get
[07:33:53] all 18 wishes
[07:33:56] um I think the answer is yes yes unless
[07:34:00] you won't be able to buy the next
[07:34:01] month's limiteds like you prioritize
[07:34:03] limited and then probably limited weapon
[07:34:05] and then standard but if you can't get
[07:34:06] all of them then you have to choose
[07:34:10] depends how much you
[07:34:15] pull
[07:34:20] fin although getting the standard ones
[07:34:22] like right now is probably worth it to
[07:34:24] help you get through the get like your
[07:34:26] guaranteed [ __ ]
[07:34:31] tell truth why this guy

[07:36:11] honestly will you judge me or
[07:36:13] no how did it go anyone SP let me check
[07:36:16] on
[07:36:18] you so Rover you going to try yep okay
[07:36:21] then I refuse to answer lar disc
[07:36:23] represent time and we need to align the
[07:36:27] correct symbol with this pointer
[07:36:38] it's working and now symbols on the
[07:36:41] smaller desk represent direction we have
[07:36:44] te long of the East I
[07:36:49] cool it's not
[07:36:58] working well you really solved
[07:37:03] it wait I don't think it's something
[07:37:05] we're allowed to see Quicky we should
[07:37:08] turn
[07:37:10] around come on just go ahead and see
[07:37:12] what's written
[07:37:24] inside I see the grand libraries in hang
[07:37:28] long are re
[07:37:30] what character that matter uh uh uh
[07:37:32] Verina or DPS I can't tell how good
[07:37:35] lingang is now anymore I think he's
[07:37:37] better I think he's viable kind of like
[07:37:40] AIG piggy bank yes you will find the if
[07:37:45] you need to visit the Grand library in
[07:37:47] Jing first there is a second you must
[07:37:52] be important toing wow we stumbled upon
[07:37:57] a real big shot when we didn't even know
[07:38:02] what's the matter Rover something wrong
[07:38:05] it is jeno's political Center and it's
[07:38:08] also located the city hall was built
[07:38:10] when was estblished
[07:38:13] goodover oh wait Jon is the the [ __ ]
[07:38:16] Sage girl right never mind uh kind of
[07:38:20] come on Yang it's just a oneon-one
[07:38:22] meeting with Rel she's cool but she's
[07:38:25] kind of like she has a six-year
[07:38:26] animation so it's hard to like evaluate
[07:38:28] her efficiently
[07:38:31] like she she does a lot of things in one
[07:38:33] she has like grouping she has [ __ ]
[07:38:35] some small Buffs she has a shield she
[07:38:37] has some healing when you to the active
[07:38:38] character but you have like a long
[07:38:40] clunky animation to get it and she can
[07:38:42] Parry like she's kind of a tank I think
[07:38:44] she's going to be able to solo some
[07:38:45] content but I think her damage is like
[07:38:46] kind of whatever realistically you
[07:38:48] probably swap out of her but I think she
[07:38:51] works
[07:38:53] fine I don't hover her though
[07:38:57] sge s
[07:39:10] balls so in two months appreciate it
[07:39:17] balls tank like de no she feels more
[07:39:21] like if you're playing her on field she
[07:39:23] feels more noell Clara E but like
[07:39:29] I feel like you're probably swapping
[07:39:31] like I don't
[07:39:34] know the [ __ ] am I doing I'll move the
[07:39:36] phases
[07:40:07] start C is still
[07:40:10] good not sure about the Reddit mod I
[07:40:12] think he's fine makes three months aboba
[07:40:16] oh this thing I remember this [ __ ] of
[07:40:19] build to the puzzle moment
[07:40:22] hypers underwater
[07:40:31] the general DPS support sustain not
[07:40:33] really must one healing is sometimes not
[07:40:35] needed if you're doing content that one
[07:40:37] shot to you supports are kind of not
[07:40:39] like some of them are real some of them
[07:40:40] are not real like sometimes you have two
[07:40:42] DPSS and just swap like quick swap
[07:40:44] between them and cycle your DPS stuff
[07:40:46] like intro outro spam you can also run
[07:40:49] like usually
[07:40:51] it's yeah if you have characters that
[07:40:53] require low fi time with one that
[07:40:55] requires a lot of fi time it can
[07:40:57] work I don't think there's a set formula
[07:41:00] but
[07:41:14] I but having a Healer is nice for most
[07:41:16] content like it's
[07:41:18] comfy it's just if you're doing stuff
[07:41:20] where eventually like if you're doing
[07:41:22] stuff where you get one shot then the
[07:41:23] Healer well verina's still broken cuz
[07:41:25] she Buffs you
[07:41:27] but just the healing is kind of uh it
[07:41:29] becomes less relevant un less
[07:41:33] [Music]
[07:41:36] needed yo s thanks what you gifted is

[07:55:01] tokens for you okay please pardon my
[07:55:03] lack of
[07:55:07] hospitality yes the Sentinel of Jingo is
[07:55:11] currently
[07:55:13] absent correct the sentinel's guide and
[07:55:17] guard humanity is a symbol of our
[07:55:19] civilization okay when a region Sentinel
[07:55:22] goes absent chaos is bound to
[07:55:25] ensue as this news could lead to civil
[07:55:28] unrest please keep it a secret Jing
[07:55:32] joo's Sentinel Jer is being held captive
[07:55:34] by the
[07:55:36] fraxus I had to postpone our meeting and
[07:55:39] put all my effort into finding its way
[07:55:42] blue yes I can't thoughts are connected
[07:55:45] to a certain degree I can sense his
[07:55:48] memories feelings and
[07:55:50] surroundings though not very
[07:55:56] clearly have you found it yet
[07:55:58] unfortunately I haven't I can feel J is
[07:56:02] in
[07:56:03] danger the good news is I have figured
[07:56:06] out the culprit behind all of
[07:56:08] this the fraus plans to advance another
[07:56:11] lament cause disasters worldwide
[07:56:14] overseer scar had several objectives
[07:56:16] upon infiltrating
[07:56:19] Jingo to track you down to test your
[07:56:22] strengths and to make you join their
[07:56:24] cause to abduct J and to resurrect the
[07:56:27] thodi in
[07:56:29] advance why me they must have discovered
[07:56:32] your value likely from one of J's
[07:56:36] prophecies if you join them they'll gain
[07:56:39] significant power should you refuse to
[07:56:42] join the fraxus will likely want to
[07:56:43] eliminate you so you don't get in their
[07:56:47] way
[07:56:49] okay neutral
[07:56:51] face I have a plan to apprehend scar
[07:56:55] once we capture him the fraus won't be
[07:56:58] that much of a threat to you for the

[08:17:53] okay I was going to bring food down but
[08:17:55] instead I shoveled food into my mouth
[08:18:16] hello okay sorry I was
[08:18:20] yapping is Gianna musle no move on next
[08:18:24] question sorry that was that was toxic
[08:18:26] he's my favorite character not a mus
[08:18:27] pull no G no game in no character in any
[08:18:30] gacha game is going to be a mus pull or
[08:18:31] the game is [ __ ] dog [ __ ] I'm sorry
[08:18:33] if there's a character that's a mus pull
[08:18:34] and a gacha game in order to clear
[08:18:35] something the game [ __ ] sucks so to
[08:18:37] my understanding he is not a
[08:18:41] musle Kazo Kazo is not a musle close
[08:18:45] pretty close he's great high
[08:18:48] value arguably less valuable than nitaa
[08:18:50] though but that's a conversation for
[08:18:52] another day
[08:19:08] anyways it is now time to get our
[08:19:20] second second five star standard well
[08:19:23] standard five star second standard five
[08:19:24] star we have gan
[08:19:27] uh we have
[08:19:29] calaro so getting another one would be
[08:19:31] annoying hopefully that doesn't
[08:19:33] happen uh ideally we get either Verina
[08:19:36] as just a good healer or Encore because
[08:19:38] I think she's cool Jen Shin would be
[08:19:42] cool I kind of want to test some things
[08:19:44] with her it's
[08:19:46] fine maybe benched maybe not
[08:19:50] benched Ling
[08:19:52] Yang is who I got as my first five star
[08:19:55] in the beta and who I ended up Ming in
[08:19:58] the beta cuz I didn't get any other DPS
[08:20:01] uh well five star and I lost my
[08:20:04] 50/50 uh he was fun but felt clunky but
[08:20:08] apparently he became less clunky in the
[08:20:11] live game I think I'm trying to confirm
[08:20:14] so if that's true then I wouldn't be mad
[08:20:17] by getting him either however I do have
[08:20:19] two good DPSS right now uh so I don't
[08:20:23] know Verina or aore would be like top
[08:20:26] PRI for me if not jent and lingang are
[08:20:29] fine calaro dup would be
[08:20:34] annoying cuz I'm not going to activate
[08:20:35] the constellation all right let's
[08:20:38] go guaranteed five star character number
[08:20:43] two who will we
[08:20:46] get that's good fourar weapon we take
[08:20:49] that okay any bonus four star is nice
[08:21:03] please please please please something
[08:21:05] good something good opening greeting
[08:21:08] foul Spirits be gone all safe and
[08:21:17] sound
[08:21:19] twice both beginner
[08:21:22] banners twice
[08:21:28] two beginner banners in a
[08:21:32] row so when is the gaming
[08:21:39] guide but he's cute colon
[08:21:49] three it's fine it's not that
[08:21:53] bad like it's fine I don't know if I'm
[08:21:56] going to use him but uh it's
[08:22:03] fine it it's better than a second Karo
[08:22:06] because I already have
[08:22:08] one but outside of that is probably the
[08:22:11] worst option for
[08:22:13] me
[08:22:16] well gauntlets
[08:22:32] oh you can change anytime [ __ ] it
[08:22:42] lingyang oh I see this how this works
[08:22:44] okay
[08:22:52] cool I don't like looking at Verina
[08:22:58] I like looking at Jan Shin but I kind of
[08:23:01] want um sheep girl
[08:23:06] more I don't
[08:23:08] know I would choose him if Oh my
[08:23:12] Jesus I would choose him if I didn't
[08:23:14] have him but I have him so hey rip Bozo
[08:23:17] okay we'll
[08:23:21] see looking
[08:23:28] break okay let me
[08:23:33] um
[08:23:38] fine holy thighs flush why did I read
[08:23:43] that let me make sure he actually does
[08:23:45] feel better cuz I'm pretty sure he
[08:23:49] does take this
[08:24:02] how do you feel this compares to solo
[08:24:04] leveling
[08:24:06] arise okay look um welcome to the stream
[08:24:10] first time chatter uh I have never
[08:24:12] played solo leveling arise in my
[08:24:14] life no disrespect I mean you know I
[08:24:17] just haven't you know I haven't played
[08:24:22] it yeah like look the pillars he walks
[08:24:24] on are different they used to be like
[08:24:25] little like smaller
[08:24:29] things
[08:24:30] yay this is my Curtain Call an anime not
[08:24:34] a game it is a game I mean it's an anime
[08:24:36] but it's also a game there's
[08:24:40] both watch
[08:24:43] out solo leveling is Anime ill and then
[08:24:46] I think arise is the
[08:24:51] game oh yeah that that little step I
[08:24:54] found really clunky and very annoying
[08:24:56] but it
[08:24:57] seems
[08:25:05] better let's play hide and
[08:25:12] seek Gil storm he's such a nerd
[08:25:18] true that's curtains for you that's
[08:25:21] curtains for you Lions Rumble evil
[08:25:24] crumble
[08:25:33] how's that like he does feel
[08:25:42] better let's play hide and
[08:25:48] seek yay
[08:25:58] this is my Curtain
[08:26:06] Call I'm trying to see if he feels
[08:26:08] clunky still but it it it definitely
[08:26:10] feels better like look at that I don't
[08:26:17] know he's all right I do think he feels
[08:26:20] better than before so if you like him I
[08:26:22] don't think he's like bad anymore like
[08:26:25] cbt2 I kind of was not a big fan I think
[08:26:28] he feels better but it could also be
[08:26:32] Placebo I'm trying to figure that
[08:26:35] out check his Idol one if it's if it's
[08:26:40] not worth my time you're

[08:28:18] am not hearing you out it's a [ __ ]

[08:28:40] you
[08:28:43] can
[08:28:45] boom say bye to breathing boom okay okay
[08:28:48] why am I doing this why am I doing this
[08:28:49] why am I doing this shut up shut don't
[08:28:50] talk to me don't talk to me okay uh
[08:28:53] uhh you can but you have so you have
[08:28:56] chance to get them and then if you don't
[08:28:57] get them you can choose them here your
[08:28:58] beginner thing well even if you get them
[08:29:00] you can choose them but you have to do
[08:29:01] 80 PS for
[08:29:02] it so it'll be more of a long-term
[08:29:20] thing oh you can only do 10 PS on this
[08:29:22] Banner you can't even single that's
[08:29:23] crazy
[08:29:31] which one's the best probably Vina but
[08:29:33] uh Karo is also a good DPS and so is the
[08:29:36] Encore
[08:29:50] girl how do I optimize my waa uh I'm not
[08:29:54] exactly sure and I I assume the devs are
[08:29:56] going to make more optimizations to the
[08:29:58] game however uh I recommend vsync
[08:30:01] off and
[08:30:04] uh this isn't for optimization but it
[08:30:06] looks ugly if you don't motion blur off
[08:30:09] I'm not sure about the other stuff
[08:30:10] that's important there's probably some
[08:30:11] other [ __ ] to turn off
[08:30:15] too you can just turn your graphics
[08:30:17] lower obviously but there's definitely
[08:30:19] like I think some people have had
[08:30:21] problems with just like it's like laggy
[08:30:23] or high ping or trouble logging in I
[08:30:25] think that's just like it'll get better
[08:30:27] as within hopefully like a day days I
[08:30:33] don't know I don't work there
[08:30:40] hopefully clu this
[08:30:57] what do you mean you don't work there I
[08:30:59] saw you
[08:31:00] there
[08:31:05] God
[08:31:12] fck it's
[08:31:16] time no the day reset wait did I do
[08:31:19] everything I did dailies I I mean I
[08:31:20] didn't spam refresh but like I'm not

[08:43:58] how many go games are you actively
[08:43:59] playing uh oh yo why would you ask me
[08:44:02] that that's like asking a a
[08:44:06] um that's like asking a a an at no
[08:44:10] what's a good comparison that's like
[08:44:13] asking
[08:44:21] uh I don't know
[08:44:30] I trust you can use it to the
[08:44:33] full hello what am I doing I thought I
[08:44:35] had my
[08:44:39] grappling I thought I had
[08:44:42] my it's fine there's a wayp point
[08:44:46] here I thought I my grappling hook dude
[08:44:48] I thought my grappling hook I thought my
[08:44:50] grappling hook
[08:44:56] yes it's like asking an actor how many
[08:44:58] films they're in
[08:45:01] exactly I mean this is
[08:45:03] the yeah this is the elevator
[08:45:11] anyways you linked me an imer an imer
[08:45:16] link to show
[08:45:19] me
[08:45:22] this you know what
[08:45:25] I'm choosing um what's the opposite of
[08:45:28] violence I'm choosing kindness today
[08:45:29] congratulations I'm happy for you good
[08:45:32] characters I hope you enjoy your time
[08:45:35] weathering the waves no I'm happy for
[08:45:37] you I am no I
[08:45:39] am look now if my mods decide to ban you
[08:45:42] that's not on me that's not on me mods
[08:45:45] your salary will be doubled if you ban
[08:45:46] that guy but I'm happy for
[08:45:49] you yeah 2 * 0 is still zero but it's
[08:45:53] like a bigger zero like some infinities
[08:45:55] are bigger than other infinities yeah
[08:45:57] Infinity is just Infinity but like
[08:45:59] there's the amount of Infinities between
[08:46:01] zero and one the amount of numbers
[08:46:02] between zero and one is infinite right
[08:46:04] because it's decimals but the amount of
[08:46:05] numbers between zero and two is a bigger
[08:46:08] infinity it's still infinite but there's
[08:46:09] the 0o to one and there's also the one
[08:46:11] to two you know just so you know all
[08:46:13] good
[08:46:21] okay no they're the same size [ __ ] you
[08:46:25] don't correct
[08:46:28] me let me be
[08:46:33] wrong okay okay okay okay I know
[08:46:36] infinity infinity means like okay okay
[08:46:38] it's like you can count forever okay I
[08:46:40] get it countable Infinity you you just
[08:46:42] go forever and it never stops I get it
[08:46:44] but like dude some infinities are just
[08:46:46] bigger than others like you can't argue
[08:46:47] with me like I know I know
[08:46:49] mathematically infinity is infinity but
[08:46:51] like dude there's an Infinity in an
[08:46:53] Infinity if if 0 to one there's infinite
[08:46:55] numbers then 0 to 10 million like
[08:46:58] between 0 and 10 million there's also
[08:46:59] infinite numbers which is the same thing
[08:47:01] but it's not the same thing cuz there's
[08:47:02] multiple Infinities within the first
[08:47:04] infin the the bigger Infinities time
[08:47:07] okay please stop talking no I am here to
[08:47:10] ruin an entire
[08:47:12] generation and then your teacher is
[08:47:14] going to be like where did you learn
[08:47:15] this and then you're going to have to
[08:47:18] explain see what's great is I don't know
[08:47:20] if I'm right or wrong but it doesn't
[08:47:22] matter but I can't Yap like that about
[08:47:24] like weaing waves or genin or Star rail
[08:47:27] cuz then it's misinformation but about
[08:47:28] [ __ ] math if you trust me if you're
[08:47:30] trusting me on this that's on you also I
[08:47:33] got stuck on this for like an hour and
[08:47:34] then I gave up in cbt2 I remember I was
[08:47:37] like what the [ __ ] do I have to do and
[08:47:38] then I G like for here I found the
[08:47:39] battery and for the second one I
[08:47:42] didn't oh wait they're both here never
[08:47:44] mind okay I maybe I didn't get stuck
[08:47:47] here I don't remember I got stuck
[08:47:49] somewhere here for a little bit maybe it
[08:47:52] was this maybe it wasn't Why is my T not
[08:47:55] working t
[08:48:09] t okay never mind I pretty sure I just
[08:48:11] didn't see the second battery and I was
[08:48:12] looking for it
[08:48:20] here as a math major that is true thank
[08:48:24] you
[08:48:25] Keel thank
[08:48:34] you Andre take already ruined the
[08:48:37] generation enough we don't need the
[08:48:39] generation to be mathematically
[08:48:42] challenged bro you act like we like we
[08:48:45] already aren't mathematically challenged
[08:48:55] it's
[08:48:58] time do do you guys see there's a clip
[08:49:01] of
[08:49:02] like like a like a [ __ ] like primary
[08:49:05] school teacher that had to use not had
[08:49:08] to but like was like I used the [ __ ]
[08:49:11] Phantom tax to explain math to my first
[08:49:14] graders it's over it's actually over
[08:49:40] did you see I'm not even what the [ __ ]
[08:49:43] is I'm not even reading that actually

[08:50:48] conflicting info and then it's like
[08:50:49] impossible to decipher but
[08:50:53] like so like I'm saying this because
[08:50:55] someone asked me a question in chat and

[09:09:40] this I don't know how I make this though
[09:09:42] I guess that's my next
[09:09:47] spot okay cool uh then we go there pog
[09:10:04] nice we made it oh there's not even like
[09:10:07] a waypoint here so I don't know how I'm
[09:10:08] going to get back
[09:10:17] F FG
[09:10:24] no
[09:10:28] Echo wait is this boss
[09:10:30] under I thought it there's no way I
[09:10:33] climbed this whole Mountain for nothing
[09:10:35] and nobody told
[09:10:42] me no one no no one thought to tell
[09:10:49] me wait is he actually [ __ ] under I
[09:10:52] might as get the stuff that's here right
[09:10:54] there's oh I missed an
[09:11:02] echo how the hell would we know okay
[09:11:04] fair enough I
[09:11:06] guess let me turn the music down a bit
[09:11:08] cuz we're playing music
[09:11:11] okay wait how do
[09:11:14] I wait so where the [ __ ] is it oh I
[09:11:17] guess that's why the Waypoint is under
[09:11:18] maybe you like walk
[09:11:20] under cuz why else would there be no
[09:11:22] Waypoint Point next to it like there
[09:11:24] wouldn't be no Waypoint next to
[09:11:26] it whatever [ __ ]
[09:11:41] it
[09:11:47] um I'm so confused though maybe I'll
[09:11:49] just go to the Waypoint first let me
[09:11:51] figure out where this Waypoint is
[09:11:56] uh is it up here feel like it might be
[09:12:01] here oh that flip was cool it's kind of
[09:12:04] wicked but now I'm climbing back up I
[09:12:07] don't really want to climb back up go
[09:12:08] from the South
[09:12:11] Side that's what I I thought that's what
[09:12:13] I
[09:12:14] did that's I got distracted wait let me
[09:12:16] get the wayo first
[09:12:21] though it says it's still down
[09:12:26] huh
[09:12:28] okay wait wait what why did that happen
[09:12:31] now
[09:12:41] whatever so
[09:12:44] it's it's like this way but it says
[09:12:49] under I'm so lost
[09:12:56] why does this game do that it like
[09:12:58] pushes you backwards sometimes I don't
[09:12:59] understand yeah it's probably down I
[09:13:01] think it's I I mean I know I unlocked
[09:13:03] this Waypoint last time but I don't
[09:13:04] remember how I'm pretty sure you just
[09:13:06] like run under this thing but I kind of
[09:13:07] don't want to jump down again I'm going
[09:13:08] to jump down
[09:13:12] again is it like all the way down
[09:13:23] go into the hole yeah
[09:13:26] maybe wait which
[09:13:30] hole feel like it's definitely under
[09:13:51] something the [ __ ] is this thing
[09:14:01] hello all right anyways I feel like I'm
[09:14:02] just wasting
[09:14:04] time let's go from
[09:14:08] here I just wasted like 5
[09:14:11] minutes let me navigate to the proper
[09:14:13] thing
[09:14:28] uh boom
[09:14:32] wait
[09:14:34] boom what the [ __ ] this

[09:14:50] goes [ __ ] I didn't rotate it
[09:14:57] boom chest thank
[09:15:02] you down in the middle thing yeah that
[09:15:05] makes sense I guess and like the
[09:15:06] elevator just elevator down for the
[09:15:10] Waypoint so this thing says it's under
[09:15:13] which means you probably walk like
[09:15:15] through
[09:15:18] here let me try to do that
[09:15:28] we watched you stall for two hours did I
[09:15:29] stall for two hours I feel like I didn't

[09:16:06] nothing let me open this
[09:16:12] menu wonder which one I should do
[09:16:23] search I mean I'm pretty sure we just go

[09:16:26] run down
[09:16:29] there no can't you just elevat her down

[09:35:30] here the movement of this game is very
[09:35:33] like I don't know how to describe it it
[09:35:35] feels like turbo smooth but then
[09:35:36] sometimes you'll just like bug out and
[09:35:38] nothing will work and then you want to
[09:35:40] die it's like really satisfying but then
[09:35:43] sometimes it just doesn't
[09:35:45] work but I mean that's probably just cuz
[09:35:47] it's a new game
[09:36:04] no

[09:53:56] going to have to remake some parts given
[09:53:58] what changed since the game came out I
