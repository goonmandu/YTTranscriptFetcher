[00:15:31] daily stall we're going to do that
[00:15:33] um
[00:15:36] yeah I guess that's that
[00:15:39] um regarding like Anon donated one
[00:15:43] what's up Anon the internet exploded
[00:15:45] over the skin color ofan yeah that's
[00:15:47] actually probably I was going to talk
[00:15:48] about next even Chinese players are I
[00:15:51] was trying to get the unimportant stuff
[00:15:52] out of the way first yeah I saw that
[00:15:54] [ __ ] um I mean okay let me mute alerts
[00:15:57] if I talk about this then okay regard
[00:15:59] the the natland stuff I mean you guys
[00:16:00] know where I stand it's not like a
[00:16:02] secret I feel like the only people that
[00:16:03] don't know where I stand just don't
[00:16:04] watch my streams which is fine I don't
[00:16:05] expect everyone to watch my streams
[00:16:07] especially because I feel like my
[00:16:07] Twitter account is like growing on its
[00:16:10] own like why do I have 200 follow like 2
[00:16:12] 90k followers like who the why would you
[00:16:14] follow me [ __ ] you go away anyways but
[00:16:16] like like like so uh I'm gonna you know
[00:16:20] talk on on stream as well because I I
[00:16:22] feel like my normal stream viewers know
[00:16:24] what I stand uh for instance let's
[00:16:27] reiterate this when I watched the
[00:16:28] preview I I was like oh these characters
[00:16:30] you know I'm excited some of these
[00:16:31] characters look cool some I don't care
[00:16:32] for some look cool however obviously I
[00:16:35] think they ran out of the [ __ ] uh for
[00:16:36] some reason the the melanin gummies were
[00:16:39] out so that's why maybe they thought it
[00:16:41] was [ __ ] a melanin it was melatonin
[00:16:43] that's why that [ __ ] cat girl sleepy
[00:16:44] we we talked about you know I made a
[00:16:47] few passing comments but to reiterate
[00:16:49] obviously I wish there were more darker
[00:16:52] skinned characters and for people who
[00:16:53] care about representation uh you know I
[00:16:56] don't think I'm the [ __ ] uh what's
[00:16:59] the word for this like the best person
[00:17:01] at expressing my thoughts or or
[00:17:05] expressing how I think people should
[00:17:06] feel about things but obviously you know
[00:17:10] uh I do think two worlds exist however I
[00:17:12] think um it is cuz some people like oh
[00:17:14] but you're excited about this character
[00:17:15] yes like I can be like oh I like this
[00:17:17] character's design but you know I wish
[00:17:19] there was a bit better representation
[00:17:20] not a bit better A lot better you know
[00:17:22] that I think both those realities can
[00:17:24] coexist I see a character that looks
[00:17:26] like Shia to I'm like holy [ __ ] I love
[00:17:27] Shia to and then it's like oh well
[00:17:29] actually you know it's a
[00:17:31] misrepresentation oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] okay I
[00:17:33] you know maybe make them darker maybe
[00:17:35] you know do it a bit better I I I agree
[00:17:37] with that I agree with that but you know
[00:17:38] so I think those two realities can
[00:17:40] coexist um anyways so that's what I I
[00:17:44] mean I talked about that a bit um and
[00:17:47] other people have said whatever I could
[00:17:49] say but better um but it's not like yeah
[00:17:53] another thing is I say this a lot too
[00:17:56] that you can like things and criticize
[00:17:57] them at the same time it's kind of like
[00:17:59] the people like if I'm like man F okay
[00:18:01] I'm Canadian but pretend I'm American if
[00:18:03] I'm like man this part of America
[00:18:05] [ __ ] sucks and then they're like oh
[00:18:06] just leave it's like no [ __ ] you okay I
[00:18:08] can like something but still think that
[00:18:10] I don't like something okay [ __ ] you let
[00:18:12] me I'm not trying to [ __ ] get out
[00:18:14] okay I can be like oh this part of
[00:18:15] Canada [ __ ] sucks but I like Canada
[00:18:17] and oh go back to your country no [ __ ]
[00:18:19] you man [ __ ] you sorry sorry anyways uh
[00:18:22] so like that those are like my rough
[00:18:25] thoughts uh I learned about the olon
[00:18:27] thing too that's a bit well not a bit
[00:18:29] that's very cooked so
[00:18:32] um yeah yeah I saw a jef too he like
[00:18:35] posted the now
[00:18:38] screenshot should I pull it up I don't
[00:18:41] know maybe anyways so um yeah like
[00:18:45] that's that's that's like the the brief
[00:18:48] tldr uh I mean I've talked about it in
[00:18:50] like n uh not Nan in like like sumaru
[00:18:53] too like we talked about Dory and like
[00:18:55] the the pon stuff although I don't think
[00:18:56] the pon stuff is the same as the Dory
[00:18:58] thing but
[00:18:59] um you know we we talked about a bit I'm
[00:19:03] not it's weird cuz
[00:19:06] like I'm not someone who's like I don't
[00:19:10] know how to say this it's
[00:19:11] like I think it matters that if you're
[00:19:15] like yoing from a culture that it's
[00:19:16] accurately represented I think that's
[00:19:18] very
[00:19:19] important um however I don't know [ __ ]
[00:19:21] about
[00:19:22] anything like I remember people like
[00:19:24] some people not a lot of people I don't
[00:19:25] like being the one guy like one guy was
[00:19:27] mad at me so everyone was mad at me I
[00:19:28] hate those people they're like oh all of
[00:19:29] Twitter hates me dude [ __ ] you it's like
[00:19:31] two people and you're making a video on
[00:19:32] it like [ __ ] yourself but like you know
[00:19:34] when I when I first saw Dory I was like
[00:19:36] oh cool and then people like actually
[00:19:37] you know it's like a stereotype this
[00:19:38] this this like oh okay so maybe not cool
[00:19:40] like okay boom like okay I learned we're
[00:19:42] good but like some like but also I'm
[00:19:45] middle like I I don't even feel proper
[00:19:48] saying I'm Middle Eastern cuz my family
[00:19:50] is but like I mean I I'm Canadian but
[00:19:53] anyways like so like you know I get the
[00:19:55] pass cuz that's different but you know
[00:19:58] and then like the L was kind of cooked
[00:19:59] too so yeah but anyways um why is Dick
[00:20:04] stroker
[00:20:05] trending I kind of want to click
[00:20:09] it
[00:20:11] um yeah I think the thing is
[00:20:14] like just don't be stupid like if you
[00:20:18] don't care then let the people that care
[00:20:21] care like I think it's it's valid to be
[00:20:22] like H what like it doesn't affect me
[00:20:25] however it affects a lot of people and
[00:20:27] if those people see their own cultures
[00:20:29] being misrepresented then they have the
[00:20:30] right to speak up about it I think
[00:20:32] that's kind of a uh what am I trying to
[00:20:35] say I think that's a very valid
[00:20:37] take um which is kind of why I like what
[00:20:40] Fang said uh I don't know how she yapped
[00:20:43] this up but like you know I think this
[00:20:45] is pretty pretty fair so
[00:20:48] um that's me uh obviously uh like I make
[00:20:52] guides on every character I will
[00:20:54] continue to do so but it's not like you
[00:20:55] know like I don't pull for
[00:20:56] constellations or anything I'm not going
[00:20:57] to be like you need to spend obviously
[00:21:00] don't or you know but
[00:21:04] um yeah I just don't like when the
[00:21:06] argument like I feel like there's a very
[00:21:07] good faith argument of like hey like
[00:21:10] these cultures need better
[00:21:11] representation great I I just don't like
[00:21:14] when it gets like I feel like there's
[00:21:16] like two bad Avenues there's one where
[00:21:17] people are just like racist or like hey
[00:21:19] I'm like okay with every character being
[00:21:22] a you
[00:21:23] know Snow White and then there's the
[00:21:25] other argument where it's like oh well
[00:21:28] don't play the game then which I think
[00:21:29] is just you know wrong cuz like what the
[00:21:32] [ __ ] does that do like you just quit a
[00:21:34] game because like I feel like quitting
[00:21:36] doesn't do anything it's kind of like
[00:21:38] running away from a problem it's like if
[00:21:39] you're like hey I think this is bad okay
[00:21:42] then like criticize it ask for change
[00:21:44] you know don't spend or like send an
[00:21:45] email or whatever the [ __ ] but being
[00:21:47] like I'm going to uninstall like what
[00:21:49] does that do then the people that like I
[00:21:52] actually don't think it does anything
[00:21:53] unless literally everyone quits but
[00:21:55] that's not going to happen so I think
[00:21:56] that's just performative
[00:21:59] anyways um I I also don't like the
[00:22:02] people that like go after people just
[00:22:05] enjoying the game uh well that's not
[00:22:07] true actually it depends how like I
[00:22:10] don't like like obviously if if you see
[00:22:14] like hm if you're promoting something
[00:22:16] that's bad and harmful that's not good
[00:22:19] but if you're just like oh like I'm
[00:22:21] excited about this I think that's
[00:22:25] fair anyways
[00:22:31] um personally I think the best course of
[00:22:35] action is
[00:22:37] like how's quitting performative okay
[00:22:40] think like actually think about it take
[00:22:41] some time to think about it okay let's
[00:22:43] say you're like let's say everyone okay
[00:22:46] let me paint a world for you paint a
[00:22:48] world where everyone who cares about
[00:22:49] accurate representation quits then
[00:22:51] what's going to change okay they lose
[00:22:53] some player base and then everyone else
[00:22:55] just keeps playing and then the people
[00:22:57] that whale keep wailing like what
[00:22:59] happens after that I don't think much
[00:23:01] happens in my mind I could be wrong I
[00:23:04] think if you don't spend money stuff
[00:23:07] like that I think can matter I think if
[00:23:08] you like send an email or or do things
[00:23:11] that do like have an effect right like
[00:23:13] not spending money or like others I mean
[00:23:16] I can't really think of that much CU I'm
[00:23:17] an idiot but I think those things do
[00:23:19] more than just like oh what you built
[00:23:21] your career Off streaming genin just
[00:23:23] don't stream genin anymore
[00:23:24] what are you
[00:23:26] dumb anyways and I think
[00:23:30] like yeah but also like I you
[00:23:35] know as the as the model they based
[00:23:38] sumaru characters
[00:23:40] on like um you know it's not like I
[00:23:45] haven't talked about these things before
[00:23:47] but uh like there's a sumaru character
[00:23:49] like but for me it's like it's not why I
[00:23:55] um I don't know me I don't know how to
[00:23:58] say say this in like a nuanced way like
[00:23:59] I
[00:24:07] don't I care for the for the people who
[00:24:10] are affected by it but me it like and so
[00:24:13] because I see it affecting people
[00:24:14] negatively or people being bothered by
[00:24:17] it I care for it whereas at my base I'm
[00:24:19] just like oh I enjoy the combat and like
[00:24:20] I I close the game after like I'm not I
[00:24:22] don't like I literally only play genin
[00:24:24] when I have like a a focus I'm like okay
[00:24:26] I'm doing this on genin and then I get
[00:24:28] out
[00:24:29] anyways so that's that um we can move on
[00:24:35] now but hopefully they do
[00:24:37] better and I think if they don't um it
[00:24:40] is good to continue to talk about it and
[00:24:42] I think you know do what you think is
[00:24:44] best if it is something that concern or
[00:24:47] not concerns but that you care about and
[00:24:50] I
[00:24:51] do but anyways we can move on now
[00:24:54] because I don't want to talk about this
[00:24:54] for the whole stream
[00:24:59] only brain robw people are affected by
[00:25:01] it well like that's the thing I don't
[00:25:02] think it's I don't think it's that I
[00:25:03] think if you're like cuz hear me out
[00:25:05] right like if I'm just playing the game
[00:25:07] I'm not going to care but if it if I'm
[00:25:09] like looking into it a bit and I'm like
[00:25:10] hey you're kind of Ying like let's say
[00:25:13] I'm affected by it well I am in some
[00:25:14] ways let's say you're like okay you're
[00:25:15] Ying about you're Ying my culture and
[00:25:17] then whitewashing it you're kind of like
[00:25:19] okay you know maybe maybe this isn't the
[00:25:21] best uh uh way to do it it's not like
[00:25:25] it I don't know I feel like it's not
[00:25:28] that hard like to just do the same thing
[00:25:31] but like not [ __ ] it up but anyways like
[00:25:33] this isn't what I want to spend the
[00:25:34] whole stream on so that's where I stand
[00:25:36] right
[00:25:38] now
[00:25:40] um
[00:25:46] anyways explain your trending
[00:25:49] tab there's a storm in Canada how's that
[00:25:52] wrong
[00:25:58] why are there weird
[00:26:02] Chatters okay but like let let me just
[00:26:04] say one sentence okay like some people
[00:26:07] are like oh culture is not skin color
[00:26:08] sure however if you make a region that's
[00:26:11] like I know it's like a mixture of like
[00:26:13] South America and like Africa and this
[00:26:15] and that but like let's say a part of
[00:26:17] your region is based on Africa and
[00:26:18] everyone's white just like think about
[00:26:20] that for a second like just just think
[00:26:23] like literally I explained this to like
[00:26:25] normal people living in the normal world

[00:32:31] passive I have not seen that in my
[00:32:40] life all right anyways
[00:32:43] um Banner
[00:32:49] review oh I already have this by the way
[00:32:51] this is from like a year ago two years
[00:32:56] ago Banner
[00:33:03] review turn my music down okay Banner
[00:33:07] review uh we got Navia we got Neu both
[00:33:10] of which are pretty good right if you
[00:33:12] want them you know how Neu plays good
[00:33:14] for AOE Navia surprisingly good DPS uh I
[00:33:18] saw some people uh uh respond negatively
[00:33:21] to me being mad that the the like cougar
[00:33:23] Tire girl like this I'm her uh was Gio
[00:33:27] look man I get it any element can be
[00:33:28] good okay I've been saying this since
[00:33:30] 1.0 true okay I'm just saying the
[00:33:32] likeliness of her ending up like dea is
[00:33:34] higher with a GE Vision then without one
[00:33:36] but she can still definitely be good
[00:33:38] Navia is an example of a good Geo
[00:33:39] character okay cool um now with that
[00:33:44] said outside of the five stars four
[00:33:46] stars Kirara great I think Kirara is
[00:33:48] very good um I'm pretty sure Kirara C2
[00:33:51] is good but I don't
[00:33:54] remember oh this is for Co-Op never mind
[00:34:00] uh yeah this is good C6 is pretty
[00:34:03] good and getting more Shield is not bad
[00:34:07] this is oh yeah this is off field yeah
[00:34:08] it's a coordinate attack yeah C4 is nice
[00:34:10] too yeah that's the one yeah yeah she
[00:34:13] has good cons so kirar good character
[00:34:15] plus good cons great ning Wong it is
[00:34:17] what it is uh Cave finally [ __ ] back
[00:34:20] makes sense kind of uh now look we've
[00:34:23] been asking for cave for [ __ ] 2 years
[00:34:25] he's back can I complain no is he good
[00:34:29] also no but it's okay he's he's pretty
[00:34:31] it's okay it's okay um so yeah for those
[00:34:34] of you who want cave he's there uh
[00:34:36] Kirara is a good fourstar we get her for
[00:34:37] free as well though so POG um but her
[00:34:40] cons are
[00:34:41] good so yeah weapon
[00:34:47] Banner is
[00:34:52] honestly I mean look verdict good for
[00:34:56] Navia decent stat stick key in my
[00:35:01] opinion very good and a weapon that I
[00:35:02] underrated okay I think key is like if I
[00:35:06] were to get a five star right now it
[00:35:07] would be key I'm not going to pull on
[00:35:08] this
[00:35:09] Banner uh but if I were to get a five
[00:35:11] star on my account I'd probably choose
[00:35:13] key because it's good for Neu it's a big
[00:35:15] increase it's good for like I could use
[00:35:17] on finina I could use on like kie I you
[00:35:19] could use it it's it's I think it's
[00:35:21] pretty good I think it's very good
[00:35:23] however
[00:35:25] um rust I have perception dragon's Bane
[00:35:29] which has been on every single banner
[00:35:30] the Bell what the [ __ ] is wrong with you
[00:35:33] zos actually good zos is good um it
[00:35:36] gives you em and some energy it's kind
[00:35:38] of like a a fav and an iron sting had a
[00:35:43] baby
[00:35:45] um it's pretty good like I use
[00:35:48] it but I think the rest of the banner is
[00:35:50] kind of eh so like it's okay I don't
[00:35:53] think like realistically you don't need
[00:35:56] the 1.0 four stars so you probably want
[00:35:58] like maybe you want a Five Star Plus zos
[00:36:00] that's it so it might not be like it's
[00:36:03] not like my
[00:36:05] favorite at all how about second phase
[00:36:07] we don't know the banner second phase

[00:55:29] he's my goat level 88 sorry either duuk
[00:55:32] cuz he's my goat or Kirara cuz she's you
[00:55:34] know I love Kirara or Jean but I
[00:55:39] realistically um yeah that's crazy we'll
[00:55:41] get her friend up don't

[00:55:46] was thinking of duuke though wait let me

[00:56:27] okay I don't need to abide by this poll
[00:56:29] though cuz I I I can make my own
[00:56:31] decisions I'm an adult man I can make my

[00:57:10] like all the Chatters are different and
[00:57:12] then I'm going to be like damn I don't

[00:57:33] probably only get two seconds of screen
[00:57:34] time before I press X but it will be
[00:57:40] funny all right uh so Kirara won the
[00:57:43] poll however I'm I think I'm picking the
[00:57:46] Luke anyways cuz uh democracy is rigged

[01:08:05] engaging number one duuke M returns plus
[01:08:08] it's like an easy thumbnail easy easy
[01:08:10] Video duuke Main comeback
[01:08:14] Arc oh I [ __ ] wrote like a reply to
[01:08:18] my tweet and I forgot to press
[01:08:20] send I mean I guess it's too late okay
[01:08:23] whatever
[01:08:27] _ traveler donated three what's up time
[01:08:30] traveler hello Mrs socks how should I
[01:08:33] build
[01:08:34] the I like her design but her gameplay
[01:08:37] seems a bit midth thinking no well okay
[01:08:39] yeah a lot of people are complaining
[01:08:40] about the Shah archons um gameplay but
[01:08:43] like the tarita but the thing is uh I I
[01:08:45] actually think she's pretty fun if you
[01:08:47] know what you're doing like yeah you
[01:08:48] don't spend that much time on her in her
[01:08:49] optimal rotation but you like if you
[01:08:52] weave in a basic attack EQ like you do
[01:08:54] get a lot of value your whole team can
[01:08:55] run Vermillion if you have her in your
[01:08:57] team also what's really nice is you can
[01:08:59] run the new artifact set released in uh
[01:09:00] 6.0 that's her best in slot but you can
[01:09:03] also do like a supportive set you might
[01:09:04] want like a milth you might want just
[01:09:06] any generic set you might have no blast
[01:09:08] works but I don't recommend it a
[01:09:10] blizzard stayer in a freeze team is
[01:09:11] pretty good obviously blizz sh is kind
[01:09:13] of too good M CH though can help with
[01:09:15] consistency if you have finina you might
[01:09:17] be like Z are you [ __ ] dumb uh
[01:09:19] blizzard ster gives 40 crit rate wait
[01:09:21] what am I talking about calm down yeah
[01:09:23] 40 crit rate dude I haven't played genin
[01:09:25] since long it's 40 right 40 crit rate
[01:09:27] plus 15 Crow damage bonus right okay why
[01:09:29] would you go Mar that only gives 36 okay
[01:09:31] are you [ __ ] stupid well listen Okay
[01:09:34] 36 isn't 40 and you get normal attack
[01:09:37] and charge attack damage instead of crow
[01:09:38] damage bonus so obviously it's worse
[01:09:40] right sure sure sure but uh against
[01:09:43] enemies that can't be frozen right a
[01:09:44] mono Crow team for instance would only
[01:09:46] get 20 crit rate mag say it gives you
[01:09:48] always the 36 so it is uh good as well
[01:09:51] right it's not as good but it helps with
[01:09:53] consistency however um I I personally do
[01:09:57] like the sard I think her play style is
[01:09:58] pretty fun and I think there's a lot of
[01:09:59] different ways you can build her uh so
[01:10:01] do with that what you will I hope that
[01:10:02] helped thanks for $3 time traveler
[01:10:04] anyways uh
[01:10:05] duuke duuke animations let's try it we
[01:10:08] have a level 90 we have in Friendship
[01:10:10] eight
[01:10:11] unlock Kirara will be next by the way so
[01:10:14] don't get mad at me I love Kirara I
[01:10:16] think the order is duuke Kirara then one
[01:10:19] of the three maybe ning Wong but I don't
[01:10:20] have a yeah we'll see probably Jee then
[01:10:23] all right

[01:10:45] sand okay no spoilers chat don't tell me
[01:10:47] what it is don't tell me what it looks
[01:10:48] like don't tell me what to do the only
[01:10:50] thing I'm going to do though is I'm
[01:10:52] going to remove red horn because this
[01:10:53] weapon's particularly good with Bennett
[01:10:56] uh Bennett gives you a lot of attack so
[01:10:58] it makes up for the low base attack
[01:10:59] still a good weapon overall but we're
[01:11:01] going to go a big OAB boonga wolves
[01:11:05] gravestone um his his weapon right it's
[01:11:09] his weapon he it was made with him in
[01:11:14] mind uh I'm also going to remove my em
[01:11:16] goblet because if we're soloing we
[01:11:18] probably don't need em so I'm running an
[01:11:19] em pyro goblet we're going to filter

[01:18:37] me IGN genin impact beginner's
[01:18:45] guide on the surface ginin impact seems
[01:18:49] like a Zelda breath of the wild clone
[01:18:51] but after a few weeks with the game it's
[01:18:53] dude [ __ ] you
[01:18:55] itself to be something quite unique

[01:20:03] does work while you Glide he's like
[01:20:04] [ __ ] out
[01:20:09] fire nice yeah I hope more characters
[01:20:12] get them too it's again I've been saying
[01:20:14] this since day one adding things that
[01:20:16] are cosmetic like difficulty locked or
[01:20:19] challenges stuff like that that's just
[01:20:21] cosmetic is really good for people that
[01:20:22] play the game just like for for fun or a
[01:20:25] long time cuz like if everything's Primo
[01:20:27] gem lock then we can't like if
[01:20:29] everything's just okay Primos are great
[01:20:30] obviously but if everything's behind if
[01:20:32] everything is for Primo gems then it
[01:20:34] can't be that hard or free to play or
[01:20:36] like newer players will complain right
[01:20:38] it's I'm not nothing as freet play
[01:20:40] players be free to play that's great you
[01:20:41] know save your money spend it otherwise
[01:20:43] but I'm just saying if like if like if
[01:20:45] everything is preo unlocked if
[01:20:47] everything is like okay let's say they
[01:20:48] release a game mode right a raid you
[01:20:50] have to fight the [ __ ] the the
[01:20:51] [ __ ] a pyramid you have to go through
[01:20:53] it top of the pyramid big [ __ ] boss
[01:20:55] whips his [ __ ] out you do it with eight
[01:20:56] of your friends okay there should be
[01:20:58] like difficulty levels and then the
[01:21:00] highest difficulty gives you or like not
[01:21:01] the highest but like whatever like a a
[01:21:03] hard difficulty you get like Max Primo
[01:21:05] gems awesome but then there should be a
[01:21:06] difficulty past that where you're doing
[01:21:08] it just for like something like a
[01:21:10] [ __ ] I don't know a weapon or like a
[01:21:12] [ __ ] name card a pet a [ __ ] little
[01:21:14] like a [ __ ] a dude that follows you
[01:21:16] around he's like I am the [ __ ]
[01:21:19] mummy I don't know or like animations

[01:23:32] ears wait she's kind of
[01:23:34] cool she's a Healer or
[01:23:39] abundance fire abundance so probably a
[01:23:42] [ __ ] you know healer
[01:23:56] huh wait yeah her feet are red wait why'
[01:23:58] you guys notice that so fast why'd you
[01:24:01] notice the feet before the hands why'
[01:24:03] you notice the feet before the hands
[01:24:05] also why am I getting Sparkle Vibes is
[01:24:07] this wrong oh yeah I feel on chat of
[01:24:08] saying it too I feel like her face looks
[01:24:10] or eyes I don't know something about her
[01:24:12] is giving Sparkle Vibes what is
[01:24:14] it the hair bangs
[01:24:32] anyways
[01:24:34] yeah what is it is that like pedals in a
[01:24:37] pestal and
[01:24:43] mortar I'm gonna be honest uh I don't
[01:24:47] okay I know you could probably say this
[01:24:48] about a lot of characters but she looks
[01:24:49] like a lot of other characters in Star
[01:24:51] Fusion together so every time I look at
[01:24:53] her I see a charact
[01:24:54] like I either see tingyun or I see
[01:24:56] Sparkle or I see like Ron
[01:24:59] may like it's actually like [ __ ] with
[01:25:02] me
[01:25:12] like
[01:25:22] anyways classic Sandro design
[01:25:26] I feel like I don't I actually don't
[01:25:27] know every character from there so I
[01:25:28] can't speak but I saw okay I saw like
[01:25:32] screenshots from
[01:25:33] this no wait that's the wait live in two
[01:25:37] days okay I guess we're streaming Friday
[01:25:39] if you guys want to watch my reaction to
[01:25:41] the 2.4 uh we We'll Be
[01:25:45] Live um but anyways
[01:25:49] uh oh it's this yeah I I saw pictures on
[01:25:53] my TL I didn't like watch it that was
[01:25:56] like I'll wait till
[01:25:58] stream I saw there was like some girl
[01:26:00] taking a bath and like some dude but
[01:26:03] yeah let's just watch it marad Celestia
[01:26:06] trailer stoneharts oath
[01:26:09] ring donated $1 wait Mr socks is it $100
[01:26:14] or 100 Subs okay well 100 Subs is like
[01:26:17] five times more than $100 so I could
[01:26:18] scam you and say 100 Subs however no I
[01:26:20] was saying dollars cuz also it's like um
[01:26:26] twitch Subs are like there okay I feel
[01:26:29] like twitch Subs were implemented by
[01:26:30] twitch to make you not donate because
[01:26:33] now instead of people used to donate all
[01:26:35] the time now people give Subs which is
[01:26:36] fine I appreciate it but it's like when
[01:26:38] you give Subs twitch gets like either
[01:26:40] half or 30% depending on like your
[01:26:41] partner tier but uh uh donos you get
[01:26:44] like all of it except I think PayPal
[01:26:45] takes like a little bit but not nearly
[01:26:47] yeah anyways uh okay let's watch
[01:26:52] this D this debt collection period
[01:26:55] penacon has been reincorporated into the
[01:26:58] ipc's distribution of shares but we also
[01:27:01] paid a high
[01:27:03] price ACC wait what does okay I know
[01:27:05] what the IPC is they're like capitalist
[01:27:08] like IRS but what does it actually stand
[01:27:11] for internal piss
[01:27:20] commission inter inter Interstellar
[01:27:23] piece
[01:27:24] Corp all right
[01:27:28] inasal he also paid a high
[01:27:31] price a Cornerstone was completely
[01:27:34] destroyed yep we saw that thus Diamond
[01:27:37] summoned everyone okay also I haven't
[01:27:39] seen other characters and I I'm just
[01:27:41] going to say this I've had some time to
[01:27:44] reflect like while just doing other
[01:27:46] stuff aventurine might
[01:27:49] be like one of my favorite characters of
[01:27:51] all time well okay not of all time but
[01:27:53] like gen and star rail combined
[01:27:55] aventurine like up
[01:27:58] there with me as chair to decide
[01:28:01] aventurine
[01:28:04] punishment take away his position as one
[01:28:06] of the 10 stone
[01:28:09] hearts we all took an oath to treasure
[01:28:11] the cornerstones like our own
[01:28:14] lives he also says b death was a
[01:28:17] necessary part of the
[01:28:20] plan death this kind of unnecessary
[01:28:23] extrav a was just
[01:28:26] for kind of
[01:28:28] unnecessary hello who the [ __ ] is this
[01:28:32] this kind of unnecessary I like this guy
[01:28:35] Avance
[01:28:36] was just for yourself wasn't it soite
[01:28:41] please don't ignore the facts and just
[01:28:42] assume wait I like this guy part of the
[01:28:46] plan death this kind of unnecessary
[01:28:50] extravagance
[01:28:54] extravagance was just for yourself Lord
[01:28:57] I know they're all like gems there like
[01:28:58] diamond and then
[01:29:01] [Music]
[01:29:03] Suite why isn't this a playable outfit
[01:29:06] by reclaiming penone the Strategic
[01:29:08] investment Department won over another
[01:29:10] vote of the seven board members
[01:29:12] Jade the 10 ston Hearts have always
[01:29:15] valued

[01:29:22] Sapphire is in favor of punishment is
[01:29:25] that a [ __ ] bird there's also aot
[01:29:28] they might be dead I even have to convey
[01:29:31] their opinions for [ __ ] is aot just my
[01:29:33] two cents who are you we being overly
[01:29:45] yinin just my two sons I think we'll be
[01:29:49] overly timid did imagine if it were me
[01:29:52] I'd like imagine skipping y more blood
[01:30:01] bath Amber prefers to remain neutral
[01:30:05] this is her
[01:30:06] vote but as an
[01:30:08] intellion blood I'd let everything
[01:30:11] become more of a blood
[01:30:18] bath okay uh to remain neutral I know
[01:30:22] which characters I'm skipping and on I'm
[01:30:24] I'm not skipping but as an intelligent
[01:30:27] Firefly I sorry think there should be
[01:30:30] more Justice in your life
[01:30:33] kokomi this is her
[01:30:36] vote but as an intellig N ki's think
[01:30:40] there should be more J clear
[01:30:44] sorry one vote left as expected the
[01:30:48] final verdict comes down to this
[01:30:51] one I kind of like that guy the natur
[01:30:54] what the [ __ ] is this oh my God it's

[01:45:31] out settle
[01:45:34] down oh I have Prince I didn't show you

[01:45:56] starting from the next Abyss since
[01:45:58] everything aligned to new schedule wait
[01:46:00] really that's pretty good A new Abyss
[01:46:02] every month surely they don't power [ __ ]
[01:46:04] the abyss every month power CRI the
[01:46:05] abyss every month and instead add 413 14
[01:46:08] and 15 oh Z what are 13 14 and 15 going
[01:46:11] to be okay hear me out so they changed
[01:46:13] floor 12 to one of the older ones where
[01:46:15] it's a bit easier right 13 and 14 are
[01:46:17] kind of like the newer uh 12 that are
[01:46:19] harder right okay floor 15 they add a
[01:46:21] level 120 ene
[01:46:23] then for 16 they add it's a 30 okay hear
[01:46:28] me out CH it's two Chambers only each
[01:46:30] chamber three teams chamber one a bunch
[01:46:33] of enemies multiple waves Nikita useless
[01:46:35] okay okay that's fine chamber
[01:46:38] two sorry uh uh yeah chamber two you
[01:46:42] enter you have 45 second limit first you
[01:46:45] fight one level 120 PMA okay but with no
[01:46:49] cut scene so you can actually speedrun
[01:46:50] it then you're going to have about 15
[01:46:52] seconds left first a quick rhythm game
[01:46:54] you have to do then five letters appear
[01:46:56] you have to type them on your keyboard
[01:46:58] then with the last 10 seconds you have
[01:47:00] to enter your credit card information
[01:47:01] and the three wacky numbers on the back
[01:47:03] if you type it in time you clear but it
[01:47:05] cost you
[01:47:08] $20
[01:47:18] busted here comes the
[01:47:21] catch this is

[01:47:25] good cause though what if it's for like
[01:47:27] a charity then

[02:38:16] later level on Talent is hard to watch I

[02:38:27] you like Hydro app and a bit of
[02:38:30] damage it's not bad to Neo q

[02:57:25] star that is crazy all right you can't
[02:57:28] even find your team you're running arino
[02:57:31] arino Ryden uh I guess that's an off
[02:57:34] field Ryden and a Chevy team I mean
[02:57:36] that's okay I guess you could probably
[02:57:38] just play like fishell
[02:57:40] but I mean fal's in your second half why
[02:57:42] don't you play kazwa what dude what are
[02:57:45] you doing
[02:57:49] are you did you include
[02:57:51] gearing wait your writing's on crit what
[02:57:54] the [ __ ] are
[02:57:55] you also you have no
[02:58:01] sound wait why is your rting on crit if
[02:58:04] you're playing AR
[02:58:09] Lino brother this is

[02:58:16] about the car just click
[02:58:19] sorry I mean I guess it's okay it's fair
[02:58:21] your second team skills on HP I get it
[02:58:23] but like 20% damage that's pretty POG no
[02:58:26] I don't
[02:58:27] know but I mean you you already Skiller
[02:58:34] shoed
[02:58:37] um I mean this this so far this is fine
[02:58:41] okay I mean you just got knocked back
[02:58:43] twice I don't know what you're doing
[02:58:45] it's okay your quality looks [ __ ] but
[02:58:46] it's fine I mean I'm not going to
[02:58:47] disrespect you your aro's damage is
[02:58:53] good now okay you didn't yeah I mean you
[02:58:56] can kill the three at the same time what
[02:58:57] the
[02:59:02] [ __ ] bro what are you just reset
[02:59:06] [Music]
[02:59:08] just okay let me teach you something let
[02:59:10] me you something okay I I didn't think
[02:59:12] we're going to do okay [ __ ] you for this
[02:59:14] I didn't think we're going to do this
[02:59:15] today but let's do this today okay in
[02:59:18] the current spiral
[02:59:21] Abyss in the current spiral Abyss the
[02:59:24] first wave of enemies there's three
[02:59:25] little triangle
[02:59:29] things right there's three of
[02:59:33] these okay what you want to do is you
[02:59:36] want to hit all three at once okay
[02:59:37] typically if I spawn here I'll run to
[02:59:39] one of the sides and then try to push
[02:59:40] them into each other so that I can kill
[02:59:42] all three at once okay there's other
[02:59:43] ways to do it but the point is you kill
[02:59:45] all three if you have big AOE you can
[02:59:47] even stand here whatever you kill or you
[02:59:49] could k e you kill all three before they
[02:59:52] go invisible now not only did you not
[02:59:54] kill them at the same time you had one
[02:59:56] [ __ ] literally wandering about
[02:59:58] bro look at this guy he's he's
[03:00:02] gone it's fine you didn't lose that much
[03:00:04] time but
[03:00:08] anyways uh I will say something let's
[03:00:12] okay you know what let's do this today
[03:00:13] you want to play you want to play Let's
[03:00:15] Play WA actually let me keep watching
[03:00:17] before we do
[03:00:22] this Ultra ey frames there was actually
[03:00:24] pretty good
[03:00:27] um I think your arino is good I just
[03:00:29] don't understand why Ryan's in this team
[03:00:31] arino so let's run this let's run the
[03:00:33] numbers arino doesn't need energy Chevy
[03:00:35] doesn't need energy Ki doesn't need
[03:00:37] energy so what is Ryden like
[03:00:40] accomplishing other than damage
[03:00:48] also wait a
[03:00:54] second oh no you already have Bond of
[03:00:56] life okay never
[03:01:00] mind like I feel like so if you're
[03:01:02] playing like overload off field Ryden
[03:01:05] cuz you want to you can put it on full
[03:01:06] em sure but like you're playing like a
[03:01:09] dual DPS here I don't I don't get the
[03:01:12] but you're barely even swapping into
[03:01:13] Ryden so it's as though you didn't have
[03:01:14] another character slot I don't get why
[03:01:16] you don't just play fishal or bet or
[03:01:18] like Bennett or something like like
[03:01:20] something else I don't see the point of
[03:01:25] um of Ryden here like you're not
[03:01:27] swapping to Ryden at all also your Abyss
[03:01:30] like the bid rate is kind of cooked but
[03:01:31] it's
[03:01:33] fine like again you're not swapping into
[03:01:39] Ryden all right it's probably it's
[03:01:41] probably a [ __ ]
[03:01:46] post what is your right in build
[03:01:50] catch okay
[03:01:53] emblem that's
[03:01:56] good that's good hey king that's
[03:02:03] good yo wait that's me okay why is Ryan
[03:02:06] in this team
[03:02:25] that's what I
[03:02:29] thought okay let's actually let's
[03:02:31] actually start
[03:02:33] okay uh let me TV to the abyss really
[03:02:38] fast you meant to say y instead official
[03:02:40] no but y would also be better
[03:02:44] there Electro okay a man of few words I
[03:02:48] see catboy toast listen to me and listen
[03:02:51] carefully okay I love Ryden as much as
[03:02:53] the next guy but if you purely need an
[03:02:55] offield electro for your arino team I
[03:02:59] highly recommend another Electro
[03:03:01] character an off field one like fishal B
[03:03:03] ya Miko I would not recommend uh a full
[03:03:07] crit ryen that you barely burst
[03:03:12] on okay
[03:03:16] anyways um
[03:03:22] listen up today what we're
[03:03:25] doing very straightforward you probably
[03:03:27] know if you don't then I will explain it
[03:03:30] to you we're going to be uh uh uh I
[03:03:32] asked you guys I asked I said submit
[03:03:36] your best or worst Abyss Clips we're
[03:03:38] going to react to them we're going to
[03:03:39] make fun of them and we're going to
[03:03:40] educate people it's going to be a mix of
[03:03:42] help
[03:03:44] and what's the other word get paid bad
[03:03:47] at this
[03:03:48] game I'm not bad what are you talking
[03:03:51] about me bad at
[03:03:54] genin yeah so we're going to uh laugh at
[03:03:57] your fails but also try to help okay
[03:03:58] it's going to be a bit of both by
[03:04:00] submitting in the Discord you consented
[03:04:02] to getting purely made fun of uh so now
[03:04:05] it's beyond your control
[03:04:08] also uh last video was mostly hyper like
[03:04:11] I realized by accident it was like all
[03:04:13] hyper bom clears this one will be
[03:04:15] diverse also also I don't know when this
[03:04:17] is getting uploaded but this uh Abyss is
[03:04:20] very annoying this one of the most
[03:04:22] annoying abysses of all time uh so
[03:04:24] there's some unique team building tips
[03:04:26] that apply just to this Abyss now most
[03:04:28] of this will just be general information
[03:04:29] or general
[03:04:31] haha this is too long of an intro you
[03:04:33] can cut all of this but anyways uh
[03:04:35] however note there's some Weir like
[03:04:37] fatherless Flames this [ __ ]
[03:04:39] sucks balls you need like a ton of hydro
[03:04:41] for him so you're going to need a bit of
[03:04:44] a unique team for this Abyss but anyways
[03:04:49] all right Scuff the biz
[03:04:52] clears basically I said send me your
[03:04:54] worst clips and then people send me them
[03:04:56] so some will be terrible and we laugh
[03:04:59] some might need advice we give advice I
[03:05:01] don't know we'll see okay also this ays
[03:05:03] kind of sucks uh you need a bunch of
[03:05:05] hydro and it's annoying there you go
[03:05:08] condensed all right back to being
[03:05:11] normal sorry okay anyways
[03:05:16] um okay we ready did catboy
[03:05:19] toast uh let me scroll back let's see
[03:05:22] what clears we can get let me keep
[03:05:24] scrolling was that this is [ __ ] Zio
[03:05:29] archives I'm free to play
[03:05:33] whale bro you're the guy that's
[03:05:35] uploading all my vods what the I just
[03:05:37] saw a banana did anyone else see that
[03:05:39] banana what the [ __ ] was
[03:05:41] that wait why did I just see a banana
[03:05:52] um bro Jesus what are these sound
[03:05:57] effects honestly I respect I kind of
[03:05:59] respect this so I I mean normally I
[03:06:02] would run like a Bennett arino team but
[03:06:04] you're running double Hydro cuz this
[03:06:06] Abyss has a lot of pyro so I actually
[03:06:08] think you know respectable Mr archives
[03:06:09] first team you have a y quick and team
[03:06:12] uh I like it but dendro traveler is
[03:06:14] probably the worst thing you could okay
[03:06:16] you don't need double here cuz what does
[03:06:18] an extra D do you're going to you're
[03:06:20] going to spread o I'm going to spread on
[03:06:22] my traveler no you're not what the [ __ ]
[03:06:24] is traveler going to do y fishal Nita
[03:06:27] actually pretty good your last thought
[03:06:28] should be like a Kaza maybe a sucros
[03:06:30] maybe a jang Lee maybe something else I
[03:06:32] wouldn't go a d Traver
[03:06:35] there uh you don't have a Healer either
[03:06:39] um yeah Dey does not help you don't need
[03:06:42] a lot of um dendro in an aggravate team
[03:06:50] okay let me look at your chamber one oh
[03:06:52] my God these okay look I know you're
[03:06:55] probably on like a a old phone or
[03:06:56] something that's fine I'm not making fun
[03:06:58] of you not everyone has the best
[03:07:00] technology however this is look like are
[03:07:03] you seeing what I'm seeing like I'm
[03:07:05] sorry what is happening what am I
[03:07:07] looking at I'm always watching right
[03:07:10] here I mean the game play is pretty good
[03:07:12] I
[03:07:13] think again what is D MC doing you
[03:07:16] literally did a e which did nothing
[03:07:18] except remove Electro no okay there
[03:07:21] wasn't even Electro there I mean I guess
[03:07:22] did was that 41k from him or from
[03:07:25] Nita right here right now anyways you
[03:07:28] did an
[03:07:29] e yeah and then you did two physical
[03:07:32] Basics my Royal
[03:07:35] Decree
[03:07:40] emerge
[03:07:42] propagate right now right here midnight
[03:07:46] fantastic
[03:07:49] the Temple of wiard nothing lasts
[03:07:52] forever right now right here emerge I
[03:07:56] mean it's good it's it's actually pretty
[03:07:58] good like you know what you're doing and
[03:07:59] dead jop is not a bad character like
[03:08:01] you're doing fine I just think there's a
[03:08:02] better last slot but like you're doing
[03:08:04] fine I respect it I think you you 36 St
[03:08:06] clear though that's no

[03:11:33] mean what's your other
[03:11:36] team you didn't even show your teams no
[03:11:39] forina okay yeah we're we're not
[03:11:40] watching yeah nice try buddy net finina
[03:11:43] K ji that is the most meta thing I've
[03:11:45] ever seen sunny
[03:11:48] [Music]
[03:11:50] uh here's some advice for optimizing my
[03:11:52] rotations you know what
[03:11:56] sure you watermarked your
[03:12:02] [ __ ] brother
[03:12:06] everybody Le Adorn my night witness the
[03:12:10] power
[03:12:11] of what's your second half okay can we
[03:12:15] see one team that's not net finina I
[03:12:20] beg that guy said I love
[03:12:23] French this guy misspelled
[03:12:25] floor2 LeBron
[03:12:29] James I almost don't want to watch
[03:12:35] this 411 part two
[03:12:47] okay what's with your saturation right
[03:12:48] now why does it look like I'm having a
[03:12:59] stroke okay uh wait is that
[03:13:05] ah are you going to finina burst are you
[03:13:07] going to finina burst are you going to
[03:13:10] finina burst are you going to finina
[03:13:12] burst are you going to finina burst are
[03:13:15] you going to finina burst
[03:13:17] first can you press Q on for
[03:13:23] it
[03:13:28] um
[03:13:44] um there is like so much wrong I don't
[03:13:47] know where to begin okay Le let's do a
[03:13:50] let's talk about a few things first of
[03:13:51] all regarding team selection number one
[03:13:54] um finina without a Healer is fine
[03:13:56] because of chlorin right chlorine can
[03:13:57] sell heal however your chlorine is level
[03:13:59] 70 and your ficial is level 80 this
[03:14:01] means that you're [ __ ] aggravate
[03:14:03] damage and Hyper blo you're [ __ ]
[03:14:04] hyper blooming too you are doing like a
[03:14:07] big chunk less damage like probably 20
[03:14:10] 30ish per I don't know the exact number
[03:14:12] you're doing a lot less
[03:14:13] damage um
[03:14:18] also you have Nita on your account right
[03:14:22] there second team is
[03:14:26] good first team is fine I would do
[03:14:30] personally I like aggravate more than
[03:14:31] quick Bloom for um Claren first of all
[03:14:35] level her to 90 second of all I would
[03:14:38] rather do like Claren official Nita and
[03:14:41] then either the Jang Le from that team
[03:14:43] or an Animo character like a sucros if
[03:14:46] you don't have Kazo or kazuwa if you
[03:14:48] want to play finina though that's
[03:14:50] fine uh I would put BYU there instead of
[03:14:53] Kirara or Nita you have Nita and BYU I
[03:14:55] would I would choose one of them but
[03:14:56] it's fine level 90 her for sure
[03:15:00] though also here like okay first of all
[03:15:03] you should finina burst second of all uh
[03:15:06] I feel like Kirara is not enough dendro
[03:15:09] app Kirara is enough d drop for
[03:15:14] aggravate finina versus a DPS loss okay
[03:15:17] why are you playing finina if you're if
[03:15:18] you're in a team where finina bursts
[03:15:20] okay first of all it's not a DPS loss
[03:15:22] but if it is why would you play her just
[03:15:24] [ __ ] swap out of her it's 75% damage
[03:15:27] bonus well up to 75 it's
[03:15:31] scaling the only times it's like you
[03:15:34] don't care is like Neu Bloom but even
[03:15:37] for Bloom you care because it Buffs her
[03:15:39] damage and you're probably running a
[03:15:40] character like yolan or like someone
[03:15:43] that does damage okay that's bait
[03:15:45] anyways um
[03:15:49] wait what card did you just pick HP what
[03:15:51] was your team Hut I guess that makes
[03:15:53] sense what was the other card damage
[03:15:54] within sprinting wait why did you take
[03:15:56] damage within
[03:15:58] sprinting anyways
[03:16:01] um I feel like this is not enough so
[03:16:04] Kira is enough dendra out for Quicken
[03:16:05] but you're [ __ ] removing the the
[03:16:07] dendro with
[03:16:09] Hydro so like wait let me actually look
[03:16:12] how much how many okay you got so kirar
[03:16:14] burst
[03:16:15] cool
[03:16:20] cool this guy is no longer dendro oh no
[03:16:23] he's dendro
[03:16:28] now that guy's not you're electroch
[03:16:30] charging this guy now he's not
[03:16:33] dead now you have to do a whole other
[03:16:39] rotation
[03:16:41] yeah he let's look at the second oh you
[03:16:44] pressed e
[03:16:48] you should have just waited for the next
[03:16:49] rotation there's no reason to press e
[03:16:51] there cuz now you're on a six-year cool
[03:16:52] down I don't know if you're on
[03:16:53] thundering Fury but it's fine you do the
[03:16:56] long rotation here finina e q
[03:17:01] yep yeah C4 Kirara helps I don't know if
[03:17:04] you have C4
[03:17:06] Kirara 1 two three
[03:17:11] boom that doesn't look like
[03:17:13] TF you didn't apply oh you apply D okay
[03:17:15] burst apply dendro q q q q q q q
[03:17:19] [Music]
[03:17:23] q try to line up your shots if you can
[03:17:26] like you can reposition with your dash
[03:17:27] if you need to Claren shots Pierce
[03:17:30] enemies try to line them up for is bad
[03:17:33] the whole team is 50% HP yes like the
[03:17:35] other team like finina teams usually run
[03:17:37] a Healer but Clarin selfhealing and like
[03:17:39] manipulation of things is is usually
[03:17:41] fine like finina still works with her
[03:17:52] yeah okay this is mostly like a skill
[03:17:58] issue okay
[03:18:01] um I mean Hut
[03:18:09] team what are you
[03:18:13] attacking okay this is fine this fine
[03:18:15] you break the shield and you Hut e I
[03:18:17] mean I guess you could save Hut you
[03:18:18] could just attack on yolan I mean I I
[03:18:20] don't know what you're saving it for
[03:18:21] [ __ ] gen impact 2 you're doing
[03:18:23] another rotation it's fine it's fine you
[03:18:25] set up you set up for Hut now you go Hut
[03:18:28] E Auto Dash yep yep try to group I mean
[03:18:30] try to push them into each other at
[03:18:31] least when they explode we'll see if you
[03:18:33] do it okay your cancels are it's
[03:18:37] [Music]
[03:18:42] fine can we get a can we get a slow
[03:18:44] motion on that instant replay
[03:18:47] you just Hut bursted when this guy was
[03:18:50] invulnerable and the other guy was out
[03:18:52] of range someone said bro aled my
[03:19:06] dad uh it's honestly fine I think you
[03:19:09] have a decent understanding
[03:19:11] of wait let me watch let me watch I I
[03:19:13] want to speak to you soon you have a
[03:19:16] basic understand set of what to do I
[03:19:18] think you could just execute it a lot
[03:19:19] better so for example let's talk about
[03:19:21] these lectors
[03:19:23] okay here like let's say you have your
[03:19:25] abilities ready you could have like
[03:19:26] managed your cool Downs whatever you
[03:19:28] would do like you would set up right you
[03:19:30] do like EQ on all your characters except
[03:19:32] strongly you just e okay you hold e
[03:19:34] burst e syro and what you would want to
[03:19:37] do is like with syro you try to like
[03:19:39] stagger this enemy into this enemy so
[03:19:41] you do like EQ and then he'll he'll get
[03:19:43] pushed towards the other one then
[03:19:44] eventually they get closer together and
[03:19:46] then you them into each other and then
[03:19:47] they're grouped and if they're kind of
[03:19:49] grouped Hut whose AOE isn't known to be
[03:19:52] the best you can Dash through them so
[03:19:55] like let's say you like I on Hut here if
[03:19:58] they're like a bit more group to each
[03:20:00] other Hut's Dash you don't actually have
[03:20:02] to cancel the charge attack you can
[03:20:03] charge attack between both of them and
[03:20:05] it's actually pretty good but now you're
[03:20:07] like single targeting
[03:20:10] both
[03:20:13] anyways um
[03:20:17] let me look at your
[03:20:27] builds
[03:20:29] hello right let me look at your your
[03:20:32] builds this
[03:20:34] loading okay I don't know what's
[03:20:36] happening with your saturation okay your
[03:20:37] kirar does have constellation so she
[03:20:38] applies a bit more dandro with C4 fluff
[03:20:41] sound Fairman that's fine golden troop
[03:20:42] that's good that's
[03:20:45] fine you can level your skill but it's
[03:20:48] okay harp troop C3 official unfortunate
[03:20:53] it's okay uh your burst is level two but
[03:20:56] I mean I respect it clarent yeah that's
[03:21:00] a really good ratio the fact that you
[03:21:01] can't 36 star bro why isn't she why is
[03:21:05] she level
[03:21:07] 70 Ascend her
[03:21:16] five okay I'm done dude level your
[03:21:19] talents please level talents before
[03:21:21] artifacts please level your
[03:21:24] talents
[03:21:31] Ernesto from January
[03:21:35] what why did you post an old
[03:21:41] clip what the [ __ ] is this
[03:21:47] [Music]
[03:21:49] is this YULA hyper
[03:21:53] Bloom I'm done
[03:22:00] next rendering this almost made my PC
[03:22:03] explode all right bet that's what I like
[03:22:05] to hear that's how you know it's going
[03:22:07] to be a banger oh yeah all right this is
[03:22:11] a
[03:22:12] banger wait why is the screen what what
[03:22:14] is h wait why is there like like a what
[03:22:18] resolution do you play
[03:22:20] on
[03:22:25] um okay I respect the rotation however
[03:22:28] keep in mind that FAL and bet snapshot
[03:22:30] so you could use like your Chevy Buffs
[03:22:31] before them um obviously you want to
[03:22:34] apply Electro to overload but before
[03:22:35] like your bet burst or something that's
[03:22:36] okay uh let's watch appli Electro arino
[03:22:40] e again not grouping these guys you
[03:22:42] probably should but it's okay um
[03:22:45] although BET's not bouncing with between
[03:22:46] any of
[03:22:50] them wait did you just tap e on
[03:22:56] Chevy wait you have to hold it to get
[03:23:00] the the
[03:23:06] buff okay it's fine I mean whatever okay
[03:23:09] could have grouped them better it's fine
[03:23:10] let's look at the next
[03:23:11] part okay let's look at the next part
[03:23:13] you could official Q here to just kill
[03:23:14] it and then you move with your official
[03:23:16] Q to the next wave of enemies while the
[03:23:17] ruin grater guard okay that's fine
[03:23:20] that's
[03:23:22] fine I mean did you wait Can you Chevy e
[03:23:24] please wait did you not e what's what
[03:23:26] did I miss something wait you eat
[03:23:27] earlier where did he e did I skip it
[03:23:31] where's
[03:23:32] the I skipped
[03:23:34] it please tell me you held
[03:23:44] it okay for a lot of characters you
[03:23:47] could just tap e and you don't need to
[03:23:48] hold when it's like an aim okay so I
[03:23:50] understand if you didn't read their kit
[03:23:52] maybe you didn't watch my guide yeah
[03:23:53] look I made a guide you can watch it but
[03:23:55] Chevy and look granted I haven't read
[03:23:57] her kid in a
[03:23:58] while but let me show you
[03:24:01] something Chev grants coordinated
[03:24:04] tactics to nearby party members after a
[03:24:05] character triggers the overloaded
[03:24:06] reaction oh wait no that's not the right
[03:24:08] one what the [ __ ] oh this one wait what
[03:24:10] the [ __ ] where is oh yeah no it is this
[03:24:12] no it isn't
[03:24:13] this wait again I have to read the kit
[03:24:16] it's this one it's this one uh so you
[03:24:19] get this no matter what this one uh
[03:24:21] increase attack up to
[03:24:23] 40% when you fire an overcharged ball
[03:24:25] what's an overcharged ball you get that
[03:24:27] when you overload and then what hold
[03:24:29] enter aiming mode if Chev has an
[03:24:30] overcharged ball she will fire an
[03:24:32] overcharge
[03:24:33] ball there you
[03:24:36] go you self-reported true I didn't know
[03:24:38] which part of the kid it was there this
[03:24:40] one
[03:24:42] A4 this one doesn't matter this one you
[03:24:44] just [ __ ] do the thing but
[03:24:49] to it is okay to be fair it is weird
[03:24:52] that if you just tap it you don't fire
[03:24:53] the overcharge ball I will give that to
[03:24:55] you but yeah you have to hold it to fire
[03:24:58] it all
[03:25:02] anyways that's fine good e that's okay
[03:25:05] you could have saved B burst for a bit
[03:25:07] later just because there's two enemies I
[03:25:09] mean it's fine you have good off time on
[03:25:10] it it's fine it's
[03:25:13] fine oh my God you even wait run that
[03:25:18] back did the
[03:25:21] mark

[03:25:37] arlino Mark didn't even cook you got
[03:25:41] like wait did it wait wait wait let me
[03:25:43] see
[03:25:51] no you
[03:25:59] didn't I mean
[03:26:03] wait cuz you got enough BL but it didn't
[03:26:05] look like it
[03:26:06] cooked do you have Scythe Scythe gives
[03:26:09] Bond of life I don't know if you have
[03:26:11] it oh maybe he did get it actually frame
[03:26:14] perfect maybe it was
[03:26:16] okay never mind
[03:26:20] wait okay you might be better at the
[03:26:22] game you you might be better at the game
[03:26:24] than I am wait do you have Scythe if you
[03:26:26] don't then you got
[03:26:28] it cuz it would be bigger if you had
[03:26:30] Scythe I think no wait what it
[03:26:33] not wait how much was it wait am
[03:26:38] I whatever I I think you got
[03:26:43] it this is fine actually wait is it it
[03:26:46] what did you
[03:26:48] do e yep swap yep Chevy hold e Chevy
[03:26:52] swap the Chevy Chevy hold oh my God you
[03:26:54] tapped
[03:26:55] again okay it's fine that's
[03:27:00] fine your grouping is not bad but this
[03:27:02] guy's walking
[03:27:14] backwards it's honestly whatever I mean
[03:27:16] you just need to hold the on Chevy
[03:27:17] that's all the rest is okay like it's
[03:27:26] fine skip frame by
[03:27:29] frame okay let me
[03:27:41] see let me go back I can spam Dot
[03:27:48] well actually I mean I could just
[03:27:52] wait okay I was pressing
[03:27:57] [ __ ] that's from your
[03:28:01] scythe and
[03:28:04] then that's just the animation of eating
[03:28:07] it
[03:28:09] no wait let me look at what the
[03:28:11] animation looks like
[03:28:18] is that not just the animation of eating
[03:28:20] it I don't think it actually got
[03:28:23] bigger did I get gaset wait H this has
[03:28:26] three enemies is there FL has one enemy
[03:28:28] the reg wait eight is no eight is two
[03:28:30] enemies what this one dude they're all
[03:28:32] multiple
[03:28:34] enemies
[03:28:37] man man they're all one enemy I mean
[03:28:40] they're all more than one
[03:28:43] enemy let me go here
[03:28:49] based on the size of the bar yeah I it
[03:28:51] doesn't look like it's enough that's why
[03:28:53] I said it wasn't but I was like maybe
[03:28:54] they don't have Scythe but they have
[03:28:55] Scythe wait let me look let me look I'm
[03:28:57] still curious about the animation
[03:29:01] though all like you know just makes it
[03:29:03] look like that no matter what right
[03:29:09] look yeah
[03:29:22] yeah okay never mind I don't think you
[03:29:31] cooked cuz that's just animation of
[03:29:33] eating
[03:29:37] it yeah okay yeah you didn't get it yeah
[03:29:42] yeah he has Scythe too
[03:29:46] although granted you bursted here wait

[03:30:23] uh wait so you're playing hyper Bloom em
[03:30:26] Ryden I assume uh I don't really
[03:30:30] understand the point of finina here I'm
[03:30:32] going to be honest I mean she does
[03:30:35] damage
[03:30:38] okay

[03:31:04] crit wait let me look at the damage
[03:31:06] numbers I wasn't paying attention you're
[03:31:08] hyper bloming for was that like
[03:31:11] 7K the quality is a bit yeah uh 12K
[03:31:16] hyper blooms that
[03:31:20] is I mean a little concerning let me
[03:31:23] look at your right in
[03:31:25] build I just saw an emblem feather oh my
[03:31:28] God she's

[03:31:32] seen in my
[03:31:36] life what is this I mean that's pretty
[03:31:41] good you're on it okay what are you
[03:31:45] If You're Gonna Play like a crit Ryden
[03:31:48] why are you playing a hyper Bloom
[03:31:52] team your Goblin plus
[03:31:55] 16 that's fine maybe you're like low AR
[03:31:57] that's okay level
[03:32:00] 70 bro you're

[03:32:20] it's not like you're new then uh
[03:32:22] definitely level your [ __ ] you have
[03:32:24] enough artifacts where you probably
[03:32:25] chose to farm artifacts instead of
[03:32:27] leveling things you definitely need to
[03:32:28] level things um like level your weapons
[03:32:32] I don't know if your talents are leveled
[03:32:34] are your talents leveled you didn't show

[03:46:24] a random party in your Chevy clear
[03:46:25] though something's not up like look
[03:46:28] let's say like I feel like each of your
[03:46:29] rotations don't have either like a like
[03:46:33] you just pressed e on Chevy sorry you
[03:46:35] pressed e on [ __ ] chlorin without
[03:46:37] Chevy eing or shanglin powering like I
[03:46:39] feel like your pado has like two up time
[03:46:41] every 100 seconds
[03:46:45] okay give me something I can actually I
[03:46:46] can actually watch
[03:46:51] cheating please tell me this person
[03:46:53] actually shows the teams and the
[03:46:55] characters they have Okay cool so we can
[03:46:58] dive into your team building thought
[03:46:59] process
[03:47:00] okay Navia I like it Navia finina
[03:47:04] Bennett Jong Le okay good team provided
[03:47:06] your Bennett has enough healing I would
[03:47:07] run him like maybe song of days past or
[03:47:09] something uh good team
[03:47:12] okay uh yeah your characters all being
[03:47:14] level eight is a bit concerning
[03:47:16] especially a HP scaler like finina but
[03:47:19] it's okay let's keep
[03:47:21] watching wait are you low AR what's your
[03:47:23] AR 59 never mind wait what 59 you don't
[03:47:27] have a level 90 why is your Kazo 80
[03:47:29] anyways let's keep
[03:47:35] watching what what are
[03:47:38] you
[03:47:40] honestly okay I actually kind of respect
[03:47:43] this uh actually no I don't you're
[03:47:45] playing hyper Bloom on a level 80
[03:47:46] character you lose like 30%
[03:47:50] damage please level 90 your characters
[03:47:52] not everyone not everyone needs to be 90
[03:47:54] but for some reactions like hyper Bloom
[03:47:56] definitely level
[03:47:57] 90 uh HP scalers as well yolan finina
[03:48:01] even Nita cuz em like might be proing
[03:48:04] the reactions but yeah your teams are
[03:48:06] good your teams are actually good so
[03:48:07] let's see what
[03:48:13] happens ER that's fine uh do you need it
[03:48:16] yeah finina I don't know how much you
[03:48:18] have but yeah
[03:48:24] sure wait what what what what did you
[03:48:28] just okay okay you can't am
[03:48:34] I you can't apply Geo like there's no
[03:48:38] like you can put Geo on like let's say a
[03:48:40] character has Hydro you can apply Gio on
[03:48:42] it but if you can't like put a Geo or on
[03:48:45] enemies so ether did literally nothing
[03:48:47] what you want to do here is you Q on
[03:48:49] Navia okay you burst then you swap you
[03:48:51] can do finina you could do Jong Le
[03:48:53] although you probably want an element to
[03:48:55] be out so you would do Q here and then
[03:48:57] swap the I get it like okay by the time
[03:48:59] you go back to Navia your e might be up
[03:49:01] so whatever but like literally it does
[03:49:03] nothing just two you definitely burst
[03:49:06] and then you go for Reena you can't E I
[03:49:09] mean you can but like you you can't do
[03:49:12] this this is wrong
[03:49:18] also you have no
[03:49:22] stamina for particle funneling okay who
[03:49:25] did they funnel it
[03:49:28] to exactly I'm not saying never e I'm
[03:49:33] saying this was wrong if you want to e
[03:49:35] this is what you do you start first of
[03:49:37] all more stamina you do EQ like you need
[03:49:39] to Q that's the important part you can e
[03:49:41] if you want but q and then I would go to
[03:49:44] a character that applies an elements so
[03:49:45] you passively crystallize so I would do
[03:49:47] like finina EQ or like something like
[03:49:49] that if you have fishal you could fishal
[03:49:50] you could bet it you could whatever but
[03:49:51] like let's say finina EQ then you can
[03:49:54] like B it okay this is fine you have
[03:49:56] your Shield up this is fine this is
[03:50:05] fine okay navus hold e oh sorry nav's e
[03:50:11] does is not only most of her damage a
[03:50:13] big it's like a UL burst a mini Ula
[03:50:15] burst it also does way more when you
[03:50:17] have three bullets or more okay ideally
[03:50:19] six but even three here you have two and
[03:50:22] you tap so it does like nothing then you
[03:50:26] hold and you don't even
[03:50:30] wait holding Ian Avia does nothing if
[03:50:32] you don't wait for the bullets to come
[03:50:34] the crystallize to come to
[03:50:39] you now you have bullets but you don't
[03:50:41] have your e also wait why is everything
[03:50:43] pyro what the [ __ ] is is
[03:50:48] happening wait what am I seeing why is
[03:50:52] your
[03:50:54] Navia why are you just pyro Navia I know
[03:50:58] it's beted but like I feel like there's
[03:51:00] a better rotation than the Pyro attack
[03:51:02] on Navia I mean whatever I guess you got
[03:51:05] the job
[03:51:06] done
[03:51:09] okay sure
[03:51:16] I don't like Bennett before finina
[03:51:18] because uh Bennett burst doesn't last as
[03:51:21] long but it's
[03:51:24] okay you didn't strongly
[03:51:28] Shield that was a pretty bad rotation
[03:51:37] whatever still not jly
[03:51:43] shielded yeah this is really bad like
[03:51:45] your your benett so what did your benett
[03:51:47] Al actually buff your Ben Al buffed one
[03:51:50] Navia e that's it and like random
[03:51:52] normals you got to stop wasting benol
[03:51:54] like you want to rotate by doing Navia
[03:51:56] burst and then you go through like let's
[03:51:58] say finina EQ Jong Le Shield then you
[03:52:00] can benol and then you go to Navi and
[03:52:03] you'll have two charges of e and you
[03:52:05] have like good up time on it you could E
[03:52:07] Auto five times e like N3 Das
[03:52:12] N2 like this next yeah that next is's
[03:52:15] not
[03:52:19] buffed okay that finina voice line is
[03:52:22] very
[03:52:32] cute okay
[03:52:38] sure wait this might be the first time
[03:52:40] you swapped an AIA with two charges on
[03:52:41] your e holy [ __ ] never mind
[03:52:44] have you ever sorry have you ever had
[03:52:48] two charges on Navia in this entire run
[03:52:51] bro why every time you swap through you
[03:52:52] have one
[03:53:04] charge okay you swap your rotations are
[03:53:06] too short okay what you want to do is
[03:53:08] like you start with Navia burst but
[03:53:10] outside of that swap through all of your
[03:53:12] supports then go to Navia and then
[03:53:14] you'll have your charges ready you'll
[03:53:16] have two or you'll have one and by the
[03:53:18] time you do like your e Autos your
[03:53:19] second one will come up usually that's
[03:53:22] kind of how it
[03:53:26] goes anyways let's uh let's go to
[03:53:29] another one actually let me look at your
[03:53:32] builds why didn't me look at your second
[03:53:34] half let me watch your second
[03:53:37] half that's fine you could have just ran
[03:53:39] up and tapped but it's okay this is fine
[03:53:42] good placement of the E Auto you can e
[03:53:43] again please don't eat the somr okay you
[03:53:45] didn't e it's
[03:53:46] fine it's fine can you Cookie yep the
[03:53:51] Autos Yep this is
[03:53:56] fine you could have broken The Shield
[03:53:58] better but whatever I'm not going to
[03:54:00] judge you this is okay
[03:54:06] sure okay
[03:54:10] I
[03:54:12] okay um
[03:54:18] it took you look no disrespect at all
[03:54:20] okay genuinely no disrespect but it took
[03:54:22] you let's count the time from
[03:54:25] 7:36
[03:54:30] until let's
[03:54:33] see until 7:22 so like 14 seconds before
[03:54:37] you apply dendro just so you know uh cuz
[03:54:40] you could have just pressed the under
[03:54:42] but it's fine here you got it okay
[03:54:48] sure uh a you're not going to group them
[03:54:51] oh wait you might actually grou them yes
[03:54:53] yes yes yes shoot them that way

[03:55:06] them grouped look look look okay if you
[03:55:11] keep attacking this guy from here
[03:55:12] they'll group up okay cuz they go back
[03:55:14] backwards just keep attacking him here
[03:55:16] he's going to group and then you you
[03:55:18] move why did you
[03:55:28] move okay let's let's skip forward let's
[03:55:31] look at your builds
[03:55:33] Navia Mar very good with finina very
[03:55:37] good okay you don't have to exit out to
[03:55:40] show each bro you you can just click on
[03:55:42] the you don't have to press Escape
[03:55:44] between every
[03:55:54] artifact that's a lot of crit rate 62
[03:55:57] plus 36 that's like
[03:56:01] 100 what the [ __ ] just
[03:56:05] happened
[03:56:08] okay okay
[03:56:14] it's fine that's good that's good that's
[03:56:16] a really good flower that's a good
[03:56:20] feather that's that's not bad if you
[03:56:23] need wait don't you have Fu sound
[03:56:24] Fairman or did I see things wait no way
[03:56:27] you need more er no way you need wait
[03:56:29] okay ferina can need a lot of ER but
[03:56:32] wait what was your team
[03:56:36] again wait you weren't even oh yeah it's
[03:56:39] the Navia one Navia Ben Jong okay you
[03:56:43] don't have the most energy yeah yeah
[03:56:44] okay sure but okay honestly sure yeah
[03:56:47] you might you might no no you might you
[03:56:48] might you don't have official in the
[03:56:49] Navia team and jong's probably if jong's
[03:56:51] on fa we'll look later okay that's good
[03:56:55] we already saw this that's
[03:56:57] good ER sand I respect ER sanss it's
[03:57:00] fine okay
[03:57:03] goblet goblet show me your
[03:57:05] goblet HP that's a really good
[03:57:10] goblet wait there's actually a good
[03:57:12] finina
[03:57:16] wait this is fine like you have 210 ER
[03:57:21] like assuming you actually need that
[03:57:22] although you probably can get away with
[03:57:24] a bit less but
[03:57:25] anyways I don't know if you have like
[03:57:27] favs or anything on your
[03:57:30] team how much y does your Ben
[03:57:34] have yeah that's fine J Le wait you are
[03:57:38] on five R2 but still
[03:57:44] 181 honestly that's probably the best
[03:57:46] part of your account so
[03:57:48] far sack frags R1 that's good deepwood
[03:57:51] that's
[03:57:53] good
[03:57:57] good I mean that's not ideal it's fine
[03:58:00] that's
[03:58:02] fine okay this is fine uh yeah it's okay
[03:58:06] your builds are okay I don't need to
[03:58:08] look at this wait let me look at your
[03:58:09] cookie make sure she's on fully
[03:58:12] am yeah okay okay it's
[03:58:16] fine wait what was wrong Leon I didn't
[03:58:18] look at
[03:58:19] sets okay it's fine I mean no it's not
[03:58:22] what the uh you definitely want like MTH
[03:58:24] or something on him uh even Petro with
[03:58:27] finina is okay if if you want and pick
[03:58:30] up a hydr crystal but like Petro MTH
[03:58:32] would be good here um but like yeah it
[03:58:35] doesn't really matter like it's okay if
[03:58:37] you're just on sub
[03:58:40] stats I don't know why your characters
[03:58:42] are 90 though especially Kookie like
[03:58:44] Kookie not being 90 is a huge DPS loss
[03:58:47] for hyper bloom all right next one herid
[03:58:52] fish cycle from five months ago okay
[03:58:56] maybe
[03:58:58] not returning player here Shain uhoh
[03:59:02] wait let's look at this [ __ ] returning
[03:59:05] player 30 Stars okay you actually need
[03:59:08] help I got you man I got you we're going
[03:59:10] to save we're going to save a
[03:59:12] viewer oh this is the worst TR team I've
[03:59:15] ever
[03:59:16] seen oh no oh
[03:59:20] [ __ ] oh
[03:59:25] [ __ ]
[03:59:30] um be nice okay no I'm actually going to
[03:59:32] be nice okay even for a 1.0 sha player
[03:59:35] sucros should be in your team Shia
[03:59:38] sucros and then ideally like like bened
[03:59:40] Jong Le pretty good 1.1 team uh it
[03:59:44] wouldn't be good for the second half of
[03:59:45] this Abyss because enemies you need
[03:59:47] Hydro obviously
[03:59:50] um and I think dude my headset wire from
[03:59:53] when I chucked it earlier is Tangled
[03:59:56] I it's under my
[03:59:59] chair honestly uh I think Shia's a
[04:00:02] character now who gets way better with
[04:00:04] upgrades right so like I like him a lot
[04:00:06] this Abyss if you have like shenyun
[04:00:08] finina farzon you know stuff like that
[04:00:10] but if you want to play them I would do
[04:00:12] Shia s like without those I would do
[04:00:14] Shia sucros benett Jong Le first half or
[04:00:16] if you want to play second half you need
[04:00:17] hydro and honestly I would probably play
[04:00:19] another DPS at that point um now please
[04:00:23] edit this out of the YouTube video
[04:00:25] however I don't know how the only five
[04:00:27] star DPSS you
[04:00:29] have outside of like Shia you have
[04:00:33] what brother like like pull for better
[04:00:36] characters I'm sorry I'm sorry no I'm
[04:00:38] kidding you don't need to you have the H
[04:00:41] uh you could play like hyper Bloom you
[04:00:42] can play Shang Ling you could play you
[04:00:43] know you have
[04:00:44] but look
[04:00:48] um they're a returning player okay I
[04:00:52] guess that was kind of [ __ ] well I
[04:00:53] mean you
[04:00:58] have okay that was actually kind of
[04:01:00] [ __ ] I'm sorry I'm
[04:01:05] sorry let me let me actually think if
[04:01:07] I'm you what do I do here okay if I want
[04:01:09] to play Shia I do Shia sucros benad Dr
[04:01:12] Le first half second half I play either
[04:01:14] some like hyper bloom or taser thing
[04:01:16] something with a lot of hydro now it
[04:01:17] doesn't look like you have the best
[04:01:18] Hydro like you don't have the most
[04:01:20] obviously you have SRO even Mona if you
[04:01:22] need double Hydro uh I don't know if you
[04:01:24] have other hydros you didn't scroll down
[04:01:25] but like this Abyss is kind of punishing
[04:01:28] because you don't have that much Hydro
[04:01:29] let's say it's a normal as abys I play
[04:01:31] Nikita SRO em Ryden and then Flex last
[04:01:36] slot or like Kookie instead of yeah you
[04:01:38] have Kookie you can do Kookie instead of
[04:01:39] riding if you want to uh and then
[04:01:41] someone on field and you're chilling
[04:01:44] uh for this Abyss though you probably
[04:01:46] need I would do I would do literally
[04:01:49] this might be a bad take but I would do
[04:01:50] Nikita SRO Kookie second half and then I
[04:01:55] would play something that gives me more
[04:01:57] Hydro so you could do like a Mona just
[04:01:59] to literally onfield the Pyro electors
[04:02:02] or I would do
[04:02:03] like bet like bet is not Hydro but
[04:02:07] Electro is honestly pretty good even at
[04:02:09] breaking it yeah you could Barbara as
[04:02:10] well uh with em Ryden if you do Barbara
[04:02:12] that's a Healer so you can run
[04:02:14] Ryden uh something like
[04:02:18] that and if you yeah I mean that's fine
[04:02:21] let's watch your
[04:02:22] clear wait what just happened all right
[04:02:25] let's
[04:02:31] watch official official's fine FAL
[04:02:34] steals a bit of hyper blooms but she
[04:02:35] still works yeah oh unless me yeah yeah
[04:02:38] she just still
[04:02:41] work that's fine this is fine make sure
[04:02:45] you okay so this might not happen but I
[04:02:48] predict that because of Nita's because
[04:02:50] you Nita before you swirled you're going
[04:02:52] to miss your Electro swirl and you're
[04:02:53] going to swirl dendro which does nothing
[04:02:55] that's my
[04:02:57] guess never mind you swirled Electro
[04:02:59] you're the [ __ ] best player in the
[04:03:07] world I guess it's cuz you
[04:03:09] rened okay this is good good
[04:03:12] rotation this is good this is actually
[04:03:14] good you cleared fast good job well
[04:03:16] played okay that's fine official yep SP
[04:03:20] that
[04:03:24] [ __ ] this is good okay you didn't do
[04:03:27] much damage there but it's
[04:03:32] fine yep this is fine you going have to
[04:03:34] do a new rotation
[04:03:38] unfortunate yep you marked them
[04:03:45] uh I don't think you swirled Electro
[04:03:47] there on the other run grader like on
[04:03:49] that one in the
[04:03:50] back did you oh maybe you
[04:03:58] did I
[04:04:02] anyway okay there you definitely like
[04:04:04] there I would have reset you you want to
[04:04:06] uh you want your Riders to hit both it
[04:04:08] only hit one all good
[04:04:14] this is going to be [ __ ] annoying
[04:04:16] these enemies are not
[04:04:24] fun why is everyone typing EU EDM oh
[04:04:27] Drake's playing sorry
[04:04:30] sorry
[04:04:35] nice I can never group these run graders
[04:04:38] yeah they're annoying I I agree they're
[04:04:39] annoying honestly you're playing fine
[04:04:41] like that was just one mistake it's okay
[04:04:44] here you marked them yep oh okay
[04:04:46] actually normally that's fine but
[04:04:48] they're about to summon two enemies so
[04:04:49] you would save your mark like you want
[04:04:50] to Mark those guys too so you should
[04:04:52] have waited it's okay though did you
[04:04:55] swap no did you mark them again you swap
[04:04:59] the Nita no that's fine you might just
[04:05:02] reinforce them your burst
[04:05:04] missed
[04:05:06] unlucky well it's
[04:05:10] fine um
[04:05:15] yeah it's fine you should have marked
[04:05:18] them
[04:05:19] but also you didn't need to genan burst
[04:05:22] there I would have just R end it fine
[04:05:24] okay let's see the next half all right
[04:05:26] let's see what the [ __ ] you do with dude
[04:05:28] Shia with no anemo battery is crazy this
[04:05:31] might be the worst sh gameplay I'm ever
[04:05:33] going to see let's see okay I wouldn't
[04:05:35] have strongly bursted but it's fine yep
[04:05:38] that's fine
[04:05:46] this is
[04:05:47] good you need to hit the other Shield
[04:05:50] though
[04:05:54] ah someone said Grandpa
[04:05:59] rotation bro what are you attacking I'm
[04:06:02] sorry I'm
[04:06:04] [Music]
[04:06:09] sorry no I mean
[04:06:17] okay it's fine I'm not going to judge
[04:06:19] you for that but it's
[04:06:23] okay okay
[04:06:27] Shields damn you have like no oh do you
[04:06:30] have enough energy let's
[04:06:35] see you didn't B burst yeah you really
[04:06:38] need to B burst that okay yeah uh yeah
[04:06:43] this
[04:06:46] is why is there like a delay are you are
[04:06:49] you on PC I feel like there's a delay
[04:06:50] between when you click stuff and you do
[04:06:52] stuff and your ping is not that high
[04:06:54] like look you burst here and then
[04:06:55] there's like
[04:06:56] a like like what are you doing for that
[04:06:59] like look I'm sorry but I feel like
[04:07:00] there's a 1 second
[04:07:02] delay it happens when you swap
[04:07:04] characters too
[04:07:15] like
[04:07:19] look I don't know also I haven't seen
[04:07:22] your sh
[04:07:26] plunge like like okay like no disrespect
[04:07:29] but here for example oh your e on cool
[04:07:32] down okay never
[04:07:41] mind like okay look I'm not trying to
[04:07:44] Flame you but like look you swap and
[04:07:47] then he look he just stands
[04:07:55] there yeah I think you're not Dash C
[04:07:57] like things I don't
[04:08:02] know no I mean it's all good you don't
[04:08:04] have to like sweat
[04:08:06] but just make sure you plunge on sh
[04:08:10] oh it's fine
[04:08:15] okay I don't know about
[04:08:19] you're wow okay this if I saw this as
[04:08:23] like my first child gameplay I it's okay
[04:08:27] it's all good I mean okay you want
[04:08:29] genuine advice I think your rotations
[04:08:30] can be smoother try to animation cancel
[04:08:32] things and try to
[04:08:36] um oh maybe they are on moob no there's
[04:08:38] a mouse that's a mouse
[04:08:44] all right let me look at your builds
[04:08:46] lithic is good in that team because
[04:08:48] you're running Jong leing
[04:08:51] troll wait did you not show your
[04:08:52] artifacts oh you don't show the
[04:09:03] ones
[04:09:05] yeah like you're R in gameplay was
[04:09:08] actually pretty good I'm not joking your
[04:09:09] Ren was fine your Shia I don't really
[04:09:11] know what you're doing like why you
[04:09:13] plunging wait how did that guy get there
[04:09:16] what the
[04:09:22] [ __ ] okay here run to the right or the
[04:09:25] left so they group don't go to the
[04:09:29] middle
[04:09:32] okay yep I mean you could s before
[04:09:34] Bennett but it's fine
[04:09:38] yep
[04:09:41] okay you you you
[04:09:49] like you just you see what just happened
[04:09:51] use your Bennett burst for nothing and
[04:09:52] then you sh burst it outside of
[04:09:55] Bennett so um yeah your writing gameplay
[04:09:58] was fine though new pc player stated in
[04:10:04] description they
[04:10:08] wrote they didn't write in description
[04:10:10] also Oh you mean the like the this part
[04:10:14] maybe they call the video
[04:10:20] zabal was that far down damage is e I
[04:10:23] mean yeah but it's not 40K it's still
[04:10:27] like 100 well okay it's not necessarily
[04:10:30] I'm not going to pretend you have the
[04:10:31] best artifacts in the world but like
[04:10:32] it's definitely higher than
[04:10:37] that
[04:10:39] um I
[04:10:43] that one scared me I'm sorry I've been
[04:10:46] playing gen since the first loss and I
[04:10:47] still can't fully do Abyss I don't know
[04:10:49] how to improve okay okay I won't I will
[04:10:51] be nice for this one I will be nice for
[04:10:53] this one oh my God you pulled Siege
[04:10:56] win I'm sorry I'm sorry um okay let's
[04:11:00] let's look at your team okay so you got
[04:11:02] finina Nita
[04:11:04] oh it's
[04:11:08] okay okay I'm going to tell you right
[04:11:10] now I don't even care what your
[04:11:11] artifacts are for the current if you put
[04:11:13] nevet second half you win boom you clear
[04:11:16] if you literally just put nlet finina
[04:11:18] and then two random characters you can
[04:11:20] get the stars for the second half at
[04:11:22] least it'll be a lot
[04:11:24] better okay it's not that easy but
[04:11:28] yeah um your cookie level 80 so that's a
[04:11:32] huge chunk of DPS you're losing finina
[04:11:35] solo Hydro is probably not the best idea
[04:11:37] I would
[04:11:39] um yeah
[04:11:45] what is
[04:11:49] happening wait what am I looking
[04:11:54] at wait what is this nalet kazua
[04:11:57] shanglin Bennett honestly
[04:11:59] sure uh but I would I would do net like
[04:12:02] a nevet double Hydro forina team second
[04:12:04] half instead you have a lot of DPSS to
[04:12:06] choose from so you don't need to run
[04:12:08] wait who even is auto attacking second
[04:12:10] half baiju
[04:12:14] you don't need that you could put like
[04:12:16] let's say you put nevet finina there
[04:12:18] first half if you want a hyper Bloom
[04:12:20] team you could do um well you have an IO
[04:12:23] right there chilling you can do like Ayo
[04:12:25] Nita kuki any last character uh works
[04:12:29] exactly you even play uh Navia or like
[04:12:31] scar or something but or alyam you have
[04:12:34] alyam I didn't even see alyam yeah you
[04:12:36] can definitely play Alam also Ki should
[04:12:38] be level
[04:12:41] 90 okay let's keep
[04:12:48] watching all right let's look at this
[04:12:50] game
[04:12:54] play that's good that's fine swirl that
[04:12:57] [ __ ] yep yep yep this is okay you have a
[04:13:00] fa kaawa I like
[04:13:03] it uh I will say
[04:13:05] though actually no I'm not going to say
[04:13:07] anything let's just watch this is fine I
[04:13:09] I worry about your shang's particles cuz
[04:13:12] you bursted on her after after your five
[04:13:14] um but it's
[04:13:16] okay this is okay you could have swirled
[04:13:18] Hydra there though but it's
[04:13:21] fine is J me burst I don't recommend
[04:13:25] it this okay you got the swirl you got
[04:13:28] the swirl I would funnel particles to
[04:13:30] Shin L nice okay you know what you're
[04:13:34] doing this is fine apply Hydro on the
[04:13:37] what are you doing what are you doing
[04:13:38] it's okay you're on mobile I'm not going
[04:13:39] to judge
[04:13:41] you um
[04:13:44] um there's like 26 droplets to your left
[04:13:46] buddy you can okay pyro
[04:13:52] swirl okay you didn't hydr srl you can
[04:13:54] hydr right now okay nice there's
[04:13:56] definitely still droplets though never
[04:14:06] mind okay this nevet damage is
[04:14:11] uh it's like
[04:14:17] it's okay it's okay that
[04:14:22] e yo Ste you can okay please swirl Hydro
[04:14:26] all you need to do is one nevet attack
[04:14:30] all you needed to do here was just Auto
[04:14:32] on at
[04:14:34] once it's okay though it's
[04:14:39] fine here the Pyro infusion on K is
[04:14:42] pretty good though because you you can
[04:14:43] Vape on your nevet so that's good um you
[04:14:47] would want to line the enemies up though
[04:14:48] with your be what the
[04:14:50] [ __ ] bro what are you
[04:14:56] doing goodbye it's okay but you don't
[04:14:59] need to like wait for nevet to charge

[04:15:02] enough ER I mean you missed a few charge
[04:15:04] attacks it's okay just please don't
[04:15:06] waste balls okay if you if you use nevet
[04:15:09] look nevet burst gives you three charge
[04:15:12] attacks for free you don't have to wait
[04:15:14] that wasn't that bad it wasn't that bad
[04:15:16] so to be fair it wasn't that bad but
[04:15:18] like here for example you do one charge
[04:15:20] attack which is good like so far this is
[04:15:22] good but then here there's a lot of
[04:15:24] balls on the ground I'm pretty sure you

[04:15:56] have enough Hydra application for this
[04:15:57] floor though only forina is uh not

[04:18:50] not being 90 is a huge DPS loss by the
[04:18:52] way yeah you just need to level stuff

[04:19:03] me proceed with caution all
[04:19:08] right Alam yolan syro CI net finina BYU
[04:19:14] how did you not 36 star these teams are
[04:19:16] actually
[04:19:18] good oh wait I think I actually played
[04:19:20] this team and then I was like
[04:19:22] [ __ ] I don't know why I'm running double
[04:19:23] hydro and then I swapped
[04:19:27] it what the [ __ ] is
[04:19:32] this what just
[04:19:37] happened kill
[04:19:40] him kie level 80 again brother can we
[04:19:44] can we tell people to level 90 cookie it
[04:19:49] matters anyways your teams are
[04:19:54] fine let's
[04:19:57] watch let's see what the issue is cuz I
[04:19:59] don't know em car that's
[04:20:07] good okay I mean
[04:20:11] sure bro I mean
[04:20:27] okay Alam gains three mirrors when he
[04:20:31] ults okay let me explain to you an alyam
[04:20:34] rotation people say alam's complicated
[04:20:35] he's really not that complicated you
[04:20:37] want to use your burst if you have it
[04:20:39] then you do well use your supports first
[04:20:42] you burst then you Auto attack three
[04:20:45] mirors Auto attack three meters then
[04:20:47] after around four seconds you press your
[04:20:50] e or you do a charge attack then you'll
[04:20:52] get another mirror you'll stay at three
[04:20:54] then you do the other one after 4
[04:20:56] seconds again you have another three
[04:20:57] you're chilling that's all you need to
[04:20:58] know if you burst and you e at the same
[04:21:01] time and you plunge then you're wasting
[04:21:03] all your mirrors you just generated six
[04:21:05] but you capped at
[04:21:11] three so now you you're already at two
[04:21:13] mirrors and now you're at one mirror and
[04:21:14] now you're all hyms useless and you have
[04:21:16] no cool
[04:21:21] downs but what is bro
[04:21:25] fighting um
[04:21:34] yeah alt then e question mark not really
[04:21:37] you Al then you normal attack then you e
[04:21:39] then you normal attack then you uh like
[04:21:41] normal attack for 4 seconds then you e
[04:21:43] then you normal attack for 4 seconds
[04:21:44] then you charge attack that's
[04:21:53] all all right let's skip ahead let's see
[04:21:56] your next
[04:21:58] rotation all right you set things up
[04:22:00] burst this is fine don't press e hey you
[04:22:02] did it okay wait this is good I mean the
[04:22:04] enemies aren't grouped you should group
[04:22:05] them but at least your rotation is
[04:22:07] better now you should you should
[04:22:08] definitely press e though you only have
[04:22:09] two mirrors you're at you still have two
[04:22:11] mirrors okay okay okay you're back to
[04:22:14] three well you have no
[04:22:19] Hydro I never use them

[04:22:38] combo with no El this one and I was like
[04:22:41] Z reacts to cave

[04:32:35] um
[04:32:40] um for the shield
[04:32:44] yeah I
[04:32:46] mean that's

[04:32:52] but I get
[04:32:59] it wait let me see your second
[04:33:07] team wow okay let me see the second team
[04:33:17] honestly this is not even that bad it
[04:33:20] just Charlotte should be someone else
[04:33:22] like Bennett s Navia boom already pretty
[04:33:25] good this you should probably have
[04:33:26] another
[04:33:29] um yeah I I would try to get another
[04:33:31] like either a second Geo or official or
[04:33:33] something like that second team's not
[04:33:34] bad it's fine first team like you're
[04:33:37] almost there but you're effectively
[04:33:39] running two healers like you're running
[04:33:40] A shielder and A Healer Jean and kirar
[04:33:43] kind of have the same role I I like a
[04:33:44] shielder with wander so I would bench
[04:33:46] Jean if you have like Lila or you want a
[04:33:48] shielder maybe like C6 Toma you might
[04:33:51] not have C6 Toma but like something like
[04:33:52] that Jong Lee whatever uh I don't really
[04:33:55] like Jong Le there either I mean I guess
[04:33:57] he's fine I don't know what did you show

[04:34:13] oh you're like really low AR okay it's
[04:34:16] fine I like I'm not judging your
[04:34:18] gameplay I just think your team build so
[04:34:19] second team is fine first team you
[04:34:22] shouldn't run Jean here I don't think
[04:34:23] you should probably run with Scara you
[04:34:25] kind of want like either you build him
[04:34:28] like a Nemo hyper carry or you build
[04:34:29] them somewhat like a
[04:34:31] driver for other elements like so for
[04:34:35] example his like passive thing works
[04:34:37] well with like cryo so you could play
[04:34:38] him with like a cryo or two supports um
[04:34:42] and with that's one two is you could do
[04:34:47] I don't know who you have but you could
[04:34:48] play them like Singo or fishal or
[04:34:49] whatever or like
[04:34:51] Bennett uid wait I thought they censored
[04:34:54] it what the [ __ ]

[04:37:03] happened this is good good damage the
[04:37:07] etal I
[04:37:10] mean this is where you
[04:37:15] fall goodbye oh my oh my God oh my
[04:37:22] God wait what the
[04:37:29] [ __ ] we found the
[04:37:33] [Music]
[04:37:37] problem look no disrespect to Cole she
[04:37:40] can be good in a NE team she can be good
[04:37:42] a 15sec kaching team she can be used uh
[04:37:44] a few different places however for hyper
[04:37:47] Bloom especially with double hyro Cole
[04:37:50] is definitely not anywhere near enough
[04:37:52] dendro okay uh dendro main character
[04:37:55] would be significantly better you could
[04:37:57] if you have Nita or a better dendo
[04:37:59] character use them but even the dendro
[04:38:00] main character uh would be
[04:38:06] better like okay this is fine so far so
[04:38:10] good I would use your other SRO e though
[04:38:13] assuming your sack proc which I think it
[04:38:18] did yeah there's no you're playing
[04:38:20] electrocharge right now you are playing
[04:38:22] taser just so you
[04:38:27] know look it's my favorite clip
[04:38:39] farmer that was actually wait that was
[04:38:42] actually good grouping though that was
[04:38:45] actually good
[04:38:47] grouping look the charge attacking was
[04:38:50] funny but they actually grouped if you
[04:38:52] run to the wall the other dude does come
[04:38:54] to you so
[04:38:56] actually respectable I respect it okay
[04:39:00] you cooked apply Hydro here
[04:39:05] okay
[04:39:08] of this is honestly good that that was
[04:39:11] good rotation everything you did there
[04:39:13] was pretty
[04:39:16] good that was actually good okay ah good
[04:39:20] job that was
[04:39:21] good here you need to just Spam hydro
[04:39:24] and Kookie as well like Electro does a
[04:39:26] bit of damage to the shield too you got
[04:39:27] the s h no you didn't never
[04:39:29] mind yep yep yep yep yep make sure you
[04:39:34] uh honestly yeah you're doing
[04:39:38] fine yeah this is fine
[04:39:41] up battle world is all just like we
[04:39:46] rehearsed why o don't waste your D Drops
[04:39:49] oh you D's doing nothing ah that might
[04:39:51] have cost you it you're doing a bunch of
[04:39:53] dendro there that's applying you want to
[04:39:55] make sure you hydro like you want to be
[04:39:58] uh blooming with your dendro apps right
[04:40:00] there you did like a bunch of dendro
[04:40:01] that like this dendro isn't doing
[04:40:05] anything you should have
[04:40:07] hydro outside of that you're playing
[04:40:09] pretty well
[04:40:14] yeah like the rest is all fine but now
[04:40:15] you have no dandro see you're not going
[04:40:16] to bloom at all here no Bloom oh okay
[04:40:18] you swapped the
[04:40:20] [Music]
[04:40:25] colle
[04:40:26] yeah very close you honestly could get
[04:40:29] it you probably could still get it with
[04:40:30] this team if you reset and just do it a
[04:40:32] bit better you played pretty well
[04:40:35] there and your rotation was
[04:40:38] uh very fast like you did a short rot
[04:40:41] with which what you're supposed to do
[04:40:42] but yeah your burst kind of didn't do
[04:40:44] that
[04:40:47] much and
[04:40:51] yeah anyways how much ER does that K
[04:40:54] have probably a [ __ ] ton you got your

[04:45:28] 30.6 right yeah plus 21.8 that's over
[04:45:35] 50 that's 51.4 right
[04:45:41] and an attack roll I I don't like you I
[04:45:44] know it's not your fault that you're
[04:45:45] lucky but [ __ ]
[04:45:50] you please help and Bully me all you
[04:45:52] want okay all you have to
[04:45:56] say you have a royal weapon you have a
[04:45:59] [ __ ] I saw that [ __ ] oh no it's
[04:46:01] missive wind spear oh thank God I
[04:46:03] thought it was Royal spear
[04:46:16] okay okay okay
[04:46:20] okay yep
[04:46:25] yep wait you have 48 crit
[04:46:28] rate bro just go for wait um was your
[04:46:32] Circ crit damage yeah okay definitely go
[04:46:34] for a crit rate circlet that's number
[04:46:38] one or crit raid weapon but you probably
[04:46:41] don't have
[04:46:42] that double crown yon
[04:46:46] okay okay wait let me look at your wait
[04:46:49] I haven't seen your clear yet what are
[04:46:51] your
[04:46:55] teams arino
[04:47:06] right okay I mean if it's off field
[04:47:09] Ryden sure
[04:47:16] but you don't even have
[04:47:33] Chevy okay look I'm going to be
[04:47:37] honest I I know you just use Ryden as a
[04:47:40] burst support and I get it Ry in's hot
[04:47:43] however what your Ryden did here is
[04:47:46] effectively spend I don't know like
[04:47:47] maybe 2 seconds of verse animation to do
[04:47:51] 67k damage AOE okay sure it's not bad
[04:47:54] but like let's say you press ficial e
[04:47:56] it'll do like maybe 20 koe from the e
[04:47:59] and then it'll constantly be doing
[04:48:00] damage and applying Electro non-stop
[04:48:02] although in this team you don't even
[04:48:03] need Electro you can do mono power you
[04:48:04] can run like Shang Ling who would do
[04:48:05] probably the same damage but then
[04:48:07] instead of swap like when you swap out
[04:48:09] instead of that 60k stopping it keeps
[04:48:11] going and then it'll do like 40K 40K 40K
[04:48:13] 40K 40K but
[04:48:17] anyways so I don't recommend the Ryden
[04:48:19] here I actually don't like your Ryden
[04:48:21] did the exact same damage and you know
[04:48:23] no disrespect she did as much damage as
[04:48:26] this hit wait this
[04:48:34] one anyways uh I don't like riding on
[04:48:37] that
[04:48:39] team but my throw starting to get tired
[04:48:41] so we might have to continue this
[04:48:42] another
[04:48:47] day what's your second off Hut double
[04:48:50] Hydro Jang Le good
[04:48:52] team okay
[04:48:55] unlucky uh sure maybe weave a normal
[04:48:57] attack just to get some Hydro in maybe
[04:48:59] weave in a normal maybe weave a maybe we
[04:49:01] okay I mean now
[04:49:02] it's I feel like you're focusing too
[04:49:05] much here on like being optimal you're
[04:49:07] like not breaking their Shields like who
[04:49:08] gives a [ __ ] about your Hut's e just
[04:49:10] break their Shields with your
[04:49:15] hydro
[04:49:21] fine maybe if you didn't yell I can't
[04:49:24] yeah my throat
[04:49:25] [Music]
[04:49:30] hurts even here like I don't think I
[04:49:32] know jump cancelling is optimal if
[04:49:34] you're c z and you're probably see Zero
[04:49:36] but here like look they're both Hydro
[04:49:38] Dash through them Hut's AOE is not
[04:49:41] like in situations where you can Dash to
[04:49:43] the enemies it's pretty good because you
[04:49:44] can like yeah you can just hit both like
[04:49:47] you dash through both boom you dash
[04:49:48] through both boom kind of like a chlorin
[04:49:51] shot
[04:49:54] B
[04:49:56] anyways
[04:50:02] um okay let's look at the
[04:50:14] balls [ __ ] you hopeful let's look at
[04:50:22] the the Seth's clear check mine that you
