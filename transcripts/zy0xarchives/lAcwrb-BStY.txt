[00:06:27] set that is comparable in right but
[00:06:30] still a little worse okay no it's fine
[00:06:33] you're still a sh man you have vermilia
[00:06:34] it's fine and then they release a
[00:06:38] character who makes that other set
[00:06:41] better than villion it's okay it's
[00:06:45] okay it'll all go away
[00:06:48] soon oh you don't need it they say oh

[00:38:09] to make it public maybe that could be
[00:38:11] true personally I would like to hope
[00:38:14] that if there's
[00:38:15] ever an issue that I have with someone
[00:38:18] or that someone has with me we could
[00:38:19] resolve it
[00:38:21] privately I
[00:38:23] would hope that that is the case but I
[00:38:26] know that that's not always
[00:38:30] possible I know that zff called me short

[01:00:56] different how is this just a
[01:01:02] game I knew
[01:01:04] people in
[01:01:07] University man this program's too
[01:01:09] stressful for
[01:01:12] me it's all I do I'm so
[01:01:19] worried I know people who resorted to
[01:01:22] substance abusing
[01:01:29] ader all secondhand from people they
[01:01:31] don't even
[01:01:35] know that's not
[01:01:38] cool all your life turned into oh I need
[01:01:40] to get a good grade [ __ ] I won't make
[01:01:45] it the pressure is
[01:01:48] high and in those moments you need to
[01:01:51] take a step back hey is it worth it is
[01:01:54] this really all I
[01:01:57] have or is life more than just my score
[01:02:01] that rhymed right that down Andy donated
[01:02:05] $10 I would say it is give me water on
[01:02:07] Mr socks I would say it
[01:02:11] is because if you let your entire life
[01:02:14] be defined by how other people grade
[01:02:17] you then you're no better than them and
[01:02:20] you know better than
[01:02:23] that so today I'm going to roll an
[01:02:30] artifact and it will be a good one 7.8
[01:02:34] crit damage 7.8 crit damage 5.8
[01:02:43] attack actually a good take all my takes
[01:02:46] are
[01:02:47] good all of
[01:02:53] them I have cousins in Med sorry cousins
[01:02:57] resident doctors right now making
[01:02:59] [ __ ] no money until they they
[01:03:00] literally like working 50 hours a day no
[01:03:03] sleep have to operate on people get
[01:03:05] [ __ ] exploited till eventually they
[01:03:07] make money by exploiting the other
[01:03:09] [ __ ] people's there while the whole
[01:03:10] like all the med students are like what
[01:03:12] like [ __ ] depressed cuz all they
[01:03:13] [ __ ] need to do is study to get good
[01:03:15] grades and then they don't do [ __ ]
[01:03:17] except study so they get good gra and if
[01:03:18] they don't then there's the pressure to
[01:03:20] have to and then that's why the [ __ ]
[01:03:22] mental health in those places and the
[01:03:23] suicide r are very high which isn't cool
[01:03:25] so they said hey man don't go there
[01:03:28] don't do it and I did it I said do I
[01:03:29] want to be a doctor they said please
[01:03:31] don't I so I said okay I won't so you
[01:03:33] have to take a moment be like Z wait a
[01:03:35] second what are you telling me are you
[01:03:36] saying my life shouldn't be defined by
[01:03:38] just that that if I feel so pressure to
[01:03:40] perform maybe I should just okay this
[01:03:43] isn't everything hey maybe you know what
[01:03:46] this exam might go bad yeah I should
[01:03:48] still study but it's not the end of the
[01:03:52] world one bad exam [ __ ] maybe have to
[01:03:56] change degrees that's okay I'd rather
[01:03:59] change
[01:04:03] degrees and be
[01:04:06] sane then hate
[01:04:10] myself and
[01:04:13] graduate
[01:04:16] [ __ ] okay I that kind of ruined it

[01:09:13] this is what I have immigrant parents
[01:09:15] because it applies to a lot of different
[01:09:17] uh
[01:09:18] ethnicities they won't tell you

[01:23:13] sh you're [ __ ]
[01:23:21] private
[01:23:24] let's go on capar
[01:23:32] resin failed the IQ Shack LOL
[01:23:39] W what's the weapon recommendation for
[01:23:41] gaming Ser SP is the most broken weapon
[01:23:42] especially at R5 it's really good but
[01:23:44] even r1's really good because you can
[01:23:45] get Bennett who gives you attack which
[01:23:46] makes up for the low base stack it also
[01:23:47] has a high crit rate and the uh passive
[01:23:49] gives you a bunch of damage bonus like
[01:23:50] 30% or some [ __ ] but it's also so uh
[01:23:53] yeah you lose some stacks on field but
[01:23:54] typically even if you have at least
[01:23:55] three stacks it's really really strong
[01:23:56] and furthermore because it gives you
[01:23:58] damage bonus and crit that's especially
[01:23:59] good with shenyun who doesn't skill off
[01:24:01] um like your attack bonuses it doesn't
[01:24:03] matter too much cuz it's her attack
[01:24:04] added onto yours and then multiplied by
[01:24:06] your damage bonus and crit which means
[01:24:07] that weapons that give you crit are
[01:24:09] actually more valuable outside of ser SP
[01:24:10] you can go other five stars that are
[01:24:11] similar in strength most five stars are
[01:24:13] pretty good to one another especially
[01:24:14] the crit ones being slightly better like
[01:24:15] verdict like de weapon whatever the [ __ ]
[01:24:17] that one's called other [ __ ] like that
[01:24:19] but even the attack ones are fine uh and
[01:24:20] then right under the five stars are
[01:24:22] other fourstar options you go mailed
[01:24:23] flowers for free to play you could go
[01:24:24] the mellene sword for free to play uh
[01:24:26] but more on that in my ging guide which
[01:24:28] should have been out like 3 days ago I
[01:24:30] don't know when it's going to come out I
[01:24:31] haven't even finished recording it I
[01:24:32] literally I recorded okay I recorded
[01:24:35] like three quarters of gaming and then I
[01:24:37] was like wait I want to test some combo
[01:24:39] stuff and then I just slept all day
[01:24:41] yesterday and like left I literally got
[01:24:43] out of bed for like an hour I don't even
[01:24:45] know what I did I I did something I
[01:24:47] think I played Hearthstone Battlegrounds
[01:24:49] with Z Jeff that's it I think that's the
[01:24:51] only thing I did yesterday and then I
[01:24:52] went back to
[01:24:54] bed I think that's literally
[01:24:59] it time
[01:25:02] sh

[01:25:21] dead
[01:25:24] teamwork is
[01:25:25] DreamWork my name
[01:25:33] e what if kaching had two swords you
[01:25:35] mean [ __ ]
[01:25:38] chori
[01:25:43] sus
[01:25:51] sus
[01:25:53] updated y guide I literally made a
[01:25:56] recent y guide y guide
[01:25:58] Zio look ultimate y Miko guy wait this
[01:26:02] is 2022 what the [ __ ] no no there's
[01:26:05] another one wait no wait what okay it's
[01:26:09] the end of 2022 that's literally like a
[01:26:11] year okay maybe I could make another but
[01:26:13] this is updated with dendro last guide
[01:26:16] has gotten much better indirectly
[01:26:17] through the release of the dendro
[01:26:19] element which she honestly has some
[01:26:21] really good Synergy with I explain that
[01:26:22] in my last video but in today's video
[01:26:24] I'm going to be focusing on everything
[01:26:25] you need to know about how to build and
[01:26:27] play y Pro efficiently covering her best
[01:26:29] play yeah kind of golden pineapple I
[01:26:31] know the nil one is really good um like
[01:26:34] okay I was looking at it the nil one um
[01:26:37] only don't ask why and I was like it
[01:26:39] looks good but if you need uh effect hit
[01:26:42] rate on a character you might want to go
[01:26:43] for effect hit rate lone instead but if
[01:26:45] you don't need the effect hit rate it's
[01:26:47] actually a lot of stats for free to play
[01:26:48] likeon so I really like it but like
[01:26:49] let's say you're playing an effect hit
[01:26:50] rate needing nil character character
[01:26:52] then I would rather go to effect hit
[01:26:54] Leone like another one but you know uh
[01:26:56] how would I know
[01:27:11] sorry same two song playlist wait what
[01:27:15] go back to your same okay I'll stopped
[01:27:16] this one song I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
[01:27:18] sorry I have become
[01:27:21] death
[01:27:24] there's no music if I play daao I know
[01:27:27] people are going to start crying I'm not
[01:27:28] going to do this I'm not going to play
[01:27:29] honai if I play Hong Guai third music

[01:27:32] start crying
[01:27:40] [Music]
[01:27:43] Wildfire play Pirate
[01:27:50] song did I remember listening to this
[01:27:52] the first time live this was so hyped
[01:27:55] top one star rail moment for me so
[01:28:08] far ow fantia was also kind of
[01:28:14] lit
[01:28:17] me it
[01:28:21] up
[01:28:27] what okay this is your first message so
[01:28:30] I don't want to Dono all you however I
[01:28:33] have no clue what a web event is I'm
[01:28:35] going to be real I can't remember the
[01:28:38] last web event I did I'm I'm being
[01:28:40] honest I could lie to you I could I'm
[01:28:43] not like that I could I'm not I'm not
[01:28:45] like that I don't know what the [ __ ] to
[01:28:47] do for a web event I'mma Be Real I'mma
[01:28:50] Be Real
[01:28:54] are you excited for Sam acaron sexine
[01:28:57] and peny why would I read that I
[01:29:00] actually I thought you were going to ask
[01:29:02] are you excited for Sam like in general
[01:29:04] and I was going to say yes but then I
[01:29:05] read the rest of your sentence and now I
[01:29:07] regret reading the rest of your
[01:29:12] sentence link please to
[01:29:15] [Applause]
[01:29:16] what what the [ __ ] are you
[01:29:20] sorry
[01:29:26] how should he had aend of the new
[01:29:28] presets
[01:29:29] yeah yeah
[01:29:36] yeah
[01:29:39] okay sorry biased answer zero out of 10
[01:29:44] if they're going to release presets you
[01:29:45] might as well release good ones that's
[01:29:46] the biased answer objective answer is
[01:29:49] they suck but for some characters they
[01:29:52] can work like if you need the same main
[01:29:54] stats on everything like shenyun who
[01:29:55] could go between two sets you could just
[01:29:57] have the main sets there and then you
[01:29:58] just click you change the set and it's
[01:29:59] faster still sucks but it's better than
[01:30:01] nothing for that whereas personally I
[01:30:04] I'm just going to play the song I'm

[01:30:43] debating law school and OD how do you
[01:30:44] say your experience was oh I I okay I'm
[01:30:46] still last year I didn't really finish
[01:30:49] but I was on the dean list I had good
[01:30:51] grades anyways uh I enjoy it I think
[01:30:53] it's fun I meet people it was cool it
[01:30:56] was fun I did I but I'm a very like I
[01:30:59] minmax my effort like I didn't like
[01:31:01] study a crazy amount I would like speed
[01:31:04] through the like you learn how to like
[01:31:06] speedrun stuff like you learn what you
[01:31:09] need to read and what you don't need to
[01:31:10] read in Court decisions
[01:31:12] like anyways I liked
[01:31:14] it but a lot of people find it very
[01:31:16] stressful so it's up to you I don't
[01:31:18] think it's that bad I think it's fine
[01:31:20] it's more about discipline than anything
[01:31:23] else I'm a
[01:31:28] [Music]
[01:31:36] procrastinator okay Jan ver stop okay
[01:31:40] actually I'm going to I have to stop

[01:32:11] mean I'm G to stop getting one
[01:32:16] guide no more getting one
[01:32:18] guide no more getting one guide
[01:32:25] per amember or fa codex for shenyun I
[01:32:27] know okay personal opinion I'm not a big
[01:32:29] fan of protype Ember I know Z Jeff likes
[01:32:31] it because it gives energy to your team
[01:32:32] it can help you stack finina faster and
[01:32:34] you don't need to build crit rate
[01:32:35] compared to fav personally I think
[01:32:37] building a bit of crit rate on five is
[01:32:38] not that big of a deal um
[01:32:42] however
[01:32:43] I I think both are fine depends up it's
[01:32:46] up to you I'm not a big fan of Amber on
[01:32:48] her but I acknowledge that objectively
[01:32:50] speaking it's not bad you get energy you
[01:32:52] heal your team it's fine I just don't
[01:32:53] like that you waste a bunch of HP so I
[01:32:55] actually prefer either ttds or an energy
[01:32:58] weapon if you have one um like fav or um
[01:33:03] why am I forgetting the other energy
[01:33:09] weapons I don't know oh this thing oh

[01:42:12] that a lot actually
[01:42:15] yeah I get that I get that a lot
[01:42:19] actually
[01:42:24] okay I've seen like six people me
[01:42:26] mentioned that they use eye of
[01:42:28] perception if you do cuz you want to
[01:42:30] that's cool but if you do because you
[01:42:32] think it's better than your other
[01:42:33] catalysts you can literally go to the
[01:42:35] blacksmith [ __ ] wagering binging and
[01:42:38] he'll make you a better one I'm not even
[01:42:40] kidding
[01:42:41] Claymore catalysts have literally some
[01:42:43] of the best freeto play options by far
[01:42:45] like four options in general you might
[01:42:46] get w at the word but even freet to play
[01:42:48] [ __ ] the new font 10 one [ __ ]
[01:42:50] black what is it called why did I say
[01:42:52] black not black lith what the [ __ ] is it

[01:42:55] it's
[01:42:56] called flowing Purity amazing [ __ ]
[01:42:59] mamare amazing [ __ ] I mean the some
[01:43:02] of the event ones are really good if you

[01:43:05] just the the crafted ones
[01:43:13] amazing I mean regarding black Cliff I
[01:43:16] like black Liff on a lot on some uh
[01:43:18] quite a few weapon types like sword and
[01:43:19] stuff but with regards to Catalyst I
[01:43:23] think it's just an objectively worse

[01:43:42] salesman how about ballad this okay
[01:43:44] that's Royal
[01:43:46] grimoire ballad has a lot of potential
[01:43:49] because there's a lot of stats here here
[01:43:51] it's just hard for a character to want
[01:43:52] normal attack damage charge attack
[01:43:54] damage and ER and attack scaling well
[01:43:57] the attack SC doesn't matter it's just
[01:43:58] base attack but yeah that's the main
[01:44:01] thing but um it's a lot of

[01:47:40] best
[01:47:41] time to change the stun lock to like
[01:47:44] back to like the good days where it was
[01:47:45] like oh hyper Bloom is

[01:48:33] true all purpose okay true actually true
[01:48:39] love yourself
[01:48:40] now the happy
[01:48:44] ending teamwork is
[01:48:47] D St Cloud confir I asked you this a
[01:48:50] year ago you don't know all a month wait
[01:48:52] a week ago you don't know what is it uh
[01:48:54] should I go for C6 bet or no C6 bet is I
[01:48:58] mean actually it's pretty good on
[01:48:59] aggravate teams if you also have another
[01:49:00] Electro or my first y okay first y c b
[01:49:04] are my first yaa for aggravate King
[01:49:05] first um
[01:49:08] first wait she's using the but I feel
[01:49:10] like I want to use Kar in wait do you
[01:49:11] have Kirara oh my God never mind this
[01:49:13] question has layers if you will fit Yao
[01:49:15] yaa into your team get ya yaa however if
[01:49:17] you already have Nikita and Kirara you
[01:49:19] usually could use Kirara instead if you
[01:49:21] need healer or Nita for an defensive
[01:49:22] option so you don't need the ya Yao so
[01:49:24] it it depends I would get a ya Yao
[01:49:27] because I I like it I think she's a good
[01:49:29] character and I want
[01:49:30] one
[01:49:33] however if you already have other
[01:49:36] options which you're saying you might
[01:49:38] then you could go for a constellation
[01:49:40] bet C2 is really broken C6 is nice
[01:49:45] especially if you're running another
[01:49:46] Electro character so if you're doing
[01:49:47] like beta official kaching beta well
[01:49:49] like y b or some [ __ ] um

[01:54:38] you could have said any other
[01:54:47] character is it better to burst with
[01:54:49] ging than skill I'm I still have to test
[01:54:51] as combos it's the last thing needing
[01:54:52] for the guide I've heard through the
[01:54:54] grape vine like okay the standard thing
[01:54:56] is e and then Q however I've heard uh
[01:55:00] that if you burst and then e and then
[01:55:02] your dog goes to you midair you can like
[01:55:06] effectively get an extra e by minimizing
[01:55:08] your downtime and then you e dog goes to
[01:55:10] midair or lion not dog and then you e
[01:55:13] again but I have to test it so it both
[01:55:16] are fine I have to see which one's
[01:55:17] better though I think for like standard
[01:55:20] gameplay you EQ but if you CU and then
[01:55:23] you like time it to where you're you e

[02:21:21] please please
[02:21:25] please
[02:21:27] no
[02:21:34] okay okay I told you to ask a question
[02:21:37] and not tell me to answer your question
[02:21:39] okay if I click on your name and your
[02:21:41] question is [ __ ] you will be banned for
[02:21:43] one day [ __ ] it two days actually
[02:21:48] seven
[02:21:51] years dude stop I don't feel like doing
[02:21:55] the math
[02:21:56] Midstream I don't you spam the same okay
[02:22:01] listen you can use an Optimizer there's
[02:22:03] gen optimiz you can go you plug in your
[02:22:05] artifacts it'll tell you which is better
[02:22:07] for crit value you can multiply them to
[02:22:09] see the answer crit rate times crit
[02:22:10] damage for em and HP it's a lot of the
[02:22:13] times it depends based on your sub stats
[02:22:15] okay if you tell me something like this
[02:22:16] I could probably give you a like 50 ADM
[02:22:19] is not enough so probably the other
[02:22:20] build although 25 KP is also low but 50
[02:22:22] ADM is not enough in fact uh the first
[02:22:25] 100 crit is more valuable than crit rate
[02:22:27] than crit in general uh 100 to 200 is
[02:22:29] good like even 200 is good so usually
[02:22:32] you want em so I want to go for a build
[02:22:33] that has 50 ADM however if you're going
[02:22:36] to like it I don't know what your crit
[02:22:37] rate is on each of them and like HP is
[02:22:40] also about so it depends okay typic I
[02:22:42] will say though you want more than 50
[02:22:44] ADM but you can use an optimizer um yeah
[02:22:48] double Hydro also helps with your HP and
[02:22:49] stuff and like you're not looking for
[02:22:51] like a specific amount of HP it's just
[02:22:54] HP is still nice so sometimes like
[02:22:58] substats matter but I will say probably
[02:23:00] em yes Pro like I'd rather have 250 em
[02:23:04] than [ __ ] 50 Em Right so probably em
[02:23:07] but use an Optimizer or go based on your
[02:23:10] sub
[02:23:12] stats I haven't touched this game in 3
[02:23:14] months but your Tweet brought me back no
[02:23:16] no no no no I no

[02:25:07] in a single Target situation which is
[02:25:09] his worst against probably his worst

[02:25:12] character is
[02:25:15] powerful

[02:29:54] okay okay no disrespect but the [ __ ]
[02:29:58] dude the the like platform support or
[02:30:00] like anything is so bad they still think
[02:30:03] my account is like a fan account so
[02:30:05] they're like flagging it for like
[02:30:07] unoriginal
[02:30:09] content it's so
[02:30:13] bad R till I can't know more horses in
[02:30:18] the
[02:30:23] back okay never mind wait what the [ __ ]
[02:30:25] she can just stand
[02:30:27] there okay with
[02:30:39] heels ISE it sh shun or wait for sh
[02:30:45] shons so sorry first time chatter I'm
[02:30:47] going to save you if you're a Shia main
[02:30:49] I'm genuinely going to save you the best
[02:30:51] Banner for Shia by far is this one it's
[02:30:54] not even Shia Banner this is Faron and
[02:30:58] Shan Yun versus whatever the [ __ ] is
[02:31:00] going to be on Shia's Banner do we know
[02:31:02] yeah we do there's like shenan oh my God
[02:31:04] jump scare warning well okay not sh
[02:31:05] Shan's fine she just sucks with Shia all
[02:31:07] the characters on the banner suck with
[02:31:08] Shia no disrespect to shenan the only
[02:31:10] jump scare in the game is Dory no
[02:31:12] disrespect Shan but you just she's not
[02:31:14] very good that's all no like you know
[02:31:17] it's not very
[02:31:19] good no slandering the character but you
[02:31:23] probably don't want to use the the the
[02:31:24] whole Shia Banner is a jump scare to
[02:31:27] Shia players because it's not good for
[02:31:29] Shia uh Shia Banner that is what I'm
[02:31:32] what you know what
[02:31:34] I
[02:31:35] [Music]
[02:31:40] um where the [ __ ] is it Shia Banner
[02:31:44] genin you can check it in game game yeah
[02:31:46] but isn't that like laggy I guess I
[02:31:49] should whatever
[02:31:52] fine right till I can't no more oh
[02:31:59] [ __ ] uh where is
[02:32:02] it no it's not here it's in the [ __ ]
[02:32:04] notices my
[02:32:10] bad
[02:32:15] here
[02:32:22] yeah I mean to be
[02:32:25] fair I want to be fair I want to
[02:32:27] backpedal on what I said ya Yao's good
[02:32:30] [ __ ] Wong and her cons can be good and
[02:32:32] like if you like shenan cool she's not
[02:32:34] great but you know that's fine but for
[02:32:36] Shia like Shia never gets characters
[02:32:38] that are good for him on his Banner like
[02:32:40] these are not characters you want to run
[02:32:41] with SH I love like Yaya's really
[02:32:44] good but you never get good Shia
[02:32:47] characters with Shia so if you're a Shia
[02:32:49] man and you ask me hey should I go for
[02:32:50] Shia cons Shia C1 is nice but it's not
[02:32:53] like great like it's fun it's nice at
[02:32:55] high investment I find it very valuable
[02:32:57] for me but it's a lot worse than like
[02:32:59] any other upgrade C2 sucks C3 sucks C4
[02:33:02] isn't real C5 is very minimal C6 is cool
[02:33:04] but it's C6 right shinette [ __ ]
[02:33:08] shenyun is broken well okay she's not
[02:33:10] broken but is really good with SH farzon
[02:33:14] C6 really good with sh even without C6
[02:33:17] pretty decent
[02:33:20] sh so I would recommend this for your sh
[02:33:23] more so than shaon or even like if you
[02:33:25] don't have Nita like go for Nita right
[02:33:28] yeah peace prevails throughout the land
[02:33:31] peace
[02:33:41] Prevail first message bro Shia is short
[02:33:47] um I don't even need to reply to that
[02:33:48] cuz like you already know the answer
[02:33:51] that's just
[02:33:56] bait okay yo where are you going where

[03:08:32] again oh God not
[03:08:42] again
[03:08:55] in
[03:08:58] life you have to believe in
[03:09:03] something you have to believe in
[03:09:08] yourself you have to love
[03:09:11] yourself before you can love others how
[03:09:14] do you expect anyone else to believe in
[03:09:16] you if you don't believe in yourself
[03:09:18] people ask me Z why do you like your own
[03:09:20] videos you upload a video it already has
[03:09:23] one
[03:09:23] like why do you laugh at your own
[03:09:27] jokes well the answer is simple if you
[03:09:30] don't like what you make what you do how
[03:09:33] do you expect others to like it if you
[03:09:35] don't find yourself funny how do you
[03:09:38] expect other people to find you
[03:09:40] funny you be like oh but I'm unlucky I'm
[03:09:42] not funny ah I just don't have it it's
[03:09:44] it's natural talent I can never learn
[03:09:47] this I'm not Michael Phelps I'm not
[03:09:50] [ __ ] William
[03:09:53] Shakespeare well let me tell you
[03:09:57] something it's not
[03:09:59] Talent it's dedication it's waking up
[03:10:03] and saying hey I'm great or [ __ ] it I'm
[03:10:05] not great but I will be I can be sorry
[03:10:10] for
[03:10:11] yelling and if you don't say that to
[03:10:15] yourself who
[03:10:17] will you think someone's going to knock
[03:10:19] on your door hey man you're doing great
[03:10:21] no if you don't care who
[03:10:24] will and sometimes it's better to
[03:10:28] believe in
[03:10:29] something than to believe in nothing at
[03:10:33] all because if you don't
[03:10:36] believe if you don't
[03:10:39] care and you think hey it'll never
[03:10:43] happen hey I'll never be
[03:10:46] great then maybe you never will but let
[03:10:50] me tell you
[03:10:53] something the moment you do
[03:10:56] believe and you say hey maybe it's time
[03:11:00] maybe I can do it yeah I fell down but I
[03:11:05] got back up and now I won't fall again
[03:11:08] maybe maybe I'll trip maybe I will fall
[03:11:11] but not the same way I'm a different man
[03:11:14] I learned I adapted yeah I make mistakes
[03:11:17] I make mistakes but I learn and I do
[03:11:22] better and you know what it does get
[03:11:25] better maybe I
[03:11:28] will achieve my
[03:11:31] dreams and roll the piece that I've been
[03:11:34] asking for yearning for I don't even
[03:11:37] know what that word means yearning for

[03:16:18] can type like concerned all you
[03:16:22] want but let me tell you something now
[03:16:25] that vermilion's in the strong box what
[03:16:27] separates the fake xaines the Vermilion
[03:16:30] strong boxers from the ones who really
[03:16:32] struggled like if I had to walk miles of
[03:16:37] broken glass to go to school every
[03:16:40] day and then they patched it and now you
[03:16:42] could take a bus to school
[03:16:46] right well there's nothing to to to show
[03:16:49] for my suffering but if now I have all
[03:16:53] of these perfect fourstar pieces that
[03:16:55] you can't actually get from the strong
[03:16:57] box it actually proves how much I farm
[03:17:00] the domain think about that think about
[03:17:02] that this is rarer than perfect five
[03:17:04] star pieces this is more
[03:17:07] rare
[03:17:11] true
[03:17:14] instructor trigger off field no so if
[03:17:16] it's on like ya ya you swap into her you
[03:17:18] Auto attack Quicken
[03:17:21] GG what separates them is that the
[03:17:24] people who strong box are sane unlike
[03:17:27] you you are implying that genin players
[03:17:30] are sane Checkmate atheist Yulie there's
[03:17:33] a juli chulie there's a two
[03:17:41] run
[03:17:43] if
[03:17:47] you what's up

[03:17:56] speaker thing you already are a

[04:15:22] I'm I'm so stupid I
[04:15:31] L how good of a pull is y Miko meta
[04:15:34] wise she's she's pretty good if you need
[04:15:37] a onfield her or can fit her in your
[04:15:39] deems she's
[04:15:41] good A lot of times she might not be
[04:15:43] needed because there's other electric
[04:15:45] characters who I will not name that
[04:15:46] could be good off field supports or
[04:15:48] onfield characters but Yi a lot of times
[04:15:51] can be a good option optimal in teams
[04:15:52] where you have a bit of downtime like
[04:15:54] tanari other times you can be used with
[04:15:56] other electric characters as like an
[04:15:57] onfield aggravator uh and stuff however
[04:16:01] uh in a lot of teams there's also some
[04:16:03] other Electro options you can use so not
[04:16:06] a needed character but a good
[04:16:08] one is she better than Fel I will not I
