[00:29:14] it sorry let's unb
[00:29:20] him wait [ __ ] I don't know how to Mo you
[00:29:24] got it or do I have to I just [ __ ] I
[00:29:26] typed the you in chat okay mods you got
[00:29:28] it just fine I finina review let's
[00:29:31] review this finina okay 35.7k
[00:29:34] HP weapon we got festering desire I
[00:29:37] respect it I respect it four golden
[00:29:40] troop best in slot
[00:29:42] c0o level eight talents which normally
[00:29:45] I'd be like if you love her crown her
[00:29:47] but the new boss just came out so I
[00:29:49] understand let's look at the artifacts
[00:29:51] golden troop that's pretty good good uh
[00:29:54] good good good good good good good
[00:29:58] what is
[00:30:01] this okay that's great that is a lot
[00:30:04] that is really good uh you also have an
[00:30:07] HP Roll Em which usually isn't the
[00:30:08] biggest deal but also I noticed you only
[00:30:10] have 19 Em which means that's your only
[00:30:12] em roll which means your rolles are
[00:30:13] insane but it's fine a lot of crit rate
[00:30:15] a lot of crit damage let's look at your
[00:30:18] Sands yo okay this is pretty cracked uh
[00:30:21] this is pretty insane and you're on an
[00:30:24] HP SS not ER because you're running an
[00:30:26] ER weapon so you can get away with it
[00:30:29] you only have two pieces left ghoul girl
[00:30:31] games in two months appreciate it Ts for
[00:30:33] the wonderful streams ZX you have two
[00:30:37] pieces left and if these pieces are the
[00:30:39] same quality as last ones this might be
[00:30:41] the best fro we've seen Sol six in two
[00:30:44] months okay two pieces left
[00:30:50] goblet
[00:30:55] ciret okay the goblets really good
[00:30:58] because you actually want ER right it's
[00:31:00] HP goblet which is uh sometimes even
[00:31:03] better than Hydro they're about the same
[00:31:04] for frea HP can be a little bit better
[00:31:07] ER really good crit rate crit damage
[00:31:09] good this ciret is very okay okay I'm
[00:31:13] sorry if you show me a beautiful
[00:31:16] five-star dish and the ciret is like a
[00:31:17] three star appetizer it's still okay
[00:31:20] it's not bad but everything else is
[00:31:22] pretty insane even the Goblet it looks
[00:31:23] funny but it's actually not bad cuz you
[00:31:25] need ER on finina I don't know how much
[00:31:26] you have but it looks like you need ER
[00:31:28] so that plus these other insane pieces
[00:31:29] is a good for youo yeah good for
[00:31:35] youo HP is better for Golden troop okay
[00:31:38] why are you guys typing like I don't
[00:31:40] know it's one to two substats difference
[00:31:44] I hate this people will take an HP
[00:31:46] goblet being like Oh it's actually not
[00:31:47] even two I'm pretty sure it's just one
[00:31:49] people take an HP goblet being one
[00:31:50] substat better and will say every oh you
[00:31:52] have to run HP you have to run HP you
[00:31:53] have to run dude it's like as good it
[00:31:55] just go whichever you have HP is easier
[00:31:57] to get HP is easier to get less people
[00:31:59] use HP it's easier to farm for HP Goblin
[00:32:01] than Hydro but with golden troop HP is
[00:32:03] like one to two to 3% better it's like
[00:32:06] barely anything which means go whichever
[00:32:09] one you have the thing is when before I
[00:32:12] looked into finina the the word of mouth
[00:32:14] was you need to go HP goblet so I was
[00:32:16] like okay I have to go HP goblet then I
[00:32:17] looked into it I'm like wait a second
[00:32:18] it's the [ __ ] it's basically the same
[00:32:20] as Hydro slightly better so it just
[00:32:22] depends on you have cuz me personally I
[00:32:24] have a really good Hydro goblet but my
[00:32:26] HP goblet sucks
[00:32:30] penis anyways they're both really good
[00:32:32] by the
[00:32:34] way HP is slightly better though which I
[00:32:37] want to say is a is is more important
[00:32:40] than you might think because it's easier
[00:32:43] to get HP goblets unless people use HP
[00:32:44] goblets and it's just you know more
[00:32:47] diversa
[00:32:49] ility yeah it also depends on your team
[00:32:51] that's true it but golden troop gives
[00:32:53] you a lot of damage percent so that's
[00:32:55] usually why that plus her burst uh
[00:32:57] someone didn't run an ad but I can't in
[00:32:58] the first hour of my stream so you just
[00:33:00] minus 35k points but I'll remember it
[00:33:02] when chat misbehaves in an hour or two
[00:33:05] uh with that in mind let's look at this
[00:33:06] ratio 72 72 200 er a lot of HP too
[00:33:11] pretty tasty was a good
[00:33:13] finina it's a good
[00:33:16] finina this is a actually a cracked
[00:33:19] finina let's roll the dice again if we
[00:33:21] get another six you're banned
[00:33:25] again
[00:33:29] [ __ ] oh yeah yeah yeah wait wait yeah
[00:33:32] yeah also I forgot for this ratio you
[00:33:34] have 72 72 but you also get 12 crit rate
[00:33:36] with festering that's true yeah 12 crit
[00:33:38] rate with festering still good though 84
[00:33:41] to 172 is like basically one to two cuz
[00:33:44] yeah it's it's very close to one to two
[00:33:46] so it's actually really nice with enough
[00:33:48] ER and a lot of HP nice good for
[00:33:55] now
[00:33:57] [Applause]
[00:34:01] does he usually talk this
[00:34:07] much
[00:34:14] no than a [ __ ] 50 uh 5K bits though
[00:34:18] that's insane appreciate it [ __ ] it

[00:44:38] genin there's probably like one more
[00:44:41] incident but I don't remember but I
[00:44:43] think at least top two was playing
[00:44:46] wander with CZ farz on and no Shield
[00:44:48] testing him like like right before uh
[00:44:51] the guy dropped cuz the also the abyss
[00:44:54] was [ __ ] ass it was not fun I I
[00:44:57] genuinely was like maling while
[00:44:59] recording off like like just like doing
[00:45:01] clears it was so
[00:45:04] bad it wasn't like it's not like he was
[00:45:06] bad which that's okay that's what was
[00:45:08] more annoying it wasn't even that it was
[00:45:10] bad it was that it was like well Faron
[00:45:13] needed 6 million ER and I had no Shield
[00:45:15] so I got hit by all the [ __ ] [ __ ]
[00:45:17] in the abyss and like the damage was
[00:45:19] there but if I mess up once and I can't
[00:45:21] use it in the video cuz it looks bad
[00:45:22] anyways I teleported back for the
[00:45:23] crystal F
[00:45:24] trap
[00:45:27] maybe it's a sign maybe it's like the

[00:51:02] intricate details of a lot of the new
[00:51:04] five star weapons
[00:51:07] okay now this isn't in Rel this is more
[00:51:10] in relation to me being like okay this
[00:51:13] isn't first of all this isn't in
[00:51:14] relation to the people yesterday being
[00:51:16] like Oh staff of scarlet sand is so good
[00:51:19] no listen okay listen first of all I
[00:51:21] have to say this if you're pulling for a
[00:51:23] five star spear get one that your whole
[00:51:24] [ __ ] your whole cast can use okay get
[00:51:27] H okay Scarlet sense sure it could be
[00:51:30] great on triang Ling but a lot of our
[00:51:31] teams you need like a million ER and you
[00:51:32] could just go catch or fa anyways but
[00:51:34] you know or engulfing but you know
[00:51:35] Scarlet's still good but and yeah it's
[00:51:38] it's close to H for Hut I know but still
[00:51:42] I'd rather have a home on my account
[00:51:43] that's all I'm saying anyways I've
[00:51:45] noticed that a few of the weapons that
[00:51:46] are like very similar I kind of don't
[00:51:48] remember what the [ __ ] the differences
[00:51:50] are so we are we're going to have to
[00:51:52] we're going to have to go through them
[00:51:53] together chat okay like I can tell you
[00:51:55] that splitter has high base attack and
[00:51:56] 44 crit damage and I can tell you that
[00:51:58] [ __ ] the the lowf has 88 crit damage
[00:52:00] and a lower base attack like five
[00:52:02] something 42 80 I don't know something
[00:52:03] like that right lower base deck I I know
[00:52:06] the stats but I don't know what the [ __ ]
[00:52:08] they proc and it [ __ ] with me because
[00:52:10] it makes me feel like I need to know
[00:52:11] more than I know
[00:52:17] so let's go through a couple five star
[00:52:19] weapons together uh so normally I would
[00:52:22] use so I opened two websites uh genin a
[00:52:25] a c w normally I would use project Ember
[00:52:27] but they're showing random ass weapons
[00:52:29] so this isn't leaks we I turned like
[00:52:31] unreleased content off cuz we don't talk
[00:52:33] about leaks but there's a [ __ ]
[00:52:34] primordial great swword so I don't know
[00:52:36] what the [ __ ] that is but anyways let's
[00:52:38] just ignore so listen I don't know what
[00:52:40] the listen I don't know why that's there
[00:52:41] listen I don't okay I don't I don't know
[00:52:45] why that's there okay that's all I'm
[00:52:47] saying but this website is kind of a KW
[00:52:49] so I don't know which one to
[00:52:54] use
[00:52:57] that's a 1.0 Weapon It's been there
[00:52:59] since
[00:53:00] launch
[00:53:08] really sure
[00:53:13] buddy anyways um so I have to go through
[00:53:17] a few five stars just to refresh my
[00:53:20] memory okay um just to refresh my memory
[00:53:24] I I so I pulled this up too just so I
[00:53:27] could like organize the ones that I know
[00:53:28] and the ones that I know less about and
[00:53:30] instead of making it like a tier list CU
[00:53:31] I want people to think this a tier list
[00:53:33] I Nam them all aboba just so you guys
[00:53:34] don't think this is like sa A B C D um
[00:53:39] yeah I mean obviously this is this is
[00:53:41] the aboba tier so this one okay this one
[00:53:44] the good one will call aboba the bad one
[00:53:45] will call aboba backwards which should
[00:53:47] be a b o b a aboba so yeah uh this is
[00:53:52] obviously a
[00:53:54] boba
[00:53:55] anyways let's see the ones that I wait
[00:53:57] which okay wait which weapons do I
[00:53:58] actually need to know more about okay

[01:00:36] already saw what
[01:00:45] else uh let's open Calamity I know what
[01:00:49] calamity does but let's reread
[01:00:52] it uh I'm actually going to rad Mo glow
[01:00:56] and this and that and this and that and
[01:00:59] this and this and that actually [ __ ] all
[01:01:02] of them,
[01:01:05] [Music]
[01:01:07] 4,160 okay let me write it down okay but
[01:01:11] okay actually stopped with the frea
[01:01:13] reviews though also your uid is too long
[01:01:15] you put an extra number I think you put
[01:01:17] three ones instead of
[01:01:19] two anyways okay CL color High [ __ ]
[01:01:23] base stack and then you get El damage
[01:01:25] bonus and attack whoa pogers okay no one
[01:01:28] cares Everlasting moon glow healing
[01:01:30] bonus normal attack damage by your HP
[01:01:32] and your no attack restores energy so
[01:01:34] very cool for literally no one uh but
[01:01:36] you can use on kakomi so that's cool 50%
[01:01:41] HP
[01:01:42] um how this on my sha Calamity is not
[01:01:45] bad for sha really high base attack it's
[01:01:46] actually especially if you're running
[01:01:48] Mar Hunter it's good it's good with
[01:01:52] finina M what Moonglow I
[01:02:01] mean I mean like yeah you can unfield
[01:02:03] your kakomi with finina I mean
[01:02:05] true but
[01:02:11] um
[01:02:14] yeah anyways kagura's
[01:02:18] Varity this one we have three copies of
[01:02:21] when using a skill causes the elemental
[01:02:23] skill that of the character wielding
[01:02:25] weapon to increase by 12% for a lot of
[01:02:27] characters that's all you
[01:02:30] get but it can stack three
[01:02:35] times and then it will also gain another
[01:02:37] 12% when you fully stack it so a lot of
[01:02:39] characters can't fully stack it but some
[01:02:40] can and for the others it's just
[01:02:42] basically a Haron right but like crit
[01:02:45] damage instead of crit rate cuz Haron
[01:02:46] also gives you 12% but then Haron gives
[01:02:48] you normal attack
[01:02:50] damage oh Gage thousand floating dreams
[01:02:53] this shit's weird uh by the way the way
[01:02:54] if you flip this weapon if you flip this
[01:02:56] weapon if you flip this
[01:02:59] weapon if you flip this weapon it is an
[01:03:03] arara fun fact this is an arinara
[01:03:07] this is an
[01:03:08] arara there you
[01:03:11] go anyways 265 em not bad could be good
[01:03:16] on melting onfield like a uh like like
[01:03:19] let's say you're melting on rizzly
[01:03:20] actually not bad but it's mostly an aita
[01:03:22] weapon um it's actually not it's it's
[01:03:25] all it's actually not bad uh you also
[01:03:27] get stats based on your party memb types
[01:03:29] it's Elemental Mastery if they're not
[01:03:31] the same
[01:03:34] type wait wa Let Me Rad
[01:03:37] this not if types are the same you get
[01:03:39] em if they're not the same you get
[01:03:41] damage bonus from their Elemental
[01:03:47] type cool so if you're the same type you
[01:03:51] get em if you're not the same type you
[01:03:53] get elemental damage
[01:03:55] and then your party members also get
[01:03:59] DM bogers that could actually be a [ __ ]
[01:04:02] ton of stats though okay T
[01:04:06] Taya normal attack speed good base
[01:04:09] attack 44 crit damage this is like uh
[01:04:12] this is like Miss spitter when the
[01:04:14] wielder unleashes the skill no attack
[01:04:15] damage will be increased no ATT attack
[01:04:18] no attack will be
[01:04:20] increased uh and then you get more you
[01:04:22] can get up to 48% which is this is
[01:04:24] actually good for rizzly by the way very
[01:04:26] good rizzly option too other than just
[01:04:28] wander cash flow we know what this does
[01:04:31] uh but it also it's when your HP
[01:04:33] increases or decreases and with finina
[01:04:34] you can use this on basically anyone cuz
[01:04:36] you get attack which is good and you
[01:04:38] also get normal and charge attack damage
[01:04:40] which is good on a lot of you know
[01:04:42] onfield catalysts not everyone but you
[01:04:44] know maybe you're like could be good for
[01:04:46] the wander to to of the Eternal flow
[01:04:49] great Polar Star we know what this does
[01:04:53] but I want to reread this stack
[01:04:54] conditions I know you need to charge
[01:04:55] shot yeah normal charge skill or burst
[01:04:58] and then you get 12% damage for skill
[01:05:01] burst and you also get a bunch of attack
[01:05:04] that's POG Aqua [ __ ] you Aqua sorry
[01:05:07] aqua's

[01:23:49] go whoa we got it
[01:23:54] did inuma just come out yeah I mean I've
[01:23:57] been exploring it since it came out but
[01:23:58] you know it is brand new this in five
[01:24:01] months okay we got our chest let's go
[01:24:07] out Noe we're not clicking on that
[01:24:10] again is it time for
[01:24:14] resin oh let me show you what I cooked
[01:24:17] then we're going to resin for the rest
[01:24:18] of the stream let me show you what I
[01:24:19] cooked let me show you dude my throat
[01:24:20] literally hurts what the [ __ ] did I do
[01:24:21] in the first hour of
[01:24:25] streaming do you guys want to see what I
[01:24:27] cooked do you guys want to see what I
[01:24:29] cooked so I we talked about this team
[01:24:31] already but let me show you what the
[01:24:34] [ __ ] I did let me show you what I did to
[01:24:36] benett okay let me show you he For the
[01:24:39] First Time For The First Time in
[01:24:43] Forever was went off Aquilla he's on
[01:24:47] Skyward
[01:24:50] blade and I took him off no bless for
[01:24:54] two vasha two listen don't try this at
[01:24:57] home kids I'm a licensed
[01:25:00] professional
[01:25:02] but I listen I don't have maidens
[01:25:07] obviously but I have two Vash 200 CL
[01:25:10] look at this 20 hp look at this 20 hp
[01:25:13] look at this 46 HP 10 er a million flat
[01:25:17] look at this HP ER look at this healing
[01:25:19] bonus 20 ER sheesh why why do you need
[01:25:23] healing on Bennett Ox why do you need
[01:25:25] healing on Bennett o because T level 13
[01:25:28] we have some healing that scales on your
[01:25:30] burst Bennett can't heal above 7% fee
[01:25:32] that's kind of weird but that's kind of
[01:25:34] weird
[01:25:36] but if he can full heal we what we want
[01:25:39] is we want our character to go from
[01:25:41] under 70 to over 100 not just 100 you
[01:25:44] have to overheal why because benett only
[01:25:47] heals one character at a time so
[01:25:49] generally you're not enough of a Healer
[01:25:51] for a f team but if in one tick you can
[01:25:54] fully heal your characters then anyone
[01:25:56] you quick swap to will not only get
[01:25:59] healed but will also trigger Fess
[01:26:01] passive the see nope unheard nope
[01:26:04] endless Walts which will heal everyone
[01:26:06] in your party based on her Max HP for
[01:26:09] the Overflow healing once every two
[01:26:11] seconds now because you can you can
[01:26:13] quick swap between characters or if
[01:26:15] you're playing a character who says
[01:26:16] lament and then is on field for like 15
[01:26:18] seconds well you can't really swap out
[01:26:20] but if you can over heal your team
[01:26:23] through Bennett by Perma full healing
[01:26:26] you then you know maybe finina can
[01:26:30] actually work with only Bennett and so I
[01:26:32] was cooking a little I was cooking a
[01:26:34] little plan our next
[01:26:36] move I was cooking a
[01:26:40] little we already watch the Jeff bedge
[01:26:43] okay listen the BET part not my
[01:26:46] idea people were talking about in chat
[01:26:48] so I checked was Adge
[01:26:50] true however
[01:26:53] I really wholeheartedly believe that
[01:26:56] solo healer Bennett with finina is
[01:26:59] either a quick swap team or is extremely
[01:27:02] cope
[01:27:03] okay I think it's very unrealistic and
[01:27:06] Niche unless you're quick
[01:27:08] swapping but do you know who drains his
[01:27:12] own
[01:27:13] HP those demons shout which is why I
[01:27:17] care if it was just a random ass team
[01:27:19] where it's like oh you can B it I mean
[01:27:20] okay I'll I'll put him on my other team
[01:27:22] F also skills with Max HP so a lot of
[01:27:24] teams like if you're doing like this
[01:27:25] with you know you don't really want you
[01:27:27] don't need a [ __ ] benit you could
[01:27:28] just go kakomi
[01:27:30] but if you're playing
[01:27:32] Shia and so here's what a Shia team
[01:27:34] looks like you have Shia if you have far
[01:27:36] on you far on you can sucros but Shia
[01:27:38] farzon and Bennett and then some random
[01:27:41] dumbass so if you're bad skill issue
[01:27:44] haha XD usually us Jong Le he can go
[01:27:46] milth red tread that's good but C6
[01:27:50] farzon has milth so he's redundant here
[01:27:52] and a lot of times you can go Toma if
[01:27:54] you have him C6 pun damage pyro bonus
[01:27:56] but it's also Toma it's a shield but
[01:27:57] like who gives a [ __ ]
[01:27:59] right if you don't have C6 fars on sorry
[01:28:02] you would run another anemo just to like
[01:28:04] you know get some [ __ ] energy CU you
[01:28:06] don't have C6 fars on uh you could just
[01:28:08] do that if you do have C6 bars on I
[01:28:09] actually really like crit cazo here by
[01:28:11] the way I think it's good but for most
[01:28:12] people the last s here is just a random
[01:28:14] idiot okay random character
[01:28:17] but if you have finina what if I could
[01:28:20] give my sh up to 75 % damage
[01:28:24] bonus is my slapping forena in there on
[01:28:27] top of good damage and either milth on
[01:28:29] farzon to buff your sh or veres venor to
[01:28:31] swirl buff your
[01:28:34] finina not a bad
[01:28:36] idea you actually have a pretty good
[01:28:38] team and this team actually mathed out
[01:28:40] to be better than the Jong Lee here
[01:28:42] apparently I could be wrong it's not my
[01:28:44] math sh's math go check them out Mark
[01:28:47] discord.
[01:28:47] g/ I mean I I like cooked the team up
[01:28:51] without knowing it was a team and then
[01:28:52] when I checked they were like yeah we
[01:28:53] mathed it I was like oh but anys okay
[01:28:55] anyways so you could do this listen now
[01:28:57] if you now Jean lowkey could be better
[01:28:58] than than Bennett okay on average go
[01:29:00] Jean more consistent usually better if
[01:29:04] you have C4 Jean basically just always
[01:29:06] better cuz you reduce res red you can go
[01:29:08] Freedom sworn I fight for Freedom sorry
[01:29:11] and it's cool but I don't have C4 Gene
[01:29:14] shut up I don't I actually don't she czo
[01:29:17] don't talk to me don't talk to me don't
[01:29:19] talk to me anyways so you know we can
[01:29:22] actually boken the boken and
[01:29:25] Faron now my only
[01:29:28] dilmus my only dilemma here is I'm
[01:29:31] actually not
[01:29:33] sure if I farzon burst or Bennett burst
[01:29:37] like the order so normally you farzon
[01:29:39] before Bennett because the up time and
[01:29:40] you don't want to [ __ ] Bennett's burst
[01:29:42] you don't want to waste
[01:29:43] time
[01:29:45] but what I think is important to
[01:29:48] understand is also sometimes your hp's
[01:29:50] [ __ ] and you want your Stacks to ramp
[01:29:51] up fast and I think lowkey because
[01:29:54] faron's burst is a four star so there's
[01:29:55] no animations so it only takes like 1
[01:29:57] second so you don't really lose much B
[01:29:58] at up time it might be more efficient to
[01:29:59] benit burst swaps your low HP Faron if
[01:30:02] she's low HP burst throughout the burst
[01:30:03] animation you get healed one tick to
[01:30:05] full HP then you swap the Sha then you
[01:30:07] start with more finina Stacks because
[01:30:08] you finina bursted so I'm not sure what
[01:30:10] ORD is better but look let me show you
[01:30:12] how I cooked with this team let me show
[01:30:13] you how I cooked with this team I
[01:30:14] literally cooked you a four- star five
[01:30:15] star six-star meal let me show
[01:30:20] you
[01:30:24] is my sh on Jade he better be on Jade
[01:30:26] also if you're okay this is not even a
[01:30:28] yoke you want your character to be as
[01:30:30] low HP as possible outside of finina and
[01:30:32] Bennett so your Fin's overflow healing
[01:30:35] overflows more
[01:30:38] percentage watch
[01:30:45] this time to BR my horizons
[01:30:49] again disaar
[01:31:01] okay that wasn't fully stacked but we
[01:31:03] don't we don't you know is what it is
[01:31:05] now watch this watch this watch this
[01:31:06] watch this uh what order do I want to do
[01:31:08] oh my God I wasn't looking oh I wasted
[01:31:11] all time it's fine now we're looking now
[01:31:13] we're looking yeah I think here actually
[01:31:15] went farz on I should what benett first
[01:31:16] Den Faron I think no what am I doing
[01:31:18] anyways look look let me cook let me
[01:31:19] cook it's actually bonus if we take
[01:31:22] damage here like I lowy want to take
[01:31:23] damage yep
[01:31:29] good see we full capped I mean it's near
[01:31:32] the end of the rotation though I wish we
[01:31:33] could do it faster maybe we could maybe
[01:31:34] I could have played that better maybe I
[01:31:35] could have healed far better I probably
[01:31:37] should healed Faron it's fine let me
[01:31:39] show you the second half second half
[01:31:42] will be better terrible stacking okay I
[01:31:45] [ __ ] up because we should have B it
[01:31:48] into farzon but we still got probably
[01:31:53] half stacks the whole time half of 75%
[01:31:55] damage is not bad also you could have C2
[01:31:58] far on but half like the damage us is
[01:32:00] like oage and she does personal damage
[01:32:04] anyways I could have done better though
[01:32:06] Temple of
[01:32:07] Wis here comes the
[01:32:10] C it's not like you're missing much dude
[01:32:13] the the last slot there would be a
[01:32:14] shield usually wow oh my God I need a
[01:32:16] shield on a character that can punch six
[01:32:18] [ __ ] years in midair bro if like

[01:32:31] Miss they miss him they miss him they
[01:32:33] don't hit him it's different cuz he goes

[01:36:06] this again let's do it here and we'll do

[01:36:34] dude okay going farz on first literally
[01:36:36] only loses
[01:36:38] like it loses some time but it's like
[01:36:41] 1.5
[01:36:46] seconds do I think it's optimal probably
[01:36:49] not maybe I'm not sure but it definitely
[01:36:52] helps get you
[01:36:56] Stacks the process of
[01:36:58] elimination I sure you alarm bursted why

[01:54:51] when I return from my second PE of the
[01:54:54] day I've been drinking so much water uh
[01:54:57] we're actually going to play this team
[01:54:59] though so let me
[01:55:03] beb close your tabs this is nothing I
[01:55:05] usually have this but on like eight
[01:55:07] different Google chromes I actually
[01:55:08] remember what each tab is watch Miss
[01:55:12] spitter is
[01:55:18] here
[01:55:21] true he's actually just different this
[01:55:24] is an aboba tier list aboba was not
[01:55:26] actually a list I was just
[01:55:28] yeah catch is there
[01:55:41] though anyways I have to pee uh what do
[01:55:44] you guys what can you guys watch while I
[01:55:46] uh uh [ __ ]
[01:55:50] uh
[01:55:51] [ __ ]
[01:55:59] um wait do you guys want to watch my
[01:56:00] mixtape is ited already dude Mariah
[01:56:03] edited my my [ __ ] finina like guide
[01:56:06] clip into a mixtape I didn't even ask
[01:56:08] him to do this he just randomly did it
[01:56:11] [ __ ] gigachad look listen listen
[01:56:13] listen listen I'm actually I'm actually
[01:56:15] going to stay here for
[01:56:17] this you're probably watching this cuz
[01:56:19] you asked if finina is better than Singo
[01:56:20] or yolan you're one of those Chatters
[01:56:22] okay no it's okay I still respect you
[01:56:24] here's the answer yes and no okay Fin's
[01:56:26] buff and personal damage is so [ __ ]
[01:56:28] insane that anytime you can run her run
[01:56:30] however she needs a Healer that can full
[01:56:31] heal all of your team at the same time
[01:56:33] which means a lot of times you have to
[01:56:34] remove a good offensive option like Kazo
[01:56:36] for a defensive one like Jean or Nikita
[01:56:38] for baiju for example it's still not bad
[01:56:39] but it's something you have to consider
[01:56:40] with that in mind if you can run for un
[01:56:42] team you usually want to and you can run
[01:56:43] double Hydro kind of like s and yolan
[01:56:45] you can run yolan or SRO and finina now
[01:56:46] how does she compare with others well
[01:56:48] her Hydro application is a bit slower so
[01:56:50] she doesn't really want to be the solo
[01:56:51] Hydro for someone like Kar du but she
[01:56:53] can for my testing
[01:56:54] Foria or de barely right which is not
[01:56:57] bad but I usually recommend using your
[01:56:59] double Hydro teams like that and in
[01:57:00] situations like that you lost personal
[01:57:02] like percentage motion value damage yeah
[01:57:04] here it should have been motion value
[01:57:05] not most by the way if you're watching
[01:57:07] but it is what it
[01:57:09] is more person Dage because her buff
[01:57:12] Buffs all of your party including
[01:57:13] herself which means with her Buffs she
[01:57:15] can actually do more and yon's buff is
[01:57:17] only to the a wait wait dude since I
[01:57:20] okay this is a fact since I dropped this
[01:57:23] album since I dropped this this since I
[01:57:25] dropped this mixtape Eminem said I'm
[01:57:28] retiring and joined fortnite that's true
[01:57:30] Eminem literally joined fortnite cuz he
[01:57:32] couldn't compete however cro gives you
[01:57:35] defens actually true by the way True by
[01:57:37] the way so there's situations where you
[01:57:39] want to use them more than free enough
[01:57:40] for example you only want one Hydro
[01:57:41] character or you need a Healer like you
[01:57:42] can't fit a Healer like genor team and
[01:57:44] Kazo gives you grouping so do you want
[01:57:45] to replace Kazo with je as you want to
[01:57:46] as you don't so it's pretty Nuance but
[01:57:48] for well Balan but also broken I'm okay
[01:57:51] I'm fine quing Chana quing
[01:57:53] [Music]
[01:57:55] CH I'm getting you're getting
[01:58:01] paid I'm paying
[01:58:04] him who is this
[01:58:06] guy
[01:58:08] okay okay all right
[01:58:12] well hey the the more views the the more
[01:58:15] Mariah gets paid so go watch the video
[01:58:18] this is our second channel to
[01:58:19] wow go check it out I linked it in
[01:58:26] the okay I'm going to let this video
[01:58:28] play while I pee okay
[01:58:30] it I'm I'm just going to skip to a
[01:58:32] random part okay let me
[01:58:34] be and then it's like we Vaped 100K but
[01:58:37] it's like that was such a [ __ ] rotation
[01:58:39] cuz the let me not show you guys Abyss
[01:58:41] content when do I get out of the
[01:58:46] Abyss okay it's it's show
[01:58:50] time she like how do I how do I describe
[01:58:52] fre I think she lives life on caps lock
[01:58:55] it's not just about length it's also
[01:58:57] about quality motion of the ocean
[01:59:07] [Music]
[01:59:10] what I was listen I was playing listen
[01:59:14] bro oh I can actually damage it here
[01:59:18] okay
[01:59:22] whoa 40K Vape duuke does what Mark he's
[01:59:26] going to eat us what if I eye frame
[01:59:30] it where the [ __ ] did I
[01:59:37] okay why is my why is my Yan doing more
[01:59:41] than my duuke question
[01:59:48] mark
[01:59:50] okay my fre is level two
[01:59:53] dude I okay the delute guide is getting
[01:59:56] delayed by another
[01:59:58] month
[02:00:00] Grand Grandmaster Jean I I'm I'm ma a
[02:00:05] cartographer from the Knights of
[02:00:08] favonius you're probably watching this
[02:00:10] cuz you asked if finina is better than S
[02:00:12] you're one of those Chatters okay no
[02:00:13] it's okay I still respect you here's the
[02:00:15] answer yes and no okay fina's buff and
[02:00:18] personal damage is so [ __ ] insane
[02:00:20] that anytime you can run her you run her
[02:00:21] however she needs a Healer that can full
[02:00:23] heal all of your team at the same time
[02:00:24] which means a lot of times you have to
[02:00:25] remove a good offensive option like Kazo
[02:00:27] for a defensive one like Jean or Nikita
[02:00:29] for baiju for example it's still not bad
[02:00:30] but it's something you have to consider
[02:00:32] with that in mind if you can run forun
[02:00:33] team you usually want to and you can run
[02:00:34] double Hydro kind of like cro and yolan
[02:00:36] you can run yolan or cro and finina now
[02:00:38] how does she compare with others well
[02:00:39] her Hydro application is a bit slower so
[02:00:41] she doesn't really want to be the solo
[02:00:42] Hydro for someone like Kut duuke but she
[02:00:44] can from my testing for the most part
[02:00:45] keep up with someone like Yia or DEA
[02:00:47] barely right which is not bad but I
[02:00:49] usually recommend using your double
[02:00:50] Hydra in teams like that and in
[02:00:52] situations like that y's personal like
[02:00:54] percentage motion value damage is higher
[02:00:55] than Finas but fora can actually have
[02:00:57] more personal damage because her buff
[02:00:59] Buffs all of your party including
[02:01:00] herself which means with her Buffs she
[02:01:02] can actually do more and Y L's buff is
[02:01:04] only to the active character however
[02:01:06] snal gives you defensive utility and
[02:01:08] healing on so there's situations where
[02:01:11] you want to use them more than free
[02:01:11] enough for example you only want one
[02:01:12] Hydro character or you need a Healer
[02:01:14] like you can't fit a Healer like genor
[02:01:15] team and Kazo gives you grouping so do
[02:01:17] you want to you want do you don't
[02:01:19] scatter Bal but also broken I'm okay I'm
[02:01:23] fine I
[02:01:26] SC I'll throw at you oh
[02:01:33] [ __ ] I I got a I don't want to I wanted
[02:01:36] a bit of caffeine but not a full
[02:01:38] coffee's

[02:02:50] a lot of people don't like it but I
[02:02:51] think you just have a baby palette all
[02:02:53] good I know that it tastes like medicine
[02:02:54] that you traumatized about cuz I also
[02:02:56] have to have [ __ ] disgusting Cherry

[02:04:15] the I will say we'll probably play Zess
[02:04:18] again later I will
[02:04:20] say I like the combat a lot I just think
[02:04:25] period however I think a lot of the
[02:04:27] dialogue and like marketing and design
[02:04:29] is a little too cummer for me that
[02:04:31] doesn't mean I don't like I still enjoy
[02:04:33] the gameplay but it's a little too
[02:04:35] cummer for me it's like I'm not going to
[02:04:37] imitate it but it's like a little too
[02:04:44] cummer Soul Hound's lit
[02:04:47] though
[02:04:50] lore Skipper respon it doesn't matter
[02:04:52] about the lore if every time the [ __ ]
[02:04:54] catg girl comes out streight she's like
[02:04:56] yeah I don't care okay I'm not going to
[02:04:58] read the lore if that's what she sounds
[02:05:00] like I I can't I can't play it around my
[02:05:02] family I can't play it around my my my I
[02:05:04] can't tell Hey Brother come play this
[02:05:06] game if my friends if my college friends
[02:05:09] God forbid they find my stream if they
[02:05:11] one day they're like hey man what have
[02:05:12] you been playing and I show them a game
[02:05:14] where every character has their [ __ ]
[02:05:16] has their [ __ ] Bonkers leaking out of
[02:05:19] their shirt and they're [ __ ] moaning
[02:05:20] when you play them I'm sorry maybe I
[02:05:23] don't want to tell them I play that
[02:05:24] maybe hey I I play uh I play League of
[02:05:29] Legends I see the value in my but I I
[02:05:31] like the combat I think it's fun it's
[02:05:32] just a little cumer a little bit a
[02:05:35] little bit league is worse it is league
[02:05:38] is wor to take pride in fulfilling my
[02:05:40] duties I actually don't know what is a
[02:05:41] what's a normal person game I play
[02:05:44] Animal
[02:05:47] Crossing
[02:05:50] CS okay no CS is not normal I I can
[02:05:56] count half the Cs
[02:06:00] games literally 60% of Cs lobbies I've
[02:06:04] been in have said they've I've heard at
[02:06:06] least two different
[02:06:17] slurs
[02:06:19] you actually can't name a normal game
[02:06:21] except maybe Animal
[02:06:24] Crossing I guess like Souls games are
[02:06:26] like pretty
[02:06:28] normal OverWatch nah that [ __ ] is no
[02:06:31] that is not
[02:06:33] normal I guess they I guess I could be
[02:06:37] like oh I started playing League cuz
[02:06:39] they new jeans
[02:06:42] collab slurp per minute league is way
[02:06:45] higher the thing okay I actually agree
[02:06:48] because League players can type you
[02:06:49] don't have to talk it's a lot different
[02:06:52] like typing is like you're like being a
[02:06:54] coward that's why I think like okay
[02:06:57] that's why I think this dude that's why
[02:06:59] I think league is like the most toxic
[02:07:01] toxic per capita cuz you can hide behind
[02:07:02] a [ __ ] keyboard like valerin and like
[02:07:06] so voice comom games are more like
[02:07:08] sexist cuz they'll be like oh and then
[02:07:09] they'll just be a sexist if you like
[02:07:11] don't sound [ __ ] masculine which fair
[02:07:14] but oh not fair that's bad but I'm
[02:07:15] saying like outside of That League
[02:07:17] people just like [ __ ]
[02:07:19] spam everything in the whole [ __ ] the
[02:07:22] the the
[02:07:25] dictionary Fair okay not fair as in
[02:07:27] that's good obviously that's [ __ ]
[02:07:28] terrible and weird and I get it okay I'm
[02:07:31] just saying like Okay let me let me
[02:07:34] rephrase that's bad which makes it worse
[02:07:38] cuz some people don't want to come which
[02:07:39] is annoying which is why like you know
[02:07:41] it's cringe
[02:07:43] but league is like they have that but
[02:07:47] because there's no coms it's like in
[02:07:50] text and because it's in text people are
[02:07:52] more vile cuz you like aren't as a like
[02:07:55] if you're typing it's like a lot easier
[02:07:58] to just be an [ __ ] than if you're
[02:08:02] talking Fair okay listen I I didn't say
[02:08:05] fair I mean I did but I didn't say fair
[02:08:07] like that I meant like that is a true
[02:08:10] point I didn't turn into the crystals oh
[02:08:13] [ __ ]
[02:08:17] oops
[02:08:25] what is a uh oh is a it's a
[02:08:46] cat early when you're typing yeah well I
[02:08:49] don't know I think I think I don't know
[02:08:51] how to explain it like league players
[02:08:53] are like it's like easier for them to be
[02:08:55] toxic in comparison to a voice chat game
[02:08:58] in my experience how the [ __ ] do I place
[02:09:00] this oh
[02:09:08] here stop yapping
[02:09:11] dude I will Yap as much as I want to Yap
[02:09:14] I'm
[02:09:17] sorry
[02:09:20] where uh landform Companion Animal main
[02:09:23] building outdoor Furnishing it's
[02:09:26] probably in it's probably in where the
[02:09:29] [ __ ] would it
[02:09:30] be is it just in
[02:09:33] mate it's probably
[02:09:35] here I will find it [ __ ] you
[02:09:40] chat it's not animals it's not competi
[02:09:42] it's not landscape wait is it landscape
[02:09:44] what the [ __ ] is
[02:09:47] landscape

[02:10:23] um here it
[02:10:26] is let put it let me put it like
[02:10:41] here anyways as I was saying voice ch
[02:10:44] games have like it's like toxic but it's
[02:10:46] more casual whereas League has like
[02:10:49] competitive racism cuz they type so
[02:10:51] that's the difference also also
[02:10:55] also yeah it's just like more
[02:10:57] competitive cuz it's like more anonymous
[02:10:58] because you don't have to like actually
[02:10:59] talk to someone so it's harder to like
[02:11:00] diffuse the situation that's it voice
[02:11:03] chat games just have more sexism which
[02:11:04] is unfortunate and terrible that it was
[02:11:06] my take okay let's let's change the
[02:11:09] music wait what the
[02:11:11] [ __ ] do I have to go one by one oh my

[02:17:46] face

[02:17:54] years yeah obviously anything related to
[02:17:57] child's lore they [ __ ] child mes are
[02:18:00] like worship on a
[02:18:01] statue I I respect it literally like
[02:18:15] yeah um I do agree with
[02:18:20] [Music]
[02:18:23] Zag the more I learn about
[02:18:25] skirk that uh I do think they they don't
[02:18:29] hoyse lowkey no disrespect no disrespect
[02:18:33] low key genin it doesn't really get
[02:18:36] characters that look like old like we
[02:18:39] all of our characters
[02:18:41] okay like like nevet and like dea look
[02:18:44] like a bit more like mature I guess like
[02:18:47] some like like some do but like I feel
[02:18:49] like they'll be like this character is
[02:18:51] like 7 million years old and they look
[02:18:53] like
[02:18:55] 18 or like 20 or like
[02:19:05] six the thly Shia well okay some
[02:19:08] characters can choose their appearance I
[02:19:10] don't know the lore of literally
[02:19:11] everyone but like I know Shia can like
[02:19:14] has a bird form he can like turn into a
[02:19:15] human he's an adeptive so he can like
[02:19:17] kind of choose venty like chose like his
[02:19:19] like dead friend or some [ __ ] like
[02:19:21] there's like lore behind some of the
[02:19:23] like some of
[02:19:25] that chose to be short he didn't choose
[02:19:28] to be
[02:19:31] short Madam ping true true actually true
[02:19:35] Madam
[02:19:39] ping like net looks more like mature I
[02:19:43] guess same with like kind of wait i l i
[02:19:47] I haven't zoomed into jangi in a while
[02:19:48] yeah I mean Jong Le I mean I don't know
[02:19:50] jangi also looks like
[02:19:55] 30 oh he's an archon archons can archons
[02:19:58] can do
[02:20:01] whatever a bit
[02:20:12] SW so if you could choose what form
[02:20:15] would you be I would be
[02:20:19] alam's pillow why the [ __ ] would I say
[02:20:22] that uh probably I don't know human can
[02:20:25] I you mean animal I like birds are cool
[02:20:26] you can fly and
[02:20:28] [ __ ] I want an animal that's just
[02:20:30] chilling like a cppy Bara cppy
[02:20:33] Bara Cy
[02:20:46] bar
[02:20:48] they're just
[02:21:09] vibing
[02:21:16] yeah
[02:21:20] what's the purpose of rizy in the party
[02:21:21] uh caul that's literally it he's just a
[02:21:23] friendship we're just doing a friendship
[02:21:25] team wait what is the take about skirk
[02:21:27] design cuz I initially I saw her I was
[02:21:29] like oh [ __ ] she looks sick and then
[02:21:31] after I like I was like oh shouldn't
[02:21:33] skirk look a little
[02:21:38] older that's it that's like my entire
[02:21:41] it's just like a hongkai
[02:21:44] character
[02:21:46] yeah
[02:21:49] but I haven't seen her in game yet I
[02:21:50] haven't done the ARA Quest so my take is
[02:21:52] bad she give a
[02:21:54] honish
[02:21:57] basic The Duality of the genin community
[02:22:00] one person said looks basic to the
[02:22:02] message above she is sex
[02:22:07] alarm tired of the waifu bait designs
[02:22:09] yeah but that's what sells so like I
[02:22:11] don't blame them but I do wish he looked
[02:22:14] at least a little like
[02:22:19] I don't I don't know how to say older in
[02:22:20] like a not weird
[02:22:23] way but like I mean she's pretty so I
[02:22:25] don't really like
[02:22:28] whatever mature yeah
[02:22:36] mature okay I saw what people said okay
[02:22:41] we don't talk about leaks here I don't
[02:22:42] look at leaks but on Twitter I saw like
[02:22:45] a character and how they looked and that
[02:22:49] character looked [ __ ] sick and
[02:22:52] apparently that was supposed to be I
[02:22:53] don't know we don't know but I'm just
[02:22:57] say what's bro cooking nothing we'll
[02:22:59] talk about
[02:23:04] [Applause]
[02:23:07] it do people want wrinkles no but
[02:23:09] there's a difference between looking
[02:23:11] like how do I explain
[02:23:14] this like there are reasons as to why a
[02:23:17] character like
[02:23:22] dea looks older than a character like
[02:23:25] ficial and so if your lore is like hey
[02:23:28] I'm a million years
[02:23:30] old it's more fitting to look princess
[02:23:34] like yeah I mean there's nothing wrong
[02:23:35] with the wrinkles either but it's more
[02:23:37] fitting to look a bit more like like
[02:23:40] like I don't know net than to look like
[02:23:43] [ __ ] who's a guy character that looks
[02:23:45] like ne4 like Chong
[02:23:54] Yun but yeah I mean also like I agree
[02:23:57] that de is also not
[02:24:05] like the side effect seems like an ecy
[02:24:08] sh looks minus four you're so funny I
[02:24:12] didn't laugh I have balls on the ground
[02:24:14] I do I'm actually going to cancel that
[02:24:16] one
[02:24:18] yeah de still looks like 20 20 something
[02:24:21] like it's not even like she looks like
[02:24:25] old but I like that she like doesn't
[02:24:28] look like a
[02:24:33] teenager but I don't really like I I
[02:24:35] don't really care I just play the game I
[02:24:36] don't really care that
[02:24:39] much HP go could be good but it's only
[02:24:41] crit
[02:24:45] damage should i g skir scars I think
[02:24:48] scars are sick my okay my cousin not to
[02:24:51] expose my cousin my cousin has like on
[02:24:54] his bicep he has like a like two like
[02:24:57] lines it looks like like a [ __ ] like
[02:24:59] claw scratch and it's I think some dumb
[02:25:00] [ __ ] like you walked into a door or
[02:25:02] something but it looks [ __ ] cool and
[02:25:04] you could just I would make I would
[02:25:06] pretend I [ __ ] wrestled the tiger or
[02:25:07] some [ __ ] and it's like the dumbest
[02:25:09] story but it looks
[02:25:11] sick I think scars look [ __ ]
[02:25:15] cool
[02:25:17] my dad has scars too my dad has a scar
[02:25:19] like it's like not super visible but he
[02:25:22] has a scar like on his face from when
[02:25:23] like a bartender chucked the chair at
[02:25:25] him cuz he normally bought him a drink
[02:25:28] and then one day he didn't cuz he was
[02:25:30] trying to impress a girl or something I
[02:25:31] don't remember and then he like I don't
[02:25:34] know the lore so he like the dude
[02:25:37] chucked the chair at him and then he
[02:25:38] like I don't
[02:25:40] know I don't
[02:25:45] remember nice story man dude [ __ ]

[02:44:44] pre-roll unless twitch changed something
[02:44:46] the only ads you get are pre-roll so the

[02:44:57] pretty sure I only have pre-rolls I
[02:44:58] don't actually run ads throughout the
[02:44:59] stream the only time I run ads is if
[02:45:01] someone with Channel points redeems run
[02:45:02] an ad which rarely happens but it
[02:45:04] happened two hours ago and I forgot
[02:45:06] about it but now you reminded me and so
[02:45:08] to punish you I'm going to run an ad get

[02:46:23] here she told me put my heart in a bag
[02:46:27] and nobody gets hurt sorry okay let's go
[02:46:33] here why am I here actually I don't know
[02:46:36] for
[02:46:42] enough my ears are bleeding sorry
[02:46:58] was it good a finina team for
[02:47:00] fun
[02:47:02] H I don't know I mean most of finina
[02:47:06] teams are fun depends who you like she's
[02:47:07] not a main DPS so I would do like finina
[02:47:09] and then a Healer it's like Jean BYU
[02:47:12] Charlotte
[02:47:13] Ma
[02:47:15] and then whatever DPS you like monoh
[02:47:17] Hydro is fun I agree kokomi finina and
[02:47:21] then yolan and Kaza that's fun or you
[02:47:23] could replace kakomi with
[02:47:25] Singo um and then run
[02:47:33] Jean Ayo also works B basically any
[02:47:36] Hydro
[02:47:41] Works seems like
[02:47:43] an
[02:47:46] the T
[02:47:49] be wander far on finina BYU good team
[02:47:52] but I would replace BYU with MAA because
[02:47:54] you get attack speed you get team wide
[02:47:56] healing with your burst and uh cryo
[02:47:59] which is good with wander because he can
[02:48:00] uh infus with it when he presses his
[02:48:02] skill then gain crit rate and benefit
[02:48:04] from the attack speed and also ma of the
[02:48:07] Knights of fonus
[02:48:10] true but I by is
[02:48:13] fine
[02:48:16] yeah but then you're using MAA okay
[02:48:20] true by your protect from getting
[02:48:21] knocked
[02:48:22] back
[02:48:25] yeah yeah yeah you get healing and
[02:48:27] shielding is just the dendo re like
[02:48:29] dendro does like nothing in that team
[02:48:31] that's the only
[02:48:36] problem you could also hear me out run a
[02:48:42] shielder like tank Fay right and you put
[02:48:45] it on Amber and then you also put your
[02:48:46] Scara on Amber and then your scar is the
[02:48:50] Healer windy plant okay

[03:02:23] I can see my true
[03:02:25] soulmate okay don't type gauge I'm just
[03:02:28] saying I've said this before if you're
[03:02:30] if you're locked into only being
[03:02:31] attracted to one of the two it just
[03:02:33] removes half the possibilities I'm not
[03:02:36] saying this as like a statement I'm just
[03:02:37] saying it objectively it's true so if
[03:02:39] I'm going to do a quiz that's purely
[03:02:41] personality why would there not be both
[03:02:44] if it's just a quiz bro is single
[03:02:47] clicking I [ __ ] forgot dude star you
[03:02:49] can't hold I
[03:02:55] forgot I'm just saying it's optimal
[03:02:58] that's
[03:02:59] all obviously it's not a choice I'm just
[03:03:02] saying it's
[03:03:12] optimal
[03:03:16] why is bro leveling Jade
[03:03:18] fall stop reminding
[03:03:20] me this weapon is a disgrace to the Jade
[03:03:24] name Jade spear amazing Jade cutter
[03:03:28] amazing Jade
[03:03:36] fall I'm wondering if bro likes women
[03:03:38] stop I
[03:03:41] do I still feel bad about a acally
[03:03:43] saying Fair like an hour ago I didn't
[03:03:45] mean it that way I lo I do why are you
[03:03:49] questioning all right J fall is lit we
[03:03:51] got a level 70 I mean it's not lit I
[03:03:53] hate this weapon but you know it's
[03:03:57] lit I just supp fin signature you should
[03:04:00] too you're lucky there's no mod here or
[03:04:02] you'd be bannned
[03:04:07] the
[03:04:12] time's
[03:04:13] I got forina signature first try okay
[03:04:15] you're lucky you're a mod or you'd be
[03:04:17] banned you look
[03:04:36] cute Chad this was not a statement about
[03:04:38] myself I was just saying it is
[03:04:42] optimal
[03:04:45] I pull for f sword and got harp wait
[03:04:47] that's actually not bad though unless
[03:04:48] you already had like a bunch of bows
[03:04:50] Harp's actually good harp is probably
[03:04:52] the best five star standard weapon you
[03:04:55] could get alongside Jade spear I think
[03:04:57] those are the two best right like missed
[03:04:59] five stars you could
[03:05:04] get
[03:05:06] alive oh wolves wolves is also up there
[03:05:09] the problem with Wolves though is that
[03:05:10] it's a claymore but yeah wolf is out
[03:05:14] there it just like I feel like there's
[03:05:15] way more like there's way more pole arms
[03:05:18] and bows that I use all the [ __ ] time
[03:05:21] but if you're like a
[03:05:22] claymore Karen a claymore Chris then
[03:05:26] yeah wolves is pretty sick too lost
[03:05:28] prayer lost prayer is uh okay okay okay
[03:05:32] I'm about to make people hate me look
[03:05:34] this is where I would put them okay this
[03:05:35] is standard Vander five stars okay aboba
[03:05:38] so catch is here okay let's put catch
[03:05:40] out there let's say let's say so where's
[03:05:42] where's Jade
[03:05:45] um where's harp it's probably these two
[03:05:49] are probably there wolves is like is
[03:05:52] here as a weapon but because there's
[03:05:54] less like staple Claymore supports
[03:05:57] they're using in every team it's
[03:05:58] probably here but let's still keep it
[03:06:01] there and then what are the other
[03:06:05] weapons wait let me add more let me add
[03:06:07] more
[03:06:12] tears
[03:06:14] okay where's
[03:06:16] okay uh what [ __ ] weapon did you say
[03:06:19] Amos Amos is like here Amos is like best
[03:06:21] in slot on on like me like it's
[03:06:24] technically not even M best slot on melt
[03:06:25] G I'm pretty sure because of diar's
[03:06:27] weapon and there's also like aqua and
[03:06:28] like like there's a bunch of weapons
[03:06:29] that are good now
[03:06:31] but it's like yeah it depends on who you
[03:06:35] have it's pretty it's pretty dog [ __ ]
[03:06:37] for most characters but then like G can
[03:06:39] use
[03:06:40] itats water is it could be a stats
[03:06:43] scy pride scy pride also suffers a
[03:06:46] similar syndrome where it's a claymore
[03:06:48] but some characters can use it like I
[03:06:49] know Ula if you can use the ER can make
[03:06:51] a lot of if you're a claymore DPS that
[03:06:53] can use the ER you can usually make use
[03:06:55] of it and it's
[03:06:56] decent like Ula like
[03:07:02] razorx bet to bet can use it uh serpent
[03:07:06] fine though the problem with okay
[03:07:08] another problem with claym Wars is
[03:07:09] serpent spine exists but it's a battle
[03:07:11] pass weapon so not everyone buys battle
[03:07:12] pass
[03:07:13] so it's like it's it's better like it's
[03:07:16] it's better than Amos for sure Aquilla
[03:07:19] is okay here's my Aquilla take this is
[03:07:21] my Aquilla take this is my Aquilla
[03:07:24] take I think Aquilla is very Niche but
[03:07:27] it's also super underrated because you
[03:07:30] literally just get a huge amount of base
[03:07:32] attack and like it's not insane for a
[03:07:34] five star okay but it's amazing for
[03:07:36] Bennett
[03:07:38] and even sometimes just the base attack
[03:07:42] plus the 20% attack you get makes it
[03:07:44] okay now you be like dude but like it's
[03:07:46] bad but listen okay sure it's not the
[03:07:49] best but it's like usually it CS to like
[03:07:53] similar to like another option that's
[03:07:56] like not bad let me try to find an
[03:08:00] example like look okay let's say you're
[03:08:03] playing AO what's a good weapon R5 Amin
[03:08:06] okay what's about as good as R5 aminova
[03:08:08] Aquilla it's about as good right this
[03:08:10] one gives you energy which is nice but
[03:08:12] it costs five
[03:08:13] uh prototypes billets quill is about as
[03:08:16] good it's like literally about as good
[03:08:18] it's not like for a five star that's
[03:08:20] pretty cope I get it for a five star but
[03:08:22] it's like you know it's okay how's scard
[03:08:25] Pride good Sky pride is not good for
[03:08:27] your account but it's good for certain
[03:08:29] characters like you like if you're a
[03:08:31] claymar DPS that can use it it's usually
[03:08:33] pretty good the only problem is Skyward
[03:08:35] serpent spine is usually better with
[03:08:36] their
[03:08:38] F but like you looking use
[03:08:42] well maybe it's like this maybe that's
[03:08:44] the thing
[03:08:46] also
[03:08:51] look I'm going to be honest chat the
[03:08:53] only reason I did this was to talk about
[03:08:54] lost prayer cuz someone said to talk
[03:08:55] about lost prayer I think lost
[03:08:58] prayer is really good but it's like one
[03:09:01] under those maybe maybe it's like this
[03:09:03] is it like
[03:09:05] this cuz loster also kind of want you to
[03:09:07] be on field if not it's a stat stick
[03:09:10] which is fine but I would put atlasa
[03:09:12] ioki
[03:09:14] kind of like Atlas better am I weird for
[03:09:17] liking Atlas better I like Atlas better
[03:09:19] Atlas is like always a good stat stick
[03:09:21] unless you don't care about attack L
[03:09:23] rayer is sometimes better if you're on
[03:09:24] field but it's like kind of like alas
[03:09:29] better but I don't know if they're the
[03:09:31] same tier as
[03:09:36] harp it's also not the same tier as
[03:09:38] Skyward
[03:09:40] Pride might just be high higher in the
[03:09:42] tier it might be like
[03:09:44] this maybe this is
[03:09:46] there I actually don't know no but whith
[03:09:52] exists I know W is not amazing but I
[03:09:54] feel like okay let me let me elaborate
[03:09:55] on that I feel like there's more good
[03:09:57] fourstar and even three star well
[03:09:59] thrilling Tails Catalyst for a lot of
[03:10:01] characters there's a lot of good fourar
[03:10:07] catalysts like okay I Loki struggle to
[03:10:10] pick I mean they're stringless I was
[03:10:12] going to a lot of my bow characters I
[03:10:14] struggle to pick a bow to level like
[03:10:16] yeah some characters can use rust like
[03:10:18] yoia that's it some can use stringless
[03:10:21] yeah range gauge just came
[03:10:25] out your Whit's number one fan I [ __ ]
[03:10:28] love wiith I know there's like downsides
[03:10:30] to using it but I am the [ __ ] biggest
[03:10:32] whith lover but I know I know it's kind
[03:10:35] of but even dude Floy Purity is actually
[03:10:37] insane Floy Purity is really good Floy
[03:10:40] Purity is genuinely great like actually
[03:10:42] actually good especially if you can use
[03:10:44] it like you have to use its effect but
[03:10:45] like it can give like what's the full
[03:10:48] Elemental damage bonus it can give I
[03:10:49] forget it's like wasn't it 60 or some
[03:10:51] [ __ ] let me see let me see R5 it would
[03:10:53] be uh 24 Elemental damage bonus plus
[03:10:58] okay it's not that much it would be 24 +
[03:11:00] 8
[03:11:04] time just plus eight so
[03:11:08] 32 oh no a would be times would be
[03:11:11] double as well would that be 16 so it'
[03:11:12] be 24 + 16 so 40 yeah 40% that's really
[03:11:19] good there's a lot of good Catalyst like
[03:11:21] sack frags for a lot of characters well
[03:11:23] this is a battle pass weapon but it's
[03:11:24] good prototype Amber is great even okay
[03:11:26] ignore this even like ballad is good
[03:11:29] even like most of the event ones are
[03:11:30] actually pretty
[03:11:34] good have fun getting em buff that's the
[03:11:36] cool part though if you're doing casual
[03:11:38] content who cares if you're doing Abyss
[03:11:40] you can always reset you're either High
[03:11:42] Enough investment to where it doesn't
[03:11:43] matter or you're not and then you can
[03:11:45] reset and then Whit for you is better
[03:11:48] than it is on average because you get
[03:11:49] the two good Buffs and if you don't well
[03:11:51] you retried I get that that's a not a
[03:11:53] fun play style but it's literally like
[03:11:55] Wiz can help you cheese content that you
[03:11:56] otherwise can't clear also whenever we
[03:11:59] calc it in like videos and z c it it's
[03:12:01] on average of the three and usually it
[03:12:02] still performs pretty well which is why
[03:12:04] I like the weapon but I get why some
[03:12:07] people don't like it so fair
[03:12:09] enough the amb buff is
[03:12:11] annoying uh
[03:12:14] anyways what are the other ones Aquilla
[03:12:16] is probably I'm an Aquilla lover but I
[03:12:18] do think it's like not the it's it's
[03:12:21] just a benit weapon and then if not it's
[03:12:23] okay if there was like a physical sword
[03:12:26] DPS that actually physical physical it
[03:12:28] would be amazing because the base stack
[03:12:30] in the attack perent is already decent
[03:12:32] and it like has like its effect if it if
[03:12:34] you could use the physical that'd be
[03:12:37] great but most characters
[03:12:41] can't uh I don't think it's it's
[03:12:43] lowkey is it
[03:12:45] here it might be
[03:12:50] there cuz if Amos is only for ganu well
[03:12:53] it's not only for G but if it's mostly
[03:12:55] for ganu then this is mostly for
[03:12:57] Bennett but benett is better than G true
[03:13:03] anyways uh what are other ones there
[03:13:05] Skyward okay I ly okay no disrespect to
[03:13:08] skywards fine but I I actually forgot
[03:13:11] about that I pulled this weap every time
[03:13:13] I see it in my inventory I remember and
[03:13:14] then I never level it it's it's just the
[03:13:17] worst fav a lot of the time it's not bad
[03:13:19] sometimes it's nice because you have a
[03:13:21] high base stack gives you some Er like
[03:13:23] let's say your sh has zero ER you can
[03:13:25] actually use this some characters can
[03:13:26] use this but for most supports which is
[03:13:29] one the ER would be want also the base
[03:13:30] tack is really high but for most
[03:13:31] supports that would want
[03:13:33] ER you just go
[03:13:37] fa oh wait actually actually update it
[03:13:40] is similar to The Catch I remember it's
[03:13:42] similar to The Catch for Ryden and also
[03:13:45] Shang Ling I believe which means what
[03:13:47] you could do is you could give catch to
[03:13:48] one and then scour to the other you fish
[03:13:50] with a catch give that to one you go SC
[03:13:52] other the problem is and I also have
[03:13:53] this problem with people that pull for
[03:13:55] scarlet for Shang Ling which yes it
[03:13:56] could be a best in slot it's not bad
[03:13:58] it's just Shang Ling has like a million
[03:14:00] [ __ ] weapons like she literally can
[03:14:02] use almost any [ __ ] weapon she can
[03:14:04] use Dragon Bane she can use catch she
[03:14:06] can use like any [ __ ] five star she
[03:14:07] can use so much so it's like it being a
[03:14:10] Shang Ling weapon is not like the big
[03:14:12] biggest deal like you could use this on
[03:14:13] Ryden and then give cash Shang Ling it's
[03:14:16] okay it's actually okay
[03:14:18] um yeah ryen weapon looks good with him
[03:14:22] dude Fang hi I literally hav't I've
[03:14:24] literally been running engulfing sh cuz
[03:14:25] it matches his pants anyways
[03:14:28] um yeah I think Sky SP is decent it's
[03:14:32] decent but Fab usually is better so I
[03:14:34] put it like here cuz like same with Sky
[03:14:36] Pride it's good but usually Serpent's
[03:14:37] fine but Ser SP is a batt pass weapon
[03:14:39] but anyways I digress uh what else is
[03:14:41] there we'll rearrange this later scard
[03:14:43] sword I kind of don't give a [ __ ] about
[03:14:45] uh it's not bad it's actually decent
[03:14:47] again it falls into the I just would use
[03:14:50] fa syndrome I genuinely haven't used my
[03:14:53] skywood sword since when I used to use
[03:14:55] it on Gene but now I use either fav or
[03:14:57] Amin um not because they're inherently
[03:15:00] better but I mean it's decent it has a
[03:15:03] high base no it's not even that high
[03:15:04] it's 608 has a lot of
[03:15:06] er usually I feel like if I need ER on
[03:15:10] my support Fab help my other party
[03:15:13] members so it's better but if you are
[03:15:16] using fou for someone else gu is fine um
[03:15:18] I'm using a better right now cuz I'm on
[03:15:20] a full healer benett build I don't want
[03:15:22] to talk about it oh we have 40K HP um
[03:15:26] anyways Sky would get on gen it's not
[03:15:28] yeah it's not
[03:15:30] bad jeans standard weapons are fav and
[03:15:35] Amin but sky is also pretty
[03:15:39] good but it doesn't help your team it
[03:15:41] just helps her
[03:15:44] hard to proc fav no you just Swap and
[03:15:46] press e you can go crit
[03:15:51] ciret you can't get enough crit rate on
[03:15:53] healer Bennett for fav I'm not going fav
[03:15:56] on healer Bennett what the
[03:15:59] [ __ ]
[03:16:05] anyways uh what's another standard five
[03:16:09] star if I'm not remembering it it's
[03:16:11] probably badad
[03:16:14] is that
[03:16:22] it okay that's
[03:16:25] it low key okay if we're being generous
[03:16:28] with tears it's
[03:16:32] like where does this go
[03:16:36] wait where the [ __ ] does this
[03:16:40] go it's like okay I mean is it even
[03:16:45] better than Aquilla for your
[03:16:48] account I'm kind of [ __ ] benit pilled
[03:16:54] though I guess it
[03:16:57] is like I got I got aula is the first
[03:17:01] faster weapon I got in
[03:17:03] 1.0 and I've been using it every s I've
[03:17:06] literally never stopped using this
[03:17:07] weapon but
[03:17:10] also it's just Bennett base attack so
[03:17:13] like I get
[03:17:14] it but yeah everyone also uses Bennett
[03:17:21] generally is Jade better than Calamity
[03:17:22] if I have enough crit rate if you have
[03:17:24] too much crit rate uh a non crit weapon
[03:17:25] is going to be better Calamity is
[03:17:27] actually really good especially if
[03:17:28] you're running Mari Jade is better on
[03:17:30] average but not always so you can use uh
[03:17:33] Calamity pretty sure it could be the
[03:17:36] best than I see but
[03:17:41] yeah
[03:17:45] SC the first weapon I got has my Ben
[03:17:47] side that's
[03:17:49] fair but also like Aquilla is better so
[03:17:52] if it's like your Bennett's weapon then
[03:17:54] Aquilla would be a bit
[03:17:55] better I'll just leave them
[03:17:57] there although I think aquilla's I
[03:18:00] actually think aquilla's not bad is it
[03:18:09] bad what do it rank on like a random ass
[03:18:11] character let me look at some random ass
[03:18:13] weapon
[03:18:14] ranking uh who's a random ass sword
[03:18:17] character
[03:18:22] chat kaching it's good for physical
[03:18:25] kaching but no one [ __ ] plays that
[03:18:33] anymore do I have it in my [ __ ] do I
[03:18:35] have ailla my in our weapon wrecking
[03:18:38] kaching
[03:18:41] guide I have it can make this weapon I
[03:18:43] don't if I
[03:18:45] do
[03:18:47] 99.6 yeah I mean for yeah exactly yeah
[03:18:50] for for aggravate it's as good as iron s
[03:18:53] R1 but then R5 is better wait why was R1
[03:18:56] the the average the percentage
[03:18:58] anyways yeah I guess it's pretty bad
[03:19:07] there okay
[03:19:10] fine okay low key can I put Amos in his
[03:19:12] own tier is that
[03:19:18] toxic how much better is Amos than harp
[03:19:20] on G I'm actually curious
[03:19:23] [Applause]
[03:19:28] ganu let's
[03:19:32] see do they Cal it or have I pull up my
[03:19:35] do my I haven't made a g gu in forever I
[03:19:36] don't have
[03:19:38] Cals uh
[03:19:41] melt
[03:19:42] 113 to 117 wait it's literally not even
[03:19:46] that much what the
[03:20:00] [ __ ] wait it's it's next to hamay
[03:20:10] Yumi
[03:20:16] it almost has three characters Aquila
[03:20:17] has one Aquila is okay if you just want
[03:20:19] to attack like for AA and you don't have
[03:20:21] like an R5 amima but also Bennett is
[03:20:24] better than those three characters
[03:20:25] combined Bennett is better than the
[03:20:27] three Amos characters combined times
[03:20:40] two
[03:20:54] is this based I think I re I like these
[03:20:56] weapons a lot this is also pretty good
[03:20:58] but it just feels weird to not put
[03:21:04] harp I actually think it's this I
[03:21:10] mean yeah I actually think it's this I
[03:21:13] like actually think is
[03:21:23] this wolves is a [ __ ] weapon no it's not
[03:21:26] wolves is good wolves is great the only
[03:21:28] Okay the reason why I could see you
[03:21:30] putting wolves here and I wouldn't
[03:21:31] disagree is because of serpent spine but
[03:21:33] serpent spine is a battle pass weapon
[03:21:35] and I don't actually know how what's the
[03:21:37] percentage of people that get and refine
[03:21:39] a serent spine I don't actually know the
[03:21:40] percentage but serent spine is [ __ ]
[03:21:42] broken but outside of ser fine wolves
[03:21:45] gra Zone's
[03:21:46] insane it's just so many stats dude 608
[03:21:50] 50 attack 20 attack
[03:21:54] here and un like duuke or like whatever
[03:21:57] like pretend deluke was as good as Hut I
[03:21:58] know he's not but just pretend duuk was
[03:22:00] what the
[03:22:04] [ __ ] oh I was just in a
[03:22:08] domain the [ __ ] was
[03:22:10] that yeah I guess we won't pretend the
[03:22:12] Lucas utau I'm
[03:22:14] sorry anyways pretend like this is a
[03:22:17] really good Claymore character right you
[03:22:18] just go em Sands and then you have a
[03:22:20] [ __ ] ton of attack you have a [ __ ] ton
[03:22:21] of em you're
[03:22:22] chilling that's even without the second
[03:22:24] part of the passive because it's
[03:22:26] inconsistent but I feel like a lot of
[03:22:27] abysses now have single Target boss and
[03:22:30] then another floor that has a bunch of
[03:22:31] enemies that you can proc its effect and
[03:22:32] when you do it Buffs all your party if
[03:22:34] you're playing SRO it doesn't snapshot
[03:22:37] which is good cuz this effect usually
[03:22:38] procs mid mid nut and if you are
[03:22:40] snapshotting with like fish then you
[03:22:42] could just swap it to them it's annoying
[03:22:44] with like bet though cuz BET's going to
[03:22:45] snapshot but I don't know it's usually
[03:22:48] good says the crit Andy yes I'm a crit
[03:22:50] value Andy and I'm acknowledging that
[03:22:52] wolves is generally really good stat
[03:22:55] stick like look I'll pull up a random
[03:22:57] [ __ ] Claymore again who's a random
[03:22:58] Claymore itto no but Ito doesn't want to
[03:23:01] attack really I mean he you
[03:23:03] know all right [ __ ] it it where even is
[03:23:07] it forto actually itto can use
[03:23:10] it
[03:23:13] yeah okay for EO it's like white
[03:23:15] blind that the worst example okay what
[03:23:20] about Ula it's actually not bad for YULA
[03:23:24] I I know it's not bad for YULA this is
[03:23:25] old as [ __ ] I haven't made an updated
[03:23:28] you video either
[03:23:37] um check out this Excel sheet of a bunch
[03:23:40] of builds
[03:23:44] oh this is 2.7 okay that take this with
[03:23:46] a grand assault this is
[03:23:52] 2.7 one's 3.8 but they don't have a
[03:23:54] weapon ranking I should probably make a
[03:23:56] new Ula guide
[03:23:59] down yeah it's usually with a with most
[03:24:03] characters it's like instantly best in
[03:24:05] slot if you can Pro the passive but it's
[03:24:06] kind of hard to anyways wolves is really
[03:24:09] good I just think Claymores are
[03:24:11] characters a lot of the times are just
[03:24:13] Claymore characters like EO would want
[03:24:15] like a defense weapon or a crit weapon
[03:24:18] and then like you can get serent spine
[03:24:19] and like bet can use that and like it's
[03:24:21] kind of hard to proc the effect but as a
[03:24:22] weapon it's really [ __ ]
[03:24:30] good how this turn into weapon ranking I
[03:24:33] don't know if I like
[03:24:39] it yeah
[03:24:44] [Music]
[03:24:52] uh I don't know about these four these
[03:24:55] four I actually don't know either
[03:24:56] they're I think this makes sense
[03:24:58] actually cuz these two individually are
[03:25:00] better than these
[03:25:01] two cuz like here you usually fav
[03:25:04] whereas fav Claymore doesn't really
[03:25:05] replace a fav a Skyward blade fav Lance
[03:25:09] does repl a SC replace a Skyward spine
[03:25:12] but Skyward spine also I feel like has
[03:25:15] more characters that would want to use
[03:25:17] it h is that even true is Skyward spine
[03:25:21] better than Skyward
[03:25:23] blade maybe it isn't uh but there's more
[03:25:26] DPSS I could use it cuz the wait what's
[03:25:28] the base attack on it it's low right no
[03:25:31] it's high oh wait it's high but blade is
[03:25:33] low that's why I'm a
[03:25:35] genius
[03:25:37] right this one's high but Skyward blade
[03:25:40] is low which means means you need more
[03:25:42] ER you need to need more ER to use blade
[03:25:45] and you need to need less ER to use
[03:25:46] spine which means more DPSS can use
[03:25:49] spine than DPS is that can use blade
[03:25:51] efficiently true okay I actually lowkey
[03:25:54] agree with this spine also gives a bit
[03:25:56] of crit rate wait doesn't sword also
[03:25:57] give some oh yeah it's eight versus four
[03:26:04] right SC higher thanks to SRO I mean SRO
[03:26:08] doesn't I mean yeah he can use it
[03:26:12] but Singo can also use
[03:26:17] everything Jade cutter Jade cutter is
[03:26:19] not on standard Jade cutter if Jade
[03:26:21] cutter was on standard Jade cutter would
[03:26:23] be like
[03:26:27] here like maybe like top of the tier
[03:26:35] but why is pride so high it's bad pride
[03:26:38] is okay but it's just rare that it's
[03:26:40] like okay realistically it's like this
[03:26:42] cuz you just play fav like where the
[03:26:44] [ __ ] is fav you realistically it's this
[03:26:46] I mean fav is the best weapon but
[03:26:47] realistically like fav beats these
[03:26:50] weapons other than Aquilla cuz
[03:26:55] Bennett but
[03:26:58] like scy pride is like rarely scy Pride
[03:27:02] doesn't have that many characters that
[03:27:03] can use it but the characters that can
[03:27:04] use it can use it well like like Ula and
[03:27:07] like even like EO if he needs ER right
[03:27:10] I'm not coping right
[03:27:21] accessible yeah ah but white blind's a
[03:27:24] bit higher okay maybe I am
[03:27:29] coping but that's an R5 white blind it's
[03:27:32] also it's above the other five stars I
[03:27:40] mean
[03:27:47] the vacuum blades are genuinely not bad
[03:27:49] oh that's also another thing yes I
[03:27:52] [ __ ] okay also skard pride has
[03:27:55] scalings because skard it literally wait
[03:27:57] wait wait let me pull up uh what website
[03:28:00] should I use I'll use this one wait
[03:28:02] where the [ __ ] is the first one because
[03:28:03] scard Pride actually does
[03:28:07] damage on its effect it literally can
[03:28:10] help save a character whose motion
[03:28:12] values are dog [ __ ] so let's say you're
[03:28:13] playing F your weapons passive can like
[03:28:16] do more than your F so it becomes
[03:28:18] immediately amazing from true
[03:28:26] true so I think there's a case to be
[03:28:29] made for this weapon um I actually think
[03:28:31] it's not bad High base attack good
[03:28:33] effect if you can use the ER there's not
[03:28:35] that many on like DPS claymor that want
[03:28:37] all those stats but those that do can
[03:28:40] use this weapon well I actually think
[03:28:41] it's not bad I actually don't think it's
[03:28:48] bad is still better compared to Atlas uh
[03:28:52] I think Atlas usually is slightly better
[03:28:53] for off fielders isn't
[03:28:56] it actually I know it
[03:29:01] is no wait really let me
[03:29:07] see if it isn't then it goes up
[03:29:16] oh wait they're about the same okay
[03:29:17] maybe they're the same then okay fair
[03:29:20] let me pull some stuff up for yi I have
[03:29:23] it
[03:29:25] at I have it at 108
[03:29:29] 109 108
[03:29:32] 109 okay Dad maybe they are about as
[03:29:37] good and lost prer can be better on
[03:29:39] field okay maybe I like lost prer more
[03:29:41] than than I thought okay you've changed
[03:29:43] my mind maybe I do like it more than I
[03:29:47] thought cuz some characters that are
[03:29:49] like CLE scar like whoever you're on
[03:29:50] Fielding can actually use it quite a bit
[03:29:53] maybe I like it a bit
[03:30:02] better easier to gear yeah it gives you
[03:30:04] crit
[03:30:06] rate B can use scard Pride yeah she can
[03:30:09] the servant fine is always servant fine
[03:30:10] but it's a batt pass
[03:30:12] weapon okay I agree I like this a bit
[03:30:15] better it's probably this then cuz it's
[03:30:18] probably this or this you could you
[03:30:20] could probably argue that this is also
[03:30:22] arguable but wolves is
[03:30:25] like I feel like when genin's finished
[03:30:28] genin version 7.0 we're going to have
[03:30:31] enough good Claymores that wols is going
[03:30:33] to be
[03:30:40] here
[03:30:41] but it yeah I think this makes sense you
[03:30:44] could argue this but I kind of don't
[03:30:47] want to do that argument right now I'm
[03:30:48] going to leave it here for
[03:30:51] now you can also I mean I hate gen imp
[03:30:55] back okay we're going to leave it here
[03:30:56] let's not talk don't talk if you talk
[03:30:59] I'm
[03:31:01] angry donated I know we have resin take
[03:31:05] it to a publisher buddy the resin is
[03:31:07] yearning to be spent cosplay when
[03:31:17] Bro think he's a Jeff dude I'm trying to
[03:31:20] get back in tune with the weapon side of
[03:31:21] me
[03:31:23] okay I need to refine my weapon
[03:31:36] takes 30 minutes till reset
[03:31:39] XD
[03:31:49] true the
[03:31:51] TI's time to
[03:31:57] shine your
[03:32:02] head I love tier list
[03:32:05] content
[03:32:09] okay
[03:32:11] I mean they're fun but being wrong is
[03:32:21] scary rank the rank the pipe and fish
[03:32:24] bow pipe is pretty good but festering
[03:32:27] desire is better and fishbo is complete
[03:32:29] garbage but it's a fish so it's the
[03:32:34] best someone always say you're wrong
[03:32:36] yeah I mean sometimes I'm wrong I think
[03:32:37] lost prayer is better than I thought 5
[03:32:39] minutes ago I mean I knew it was good
[03:32:41] but I thought alas was a bit better but
[03:32:42] I think now I think uh lost PR is a bit
[03:32:46] better which is good we learned
[03:32:59] [Music]
[03:33:06] something spoken like a true
[03:33:09] pescatarian no I eat meat I don't know
[03:33:12] what that
[03:33:14] is I support it
[03:33:17] though zff is vegan I
[03:33:25] think a bit to swallow seems like an
[03:33:28] Emer be
[03:33:35] Sanctified he doesn't know sag well like
[03:33:38] I'm not like I don't ask him about it
[03:33:40] every day like I know he's been for like
[03:33:42] two years but I'm not like I I feel like
[03:33:44] if you call like okay I feel like if I
[03:33:46] if I say he's vegan without like seeing
[03:33:48] him for like a while I don't want to
[03:33:50] like make him feel like if he like
[03:33:52] decided to stop being then it would like
[03:33:54] be like like he traed so I'm I like I
[03:33:57] don't know ask him I don't [ __ ] know
[03:33:58] I'm not ask him every
[03:34:04] day vegan team comp uh Nikita Neu kakomi
[03:34:09] probably n Bloom with
[03:34:12] Bloom is is
[03:34:18] vegetables you going to flex the last
[03:34:20] slot fake
[03:34:25] friend be
[03:34:27] humble me with so that's why bro is
[03:34:30] always waffling about salads and
[03:34:32] [ __ ] the
[03:34:37] side
[03:34:39] true
[03:34:41] Sil hello this is my first
[03:34:44] message on Chad hello
[03:34:58] Yulie this could be good I mean this
[03:35:01] could be
[03:35:02] good hey there's a
[03:35:09] prime
[03:35:16] okay
[03:35:18] listen Mr potatoes I appreciate your
[03:35:20] contributions but you are getting one
[03:35:22] guide this person has been waffling
[03:35:25] about Skyward Pride being amazing on S
[03:35:28] for like 10 messages
[03:35:30] literally s best SL Sky blaz best for S
[03:35:34] SRO xq xq SRO plus Skyward best SRO is
[03:35:37] as good as Benny so Skyward SS plus tier
[03:35:40] go Skyward up because s Joe skard
[03:35:42] Aquilla Skyward even higher thanks to S
[03:35:45] Joe sky is literally s Jo's me slot
[03:35:47] Skyward too low as s Jo's
[03:35:55] slot look dude it's good on S Cho
[03:36:00] okay
[03:36:05] sure but you are
[03:36:09] coping
[03:36:18] SRO can use like 50 weapons there's
[03:36:20] weapons that make him feel better at low
[03:36:22] investment like a refined Sack or
[03:36:26] fav um but Skyward is also good I mean
[03:36:29] any of the limited like Jade cutter is
[03:36:31] also pretty
[03:36:34] cracked but you know that's
[03:36:37] fine it's fine Sky's good
[03:36:43] good fa is the best true fa is the
[03:37:00] best right let me
[03:37:09] see
[03:37:13] okay not to be a not to be a a a a
[03:37:15] weapon percentage Andy again but Jade
[03:37:19] Mis spitter Haron Loi Skyward wolfang
[03:37:23] sack R3 106
[03:37:26] 103 freeo Play Weapon is 104 Skyward is
[03:37:30] 2% over a freeo playay weapon Are
[03:37:32] Beautiful Creatures Two granted I was
[03:37:34] defending Aquilla be sure to them and
[03:37:38] cause them no harm
[03:37:42] what about C6 is it better oo it is
[03:37:45] finale is 117 I mean pretty similar 3%
[03:37:48] more than a free to playay
[03:37:51] weapon
[03:37:54] anyways anyways I think it's pretty good
[03:37:58] I'm not I'm not a SC I think Sky's good
[03:38:00] I mean I love Aquilla I think Aquilla is
[03:38:02] [ __ ] great I just am biased which is
[03:38:04] why I put it here I think scy pride is
[03:38:06] uh scy blade is as good it's just scy
[03:38:08] blade is low base stack High ER so it's
[03:38:10] like less flexible than these two
[03:38:11] weapons in my
[03:38:15] opinion for you it's like this then sure
[03:38:18] we can do
[03:38:19] this I mean okay realistically it might
[03:38:21] be this I'm actually not against this
[03:38:23] but just because the sing CH chatter is
[03:38:25] here I'm putting this here just for you
[03:38:27] just because just because you're in
[03:38:28] timeout right
[03:38:35] now doesn't take into account up time
[03:38:37] wait what up time of sro's burst or of
[03:38:40] the
[03:38:42] passive of like scour blades active 608
[03:38:45] is not low base stack yes it is when
[03:38:46] we're talking about 608 versus 674 when
[03:38:48] we're talking about Skyward weapons if
[03:38:50] we're talking about 608 versus where is
[03:38:52] uh my bow character do I have a bow
[03:38:54] character anywhere here no I don't where
[03:38:56] the [ __ ] if we're talking about 608
[03:38:58] versus
[03:38:59] 674 608 is a lot lower because you get a
[03:39:02] lot of ER with a lower base stack versus
[03:39:05] a big base stack like more base stack
[03:39:07] and base stack skills is the anyways and
[03:39:09] less are and the Bas attack is really
[03:39:11] important because attack percent you get
[03:39:13] go uh is scales off of your characters
[03:39:16] characters attack and your weapons
[03:39:21] attack ER is good though not as good as
[03:39:24] Bas attack usually not always some
[03:39:27] supports just want ER but Bas stack is
[03:39:30] so okay here's the thing here is the
[03:39:32] only reasoning why I Am pro High base
[03:39:36] stack Skyward over High ER Skyward
[03:39:39] because D let's say you're playing Ula
[03:39:42] let me show you something okay let me
[03:39:44] pull up two weapons right now I have a
[03:39:46] lot of tabs let's say you're playing Ula
[03:39:48] okay and you have two options you either
[03:39:50] have Skyward Pride
[03:39:52] or uh where's Skyward
[03:39:56] blade Let's ignore everything else about
[03:39:59] this weapon let's say you're playing Ula
[03:40:00] and you want either 674 base stack and
[03:40:03] 36 ER or 608 B stack and 55 v a lot of
[03:40:07] DPSS there's a good chance you don't
[03:40:09] need 5 ER Ula probably doesn't need 55
[03:40:12] ER if you're playing a good team you
[03:40:13] probably don't need that much you want
[03:40:14] ER you want like 30 40 right you can use
[03:40:16] the 40 but you probably can't use the
[03:40:18] [ __ ] 55 so having this Bas stack is a
[03:40:21] lot better other than the rest of the
[03:40:23] effect for a lot of characters now I
[03:40:25] know some characters skill on HP some
[03:40:26] characters are supports that just want
[03:40:28] ER that's cool but I think having the
[03:40:31] high Bas stack low ER makes a weapon
[03:40:33] that could be good on a Support also
[03:40:35] good on some DPSS same with Skyward um
[03:40:39] Skyward Pro spine Skyward
[03:40:43] spine Skyward spine if this had 55 ER
[03:40:47] and you use it on Sha I laugh at you I
[03:40:50] laugh at you but if it has 36 maybe you
[03:40:53] might have extra fiveish ER 10 maybe but
[03:40:56] that's okay 674 base attack eight crit
[03:40:59] rate that's not bad it's okay it's not
[03:41:03] amazing but if it was 60855 would' be a
[03:41:06] lot
[03:41:07] worse Sky spine also gives attack speed
[03:41:10] I know I'm like I'm just talking about
[03:41:12] the the stats right
[03:41:14] now did Fang say something why is
[03:41:16] everyone meowing Val when would you want
[03:41:18] to Val tonight
[03:41:24] [Applause]
[03:41:26] actually appreciate
[03:41:28] golden so that's just that those are
[03:41:30] just my thoughts but I don't think scy
[03:41:32] blade is bad I don't think it's
[03:41:34] inherently a tier lower but I think
[03:41:36] because the stat line is worse it's like
[03:41:38] a little bit worse which is why I put it
[03:41:39] here for the visual representation
[03:41:42] that's
[03:41:49] all I actually really want to put this
[03:41:51] here the more I think about this weapon
[03:41:54] the more I want to put it there but
[03:41:56] Callis have really good free to play
[03:41:57] options too uh that's also true okay I
[03:42:00] got to move on I got to move on when is
[03:42:03] he going to spend his
[03:42:04] resin don't talk to
[03:42:08] me taking a turn for
[03:42:11] the spine has to be the best Skyward
[03:42:14] okay you are baiting stop stop go go
[03:42:17] stop
[03:42:18] stop
[03:42:28] stop keep
[03:42:38] going
[03:42:47] SP as good as catch on Ryden wow it's as
[03:42:49] good as a freeo Play Weapon you really
[03:42:51] you really got me surely Skyward harp is
[03:42:54] worse than every freeo play
[03:42:57] bow I mean sometimes it is protype
[03:43:00] Crescent and hamay Yumi are are pretty
[03:43:01] good like the free play bows are pretty
[03:43:04] good I I acknowledge that but Harve is
[03:43:07] just too good man harp is like pretty
[03:43:09] crack stat stick for like
[03:43:13] anyone also yeah everyone does get an R1

[04:12:45] making my last couple months better I've
[04:12:48] girl problems recently but watching your
[04:12:50] streams helped me stay positive Z I
[04:12:52] don't know how I help but I'm glad I did
[04:12:55] I appreciate
[04:13:03] it why do you keep so many mediocre
[04:13:06] pieces cuz if I I throw a piece that has
[04:13:08] like 20 crit damage and like f like 10
[04:13:10] crit rate no that's a lot if I have a
[04:13:12] piece that has like 10 crit damage 10
[04:13:13] crit rate everyone be like oh my God how
[04:13:15] did you throw that I literally I
[04:13:17] literally would go to my local
[04:13:19] supermarket and and and and pee on the
[04:13:21] wall for a piece like that and I don't
[04:13:23] want you guys to do that don't do that
[04:13:24] don't pee on a wall what the [ __ ] so I
[04:13:27] don't want to throw a piece that you
[04:13:28] would do something like that for I don't
[04:13:30] want to do that I don't to throw that
[04:13:31] for you that's weird why would I throw
[04:13:36] thats like
[04:13:37] let the mighty be
[04:13:43] humble what you're weird okay listen
[04:13:47] first of all don't do that second of all
[04:13:49] in game third of all it was a hyp it was
[04:13:52] a metaphor and a hyperbole okay I was an
[04:13:55] exaggeration for comedic
[04:14:06] effect
[04:14:08] dude we need when we get the anemo
[04:14:10] archon they need to be able to float
[04:14:11] finina can walk on water so can kakomi
[04:14:14] but we need to get an anemo character
[04:14:16] that can just like walk on the air like
[04:14:18] I'm not saying like scar like but like
[04:14:21] actually just like walk on
[04:14:31] air venti
[04:14:35] exists you guys typing sus
[04:14:37] I feel like you guys know something I
[04:14:40] don't am I am I predicting something
[04:14:43] right
[04:14:56] now okay
[04:15:06] anyways
[04:15:11] yeah and the Geo archon walks on land
[04:15:26] true I'm going to ride till I can't no
[04:15:31] more got my horses in the
[04:15:36] back
[04:15:38] oh and the Pyro archon the Pyro archon
[04:15:41] doesn't take damage from burning grass
[04:15:47] imagine it heals
[04:15:54] them the [ __ ] the Pyro barrels the
[04:15:57] like the the barrels that explode they
[04:15:58] heal
[04:16:05] them is it the same ZX as YouTube no no
[04:16:08] it's a different one it's a different
[04:16:10] one yeah you should run actually you
[04:16:12] should I mean I you're welcome here but
[04:16:14] that's a different that's a different
[04:16:15] person uh I love his guides though love
[04:16:17] his guides love his
[04:16:27] content why I can't animation canel
[04:16:35] it okay chat I'm going to uncap the last
[04:16:39] bit later cuz I'm so [ __ ] tired uh
[04:16:43] but I'll do it like before I sleep like
[04:16:44] in bed but before we go let's level some
[04:16:47] pieces what do I have what do I have
[04:16:48] what do I have we have so many pieces uh
[04:16:52] D I'm just begging but I'm probably
[04:16:53] going to level something what the [ __ ]
[04:16:55] are we yo what about okay I have a lot
[04:16:58] of pieces that could get a good for sub
[04:17:00] stat but I kind of am too lazy to level
[04:17:01] all of them so should I throw them like
[04:17:03] strong box them or should I keep them
[04:17:04] cuz they technically could be good but I
[04:17:07] don't know if it's worth the like Mora
[04:17:08] and artifact
[04:17:15] XP level to four yeah that's usually
[04:17:18] what I do but it's like so [ __ ]
[04:17:22] tedious and then you get disappointed
[04:17:24] cuz they're not going to get
[04:17:27] anything if this gets crit damage I will
[04:17:30] literally okay if this guy crit damage I
[04:17:33] will
[04:17:35] actually actually
[04:17:40] if this gets crit damage I will
[04:17:53] actually this you do the archon quest
[04:17:56] okay fine but I'm going to do the I'm
[04:17:57] going to do the archon quest
[04:18:03] anyways got y so I'm telling you it's a
[04:18:06] scam
[04:18:07] I used to be a believer for artifacts
[04:18:09] now I'm a
[04:18:11] doubter didn't we get a HP circl that
[04:18:13] was
[04:18:15] good where is

[04:18:43] okay but I'm never going to use it so
[04:18:46] I'm
[04:18:48] lucky believe in skepticism true that is
[04:18:52] what we that was our
[04:18:58] Fortune okay call it a hunch but I feel
[04:19:01] like this is going to be good on someone
[04:19:02] I just feel okay I feel it you can use
