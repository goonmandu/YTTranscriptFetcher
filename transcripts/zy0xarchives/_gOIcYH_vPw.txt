[00:16:20] need to catch up somehow I didn't claim
[00:16:22] the battle pass yet I didn't get
[00:16:23] anything but I just bought it just to
[00:16:24] have it if anything this proves I'm
[00:16:27] going to play the game which is like a
[00:16:28] win no wouldn't you want me to play
[00:16:31] check mail I
[00:16:34] did yeah I did we leveled our data Bank
[00:16:37] a bit off stream are you sub tweeting me
[00:16:41] did you claim the Gen codes I actually
[00:16:43] forgot you refresh Z you're you're
[00:16:45] excused cuz you're a freeto play who
[00:16:47] refreshes which doesn't even make sense
[00:16:49] but you that's not I was subtweeting
[00:16:51] like whales which isn't even bad you
[00:16:53] know I I've been known to not whale but
[00:16:55] like dolphin you know in my time
[00:17:00] in my
[00:17:13] time yeah we're probably doing the Regis
[00:17:15] Vine event chat uh
[00:17:17] either either tomorrow no either next
[00:17:20] stream which is in two days
[00:17:22] or the stream after
[00:17:25] that but right now I'm kind of addicted
[00:17:27] to Wawa I don't know we we'll probably
[00:17:29] just I'll just see how I
[00:17:34] feel
[00:17:37] waha
[00:17:41] waha HSR today dude if I do the HSR
[00:17:44] Quest it'll take 10 hours what are you
[00:17:45] yapping
[00:17:47] about if you're talking about playing
[00:17:49] the game I'd love to I'm for sure
[00:17:50] playing when boot Hill's
[00:17:52] out but if you're talking about the
[00:17:53] [ __ ] the the 10hour quest okay I can
[00:17:56] say it now [ __ ] Harmony m for me
[00:17:59] isn't even like close to being close to
[00:18:02] remotely close to being optimal for
[00:18:04] booill it's not even close it's
[00:18:05] literally not even in the same
[00:18:06] conversation there's like no benefit at
[00:18:08] all over [ __ ] BR or Ron May it's not
[00:18:12] even like
[00:18:14] feasible
[00:18:17] anyways but I want them like I want the
[00:18:20] character I know I know I know Sask I
[00:18:22] know I want them
[00:18:25] okay just have BR well I have BR so rip
[00:18:28] bow up non bronia
[00:18:32] H is Yuan you like fishal no do you know
[00:18:37] why they're not like ficial because I
[00:18:39] don't really know what they do and
[00:18:41] because I don't really know what they do
[00:18:42] yet that means they're probably not that
[00:18:43] good however I will go over their kit
[00:18:46] okay we're we're learning four stars
[00:18:47] today we're probably not learning him
[00:18:49] though but we are learning four stars
[00:18:50] today
[00:19:09] I don't [ __ ] know Jake that might be
[00:19:10] a skill
[00:19:12] issue yeah I played djon a little well
[00:19:15] okay she's level one caught but like I
[00:19:16] tried her out a little in like the trial
[00:19:18] and [ __ ] she looks fun but I haven't
[00:19:19] like leveled her yet um so I probably
[00:19:21] will I want to level Danon I want to
[00:19:24] level um sonan and I want to level
[00:19:29] uh well mortify but he's already kind of
[00:19:30] leveled also I want to I lowkey want to
[00:19:34] level uh MC
[00:19:36] because no story spoilers but we
[00:19:39] unlocked Havoc so it actually looks
[00:19:52] sick look look let me show you close
[00:19:54] your eyes if you don't want to see but
[00:19:55] like like dude you're going to see it
[00:19:57] anyways
[00:19:59] look at this [ __ ] look at this
[00:20:01] [ __ ] dude it looks so [ __ ] cool what
[00:20:04] the [ __ ] I have a
[00:20:07] wing what the [ __ ] hello my weapon
[00:20:11] turned into a scye
[00:20:14] hello hello this is cooler than like 80%
[00:20:19] of other characters in this game and
[00:20:21] it's it's
[00:20:23] MC like I think okay I love calaro but I
[00:20:26] think these animations on calaro would
[00:20:28] make calaro look cooler she has a wing
[00:20:30] and a
[00:20:37] scythe compare that to genin
[00:20:40] MC
[00:20:42] uh animation wise yes this clears meta
[00:20:45] wise D MC kind of kind of poops on you
[00:20:47] I'm sorry so it's it's a pick your pick
[00:20:49] your poison
[00:20:58] but yeah I think these animations are
[00:21:00] [ __ ] sick like I think they're really
[00:21:02] cool like it actually makes me want to
[00:21:04] play the main character which I think is
[00:21:06] is rare because typically I think main
[00:21:09] characters are often just self-inserts
[00:21:10] so I don't I don't like them that much
[00:21:12] and I don't really care about her design
[00:21:14] but I'm saying I like the animations so
[00:21:16] even her alt well no the AL is kind of
[00:21:17] whatever it's just like a but oh
[00:21:19] actually never mind that was cool
[00:21:25] anyways now so pretty cool I like a lot
[00:21:28] better than the the other what's the
[00:21:31] other one it's spectro and spectro right
[00:21:33] yeah
[00:21:39] spectro how do you get it just do the
[00:21:41] quest you do the main story Quest
[00:21:43] eventually you'll get to a point where
[00:21:44] something happens and then you get
[00:21:48] that can you switch on
[00:21:52] command
[00:21:54] yeah you click here boom
[00:22:09] okay
[00:22:10] D I'm
[00:22:12] sorry do I have any um things I should
[00:22:14] activate wait let's
[00:22:17] see who am I going to play by what does

[00:22:59] about oh she's Havoc wait that's kind of
[00:23:07] fog oh that's
[00:23:09] cool the next character gains 23% Havoc
[00:23:12] damage
[00:23:13] deepen wait I feel like you can play can
[00:23:16] we not play djon with another Havoc can
[00:23:18] we do like Havoc like a Denon with Havoc
[00:23:20] MC thoughts

[00:26:21] we're we're hitting tl30 Plus for sure
[00:26:23] second we're spending all of our wave
[00:26:25] plate third we're getting some e we're
[00:26:27] Echo far trying to level our data Bank
[00:26:29] fourth we just unlocked these we're
[00:26:31] going to do some of them they're kind of
[00:26:33] hard fifth we're probably going to do uh
[00:26:37] either probably we're going to do the
[00:26:39] the simulated Universe whatever it's
[00:26:41] called the like Rog like thing uh we're
[00:26:43] going to do some more of that cuz it's
[00:26:44] fun and we need to unlock the content
[00:26:46] and then
[00:26:48] lastly but also primarily we're going to
[00:26:50] be exploring some places while we
[00:26:52] collect Echoes but we'll we'll do it
[00:26:53] through the exploration Quest cuz you
[00:26:55] like yeah these quests just like force
[00:26:57] you to explore
[00:26:59] like I did I explored uh like some
[00:27:00] Mountain I got like all the way points
[00:27:02] just without doing I did it raw without
[00:27:04] any [ __ ] quests and then when I did A
[00:27:07] world quest after it made me go back to
[00:27:09] the exact like place that I was and just
[00:27:12] backtrack so like you might as well
[00:27:13] [ __ ] world quest
[00:27:16] everything so that that is the what I've
[00:27:19] learned 10-minute
[00:27:21] [Music]
[00:27:27] video you planning to beat the monkeys
[00:27:29] again yes but I didn't want to bring it
[00:27:31] up just in case I fail miserably however
[00:27:33] there are level 100 monkeys that we have
[00:27:35] to fight to get revenge for yesterday
[00:27:37] when I basically killed them but ended
[00:27:39] up not killing them but I did kill them
[00:27:41] I it just didn't
[00:27:48] count switch playlist I mean we're we're
[00:27:50] going to pause the music in like 2
[00:27:51] minutes when the hashtag ad starts so
[00:28:03] uh no Mr Diablo uh I've never played uh
[00:28:06] how do you say that gen genin impact
[00:28:10] I've never played that game but it looks
[00:28:11] fun we might try it someday but now
[00:28:13] we're playing weathering R right now
[00:28:15] it's pretty
[00:28:18] cool I don't know what that game is is
[00:28:20] it new did it just come out
[00:28:28] question mark you have no you might
[00:28:30] maybe you think of another streamer I
[00:28:31] don't know there's a lot of um there's a
[00:28:34] lot of
[00:28:35] streamers you might be confused I don't
[00:28:43] know
[00:28:45] no oh maybe you're thinking I played
[00:28:47] Elden ring you might be thinking of that
[00:28:49] game uh I I'm primarily an Elden ring
[00:28:51] streamer so if you're new here and
[00:28:52] you're a big fan of like you know Elden
[00:28:54] ring and stuff like that's what I
[00:28:55] usually
[00:28:56] play you
[00:29:02] oh did you mean J Shin oh no we actually
[00:29:06] I want her I do want her so the problem
[00:29:08] is I want all the five stars except
[00:29:09] lingyang but I got lingyang so now I can
[00:29:12] uh only get three others does that make
[00:29:14] sense like I got calaro on Gian banner
[00:29:17] and I got lingyang as my like beginner
[00:29:18] one so now I can only choose two others
[00:29:21] so I'm going to have to pick I don't

[00:29:25] not we'll have to see

[00:31:56] hello
[00:31:58] boom boom I'll put this at
[00:32:01] 82
[00:32:07] also for some
[00:32:09] reason we got 20 pills today so uh be

[00:32:30] isn't I don't know feel like that's
[00:32:32] insane though uh oh oh that's what I
[00:32:34] wanted to Doo I know I forgot to say we
[00:32:37] want to we want to we want to level uh
[00:32:39] our this thing whatever it's called
[00:32:41] handbook we want to get it to five I was
[00:32:43] okay the only thing I dude my voice is
[00:32:45] not working today the only thing I
[00:32:47] couldn't do was the impermanent herin we
[00:32:49] couldn't unlock it we just unlocked it
[00:32:51] so I can actually do this now so we need
[00:32:53] to get yeah we need to finish this today
[00:32:56] like ASAP because it gives a lot of XP
[00:32:57] and [ __ ]
[00:32:59] it also gives a five star Echo and
[00:33:03] furthermore furthermore we have a lot of
[00:33:06] stamina to span and we're doing two
[00:33:07] refreshes but don't get mad at me when I
[00:33:08] do like type your Pepe W's now so that
[00:33:11] when I do it you don't type Pepe W does
[00:33:13] that make sense do we understand are we
[00:33:14] on the same page we are okay cool also
[00:33:16] you get uh rewards if you give two subs
[00:33:19] okay I'm done yapping now we can play
[00:33:20] the game uh oh also I waited to start
[00:33:22] stream to claim this
[00:33:27] so we have a
[00:33:29] temple you see how I treat you guys well
[00:33:32] I waited for you you think I didn't want
[00:33:34] to pull I wanted to pull but I waited
[00:33:36] for you I waited for
[00:33:41] you I thought you had a bad throat it's
[00:33:43] not bad it just hurts cuz I've been I've
[00:33:45] been streaming like 12 hours a
[00:33:48] day which isn't even that much for most
[00:33:50] streamers but I'm not most
[00:33:55] streamers anyways
[00:33:59] um we are guaranteed a five star in or
[00:34:02] we're guaranteed Verina in 50
[00:34:05] PS um I genuinely I think I like I think
[00:34:09] I like J chin and I think I like Encore
[00:34:12] more than I like Verina but there's no
[00:34:14] way I'm building three DPSS right now so
[00:34:16] I think we're just going to pull
[00:34:18] verito all right Temple we'll get
[00:34:21] another Temple throughout the stream
[00:34:22] we're at 6 out of 10 so we'll for sure
[00:34:23] get another one
[00:34:29] that's fine yangy W welcome welcome
[00:34:32] yangy we like
[00:34:34] her ooh that's good we're actually
[00:34:37] leveling her today that's good that's
[00:34:39] good we got a copy that's good we're
[00:34:40] leveling her today good Temple I'm happy
[00:34:43] I don't care I'm happy I don't
[00:34:45] care that's fine that's a good
[00:34:48] Temple um we have 20 pulls on this
[00:34:51] Banner but I already have gen so pulling
[00:34:52] would be stupid but I really want
[00:34:54] mortifies though like the four stars on
[00:34:56] this are insane so it's like lowkey
[00:34:58] worth it but it's not worth it like
[00:34:59] building pity isn't worth it but I'm
[00:35:01] also impatient and really want those
[00:35:03] four stars so I don't know what to
[00:35:10] do sorry my phone is like blowing up I
[00:35:13] have post notifications on for like four
[00:35:15] games now I just want to see if there's
[00:35:17] anything important it no it's fine
[00:35:20] okay is there a constellation equivalent
[00:35:22] yes but the thing is I'm not going to
[00:35:24] activate the five star ones so even if I
[00:35:26] got like the C1 of uh or R1 it's called
[00:35:30] I think of GN I wouldn't activate
[00:35:35] it does this game have PVP yes but it's
[00:35:37] between content creators instead of
[00:35:39] being between uh like players so I don't
[00:35:42] know if you can participate depending on
[00:35:43] like what you do I mean you probably
[00:35:45] could you just need a good clickbait
[00:35:46] game that's really what it
[00:35:51] is no I'm kidding there's no there's no
[00:35:53] I don't think this's PVP now
[00:35:57] what Eco level are you listen don't talk
[00:36:00] about it okay I had to sleep today I had
[00:36:02] to go out I've had a life okay I had a
[00:36:05] life okay but we're 27 we have a lot of
[00:36:08] stamina we're going to get 30 plus today
[00:36:10] which is like good that's like a high
[00:36:12] level okay we're getting easy breezy
[00:36:15] beautiful
[00:36:16] today I don't know why I'm just doing
[00:36:18] random [ __ ] right now let me actually
[00:36:19] Focus up Focus up lock in uh exploration
[00:36:22] Quest boom boom boom boom we'll go do
[00:36:26] it base zad what did he say you're awful
[00:36:30] and you should never stream again at Zio
[00:36:32] why would you type base to
[00:36:36] that like like no like I'm just
[00:36:39] wondering
[00:36:41] why did this guy sleep I slept until I
[00:36:44] okay the live stream ended
[00:36:48] at I don't know wait what time did I end
[00:36:51] stream yesterday like 9:00 a.m.
[00:36:57] like okay let's say I ended at 9:00 I
[00:36:59] had to reexport my weathering video and
[00:37:02] then I literally stayed up like an extra
[00:37:04] 2 hours I I went to bed at like 11 cuz I
[00:37:06] was I legit played weaing off stream cuz
[00:37:08] I'm dude I literally like ended my
[00:37:09] weaing stream to go to bed and then I
[00:37:11] played more weathering it's it is what
[00:37:12] it is but um uh uh listen listen it is
[00:37:15] what it is it is what it is addiction it
[00:37:17] is what it is but uh uh uh uh I I went
[00:37:20] to bed like 11:30ish I woke up at 5:30
[00:37:22] so I slept not even that much I slept
[00:37:24] like 6 hours um but it's okay
[00:37:28] okay I'll sleep more
[00:37:38] tonight average life of unemployed
[00:37:40] friends dude I'm literally working
[00:37:44] okay I'm playing my gotcha game this is
[00:37:49] work no I'm I'm kidding but yeah
[00:37:58] how do I build characters in weathering
[00:38:00] you
[00:38:03] uh you you build
[00:38:07] them you pick a
[00:38:10] weapon ideally if you don't know what to
[00:38:13] pick you choose offensive stats you slam
[00:38:16] it on you level it you level your
[00:38:18] character you level their talents
[00:38:20] whatever they're called what are talents
[00:38:21] called in this
[00:38:22] game I'm going to call them talents you
[00:38:24] level your talents abilities I'm going
[00:38:26] to say abilities you your
[00:38:28] abilities skills you level your skills
[00:38:31] and then you equip Echoes now you might
[00:38:32] be like wait what Echoes do I choose you
[00:38:34] choose the ones that give you the
[00:38:35] bonuses of your type or mix and matching
[00:38:38] like two pieces and stuff there's some
[00:38:40] more optimizations as far as like Echo
[00:38:42] costs and like which ones to choose and
[00:38:44] [ __ ] but I I don't want to get into that
[00:38:47] yet cuz I'm still figuring it
[00:38:55] out why you talking like chat GPT cuz I
[00:38:58] wanted to give a a joke answer and say
[00:39:00] you just build them but then I realized
[00:39:02] that it was like a new chatter and then
[00:39:03] they would probably think I'm I'm like
[00:39:04] not helpful and a bad streamer so I was
[00:39:06] like okay I should probably answer but I
[00:39:08] was figuring out my answer as I was
[00:39:09] talking does that make sense does it be
[00:39:16] honest what do you have on your gen
[00:39:18] right now
[00:39:19] oil no I have the just the arrow set
[00:39:22] very simple very standard I just checked
[00:39:24] the arrow set I didn't level my echo yet
[00:39:25] cuz they're they're low uh cost I'm
[00:39:27] waiting for like I have four star Echoes
[00:39:29] but we're not doing anything hard right
[00:39:30] now so I don't need to like we're
[00:39:32] chilling but we're we're we're trying to
[00:39:34] get five star Echoes fast I just have
[00:39:36] the the anyos the what is it called

[01:14:09] levels
[01:14:10] fast uh I'm not going to claim that what
[01:14:12] did I want to
[01:14:13] claim I don't remember probably
[01:14:18] nothing oh yeah wait where's the girl or
[01:14:21] guy I can't remember where you need to
[01:14:23] where you turn in your um the things in

[01:14:32] have a bunch of Quests for that for the
[01:14:34] city I have like 10 to do also I need to
[01:14:36] level four stars today so I think we
[01:14:37] might actually stamina refresh not cuz I
[01:14:39] want to but because I want to level like
[01:14:40] 54 stars does that make sense do you
[01:14:42] understand
[01:14:48] me click top left
[01:15:01] holy [ __ ] there's so
[01:15:11] many POG 63
[01:15:21] asites uh here

[01:15:49] I'm happy cuz for our guide book I mean
[01:15:51] not Data Bank for the guide book we need
[01:15:52] to do that that's good that's one thing
[01:15:55] completed
[01:15:57] boom go up the stairs from the Waypoint
[01:16:00] there are there's ladders not stairs did
[01:16:02] you mean to say
[01:16:13] ladder I feel like it's somewhere over
[01:16:18] here am I
[01:16:21] lying zoom in oh yeah I can just zoom in
[01:16:24] I forgot wait I knew it oh no that's
[01:16:26] Relic
[01:16:27] Merchant wait is that who I'm looking
[01:16:30] for wait it is I knew
[01:16:41] it you guys are actually trying to lead
[01:16:43] me astray and I uh I call you
[01:16:56] I don't know why I plunged
[01:16:59] here Chen P what's up
[01:17:05] man oh wait what the [ __ ] I have a
[01:17:12] quest
[01:17:15] okay how many do I have 24 that's good
[01:17:19] we went from level three
[01:17:21] to level six
[01:17:26] six and I'm
[01:17:27] happy that's a lot of rewards am I six
[01:17:30] I'm six
[01:17:34] cool I got no XP from that
[01:17:41] though is there a particular reason why
[01:17:43] all of your favorite characters seem to
[01:17:44] be men no Kafka is one of my favorite
[01:17:46] characters uh yinlin in weaing waves is
[01:17:49] one of my favorite characters I Danon
[01:17:51] looks cool too okay it's not just I like
[01:17:53] by as well
[01:17:55] it's not just
[01:18:08] men okay I think before we go do the the
[01:18:10] combat stuff we spend some stamina let's
[01:18:13] go kill a Inferno Rider if I ain't
[01:18:18] riding I ain't living unless there's
[01:18:21] someone else I want to send but think we
[01:18:23] send mortify
[01:18:27] dude I don't even like green that much
[01:18:29] it just happens that a lot of the
[01:18:30] characters I like are green but like I'm
[01:18:32] not even like if you like give me 10
[01:18:34] colors green is probably ranking like
[01:18:36] sixth or
[01:18:46] seventh I just went the wrong
[01:18:51] way your favorite Pokemon is green okay
[01:18:53] true okay but I also like like Gengar
[01:18:57] and the Hydra they're not green only
[01:19:00] flyg on
[01:19:02] is Foy Coco's

[01:42:22] supposed to not fall was that the oh wa
[01:42:26] sorry was it supposed to not
[01:42:30] fall do hard yeah I can but like are
[01:42:32] there different chest for difficulty cuz
[01:42:34] that one gave two which implies that
[01:42:35] maybe each of them give
[01:42:38] three cuz like if I get the three CH I
[01:42:40] just want to see I want to see if I get
[01:42:41] another chest I want to see if I get
[01:42:42] another chest let me like uh not [ __ ]
[01:42:46] up each gives two oh okay never mind I
[01:42:50] thought Each G dude most challenges give
[01:42:52] three you I'm right though you can't act
[01:42:53] like I'm wrong the rule of three we
[01:42:55] learned I I learned as a kid that in in
[01:42:58] books there's three there's uh three
[01:43:00] perc like attempts right there's like
[01:43:02] like you'll read a story right the the
[01:43:04] the the prince will try they'll fail
[01:43:06] they'll try again they'll fail and then
[01:43:08] the third attempt they're
[01:43:10] successful it's a rule of
[01:43:13] three or maybe it's three fails and then
[01:43:15] it works but I'm pretty sure yeah
[01:43:17] anyways wait what's the difference of
[01:43:18] this one is it the same thing I'm
[01:43:21] confused this looks the same as
[01:43:25] before did the timer change I don't
[01:43:30] know maybe the box is
[01:43:36] smaller oh the area is
[01:43:38] smaller let me limit to okay never mind
[01:43:40] I was look at chat I got
[01:43:46] it
[01:43:48] [ __ ] G hard
[01:43:53] is it smaller again oh it's a one box
[01:43:56] okay uh so it's probably going to be
[01:43:58] like this oh you got to
[01:44:02] like okay you got to get [ __ ] uh
[01:44:04] feisty with it okay I see okay let's go
[01:44:07] now I got it now I win so you got to
[01:44:10] like go and then you go and then you go
[01:44:14] and then you go and then you go go
[01:44:26] I got
[01:44:32] it do we get
[01:44:36] it
[01:44:38] [ __ ] okay I'm not going to lie I really
[01:44:40] don't want to start any drama I don't
[01:44:42] want to like flame anyone but I thought

[01:59:24] better I try
[01:59:25] to
[01:59:35] sorry yeah he's good he gets a lot
[01:59:37] better with his fourth uh R his fourth
[01:59:41] copy well fifth copy I guess
[01:59:50] C4 okay I got the weapons leveled boom
[01:59:53] what else do I need resonators to level
[01:59:55] 50 okay well mortify it's your [ __ ]
[01:59:57] time to shine buddy although granted I'm
[02:00:00] probably going to get a Verina and
[02:00:02] another five star that I'm going to
[02:00:03] level and I want to level some other
[02:00:04] four stars like dungeon and sanoa and
[02:00:12] uh whatever I mean I already ascended
[02:00:14] them [ __ ]
[02:00:18] it don't understand why people are
[02:00:20] swearing by him he literally has B alt
[02:00:23] permanent off field like per off field
[02:00:25] damage with insanely good up time when
[02:00:27] you get his C4 without it he's kind of
[02:00:29] what like he's still good but he's kind
[02:00:30] of whatever if you get this it's
[02:00:31] literally 17c up time which is [ __ ]
[02:00:33] stupid additionally he has the outro
[02:00:35] skill of a [ __ ] uh I almost said
[02:00:37] something that would get me banned not
[02:00:39] really but I don't want to say during a
[02:00:40] sponsor segment he has an outro skill of
[02:00:42] a demon which is literally uh a heavy
[02:00:45] attack damage B for 14 seconds which
[02:00:46] synergizes incredibly well with a
[02:00:48] character known as GN who heavy attacks
[02:00:51] the whole time in his
[02:00:56] anyways pretty
[02:00:58] good pretty
[02:01:13] good okay what's the other ones five
[02:01:16] Echoes two skills of two resonators to
[02:01:18] level three okay we'll do that with uh
[02:01:20] Karo we'll get get his Al to three and
[02:01:23] we'll
[02:01:28] get probably
[02:01:33] this
[02:01:42] yes actual skill deals damage too yeah
[02:01:44] it does quite a bit he also has two e
[02:01:46] with his like Liberation which is pretty
[02:01:48] good um I think tune five Echoes Don't
[02:01:53] Mind If I Do brother don't mind if I do
[02:01:56] uh sure I mean to be tuned
[02:02:01] okay oh wait that is that it's a
[02:02:03] different Echo though I need to do a
[02:02:04] different Echo oopsies I wasted
[02:02:07] one
[02:02:10] uh do I have an echo that I actually
[02:02:12] want to keep for a while I mean Havoc
[02:02:14] damage on attack four star this actually
[02:02:16] pretty good I'm going to lock it this is
[02:02:18] actually good wait let me put on a Havoc
[02:02:20] character I mean granted I'm not really
[02:02:22] playing Havoc right
[02:02:23] now wait no I'm actually going to play
[02:02:25] Havoc very shortly I'll put on uh wait I
[02:02:28] just deleted someone's message how the
[02:02:30] [ __ ] did I I'm sorry I'm I'm

[02:02:57] he n i'
[02:03:01] tune
[02:03:03] HP that's fine all right claim that's 7
[02:03:07] out of 10 five Echoes defeat the thing
[02:03:10] that's combat defeat the thing that's
[02:03:11] combat we can do those that's fun we
[02:03:13] need to level five Echoes now the
[02:03:14] problem with leveling five Echoes is
[02:03:16] that I don't want to the not problem is
[02:03:18] that I also don't want to um
[02:03:26] um I mean I do have some better Echoes
[02:03:28] right now it's fine it's probably worth
[02:03:36] doing your favorite
[02:03:39] character it won't let me zoom in but
[02:03:41] this
[02:03:47] guy uh okay let me go do
[02:03:52] we have to do the weekly challenge
[02:03:54] right let's do the weekly
[02:04:03] challenge but before we do should I
[02:04:06] level five Echo maybe maybe I should
[02:04:08] plus 15 is a pretty high
[02:04:11] ask plus 15 is quite a
[02:04:20] bit boom
[02:04:25] is this one good Electra okay never mind
[02:04:28] uh never mind
[02:04:30] um uh I mean this one's already 10 we
[02:04:33] might as well get a 15
[02:04:36] true sub attribute
[02:04:40] slot

[02:05:20] you
[02:05:22] me yeah you oh my God me
[02:05:30] sorry I need to level two more
[02:05:32] pieces three stars are the cheapest
[02:05:35] however the four star we have the the
[02:05:37] spectral or not the the other one is
[02:05:39] actually really
[02:05:45] good crit damage attack on an ER set
[02:05:57] Chad Chad be honest with me be honest
[02:05:58] with me be honest with me thoughts on
[02:06:00] leveling this piece my only concern
[02:06:10] is I have a few concerns one I don't
[02:06:12] know how much I'm going to play spectral
[02:06:13] character although I do like dungeon and
[02:06:15] two if I do I don't know if I'm going to
[02:06:16] even go to the twopiece attack but it
[02:06:18] does seem
[02:06:19] fine attack is like versatile it's not
[02:06:22] like like it's
[02:06:23] [Music]
[02:06:26] fine but it's cheaper to level a three
[02:06:28] star is the only
[02:06:30] thing wait I have that what the [ __ ]
[02:06:33] wait wait
[02:06:34] wait oh but I already have that thing
[02:06:36] equipped here never
[02:06:45] mind attack on attack
[02:06:52] Vina is spectro wait really she's green
[02:06:55] why would she be spectro well I don't
[02:06:57] even know what path Vina is or element
[02:06:58] or
[02:07:01] type I thought green was like green
[02:07:12] type
[02:07:16] plant she spectro I see
[02:07:22] [Music]
[02:07:24] death these are
[02:07:26] terrible okay let me stop stalling let
[02:07:28] me stop stalling uh wrong one wrong one
[02:07:30] where's the good
[02:07:35] one okay we'll get it
[02:07:41] to we'll get it to
[02:07:46] 10 please please please please oh my I
[02:07:49] mean that's actually good that's
[02:07:50] actually good that's it's actually
[02:08:00] fine okay the problem with this is If I

[02:08:46] she
[02:08:48] is uh well
[02:08:50] whatever so I don't want to do my weekly
[02:08:52] challenges until I reach Soul three

[02:08:56] three phase 4 I'm
[02:09:02] gonna like I I can't do this page of the

[02:09:09] of the handbook but I'm not going to
[02:09:10] wait till 30 before finishing my

[02:15:54] ready hello
[02:15:57] hello okay I I suck at the game it's
[02:16:00] fine why is his attack so slow
[02:16:03] though like this guy this boss sucks his
[02:16:06] [ __ ] animations are
[02:16:07] like like look at how much he stalls
[02:16:09] between when he starts animation and
[02:16:10] when he hits me look look look look look
[02:16:12] look
[02:16:14] look I mean I won't get hit so it's fine
[02:16:18] but I don't know what this attack does
[02:16:31] F oh I didn't break him F I broke
[02:16:36] him I miss my e though that's fine he's
[02:16:41] dead mortify buff we actually got it
[02:16:54] easy
[02:16:56] easy crit

[02:17:19] [Music]
[02:17:24] I'm
[02:17:38] gaming oh I pressed my echo at the wrong
[02:17:47] time probably should R before e but it's
[02:17:50] fine
[02:17:58] what the [ __ ] I couldn't see him he
[02:18:00] [ __ ] okay was that my fault though I
[02:18:03] couldn't see him like like like was it
[02:18:04] why can't I leave oh
[02:18:09] P I could have locked on but I don't

[02:18:47] we can beat it we can beat it
[02:18:50] [Applause]
[02:18:53] I also don't have my burst ready this
[02:18:58] time okay no we're learning the
[02:19:02] mechanics oh that's a weird attack
[02:19:05] timing I'm not really used to
[02:19:08] it does he attack me again here no okay
[02:19:22] no I don't know if I was going to get
[02:19:24] hit or not but I

[02:22:37] loser okay that one was that one was
[02:22:40] that was that one on me yes it was no it

[02:22:50] okay okay run back run
[02:22:53] back all right we do
[02:22:55] this try to get some energy
[02:23:01] here oh this attack is slow okay I said
[02:23:03] it though I said this attack is slow I
[02:23:05] dodged he was slower than I thought did
[02:23:07] you hear that I said it was a slow
[02:23:09] attack but it was so slow that my slow
[02:23:12] read was still too
[02:23:15] fast okay patience patience deep breath
[02:23:17] deep breath deep breath okay we're good
[02:23:20] wait why was he going as I paused the
[02:23:29] [Music]
[02:23:36] game what is he doing is this the suck
[02:23:41] attack whatever I'm not going to [ __ ]
[02:23:43] with him
[02:23:51] I'll I'll Parry it I'll Parry
[02:24:02] it oh I pressed E I thought I would get
[02:24:05] out his
[02:24:09] way I thought I thought ah I thought I
[02:24:12] thought I would ah that was dumb I
[02:24:13] should have just queued cuz I was
[02:24:15] thinking my head I'm like should I Al
[02:24:17] here like would I die if I don't Al I
[02:24:19] was like no I could just eat but it was
[02:24:21] not good q q q
[02:24:24] swap that attack is so slow it throws me
[02:24:27] off it's
[02:24:30] fine okay that attack is also it is what
[02:24:33] it
[02:24:34] is okay to be fair though if I'm being
[02:24:36] honest calaro is useless but it won't
[02:24:38] let me change my I forgot like I can't
[02:24:40] form a team like what do you want me to
[02:24:41] do what do you want me to oh wait I can
[02:24:43] you are knocked out [ __ ] you calaro but
[02:24:45] I don't have okay by doesn't do anything
[02:24:48] and I don't have anyone else that does
[02:24:49] anything I mean I do but like I'm not
[02:24:50] going to level
[02:24:52] them like mortify good Jan good this guy
[02:24:56] doesn't buff me at all she gives one
[02:25:00] buff how much is it I mean 15% is not
[02:25:03] bad but the healing doesn't do
[02:25:10] anything by you heals healing does
[02:25:12] literally nothing if you get one shot
[02:25:25] okay one
[02:25:30] second
[02:25:35] um should I give this guy damage like
[02:25:37] should I actually level
[02:25:47] him that was unlucky
[02:25:56] oh we got we got the first last time
[02:26:01] chatter rare emote
[02:26:07] usage okay CCH is definitely bench right
[02:26:09] like there's no way we're playing two
[02:26:10] DPSS but I don't think by does anything
[02:26:13] I'm being honest I'm being honest I'm
[02:26:14] being
[02:26:19] honest
[02:26:29] for like there's no benefit I mean it
[02:26:32] doesn't matter if she's dead like I
[02:26:33] literally don't think it matters cuz she
[02:26:35] does literally nothing like our third
[02:26:37] character even calaro like what did he
[02:26:41] do I guess energy right but like does
[02:26:43] Karo generate a lot Maybe
[02:27:09] we're definitely undergeared though to
[02:27:10] be fair but it's
[02:27:12] okay h
[02:27:34] no give me my thing I got
[02:27:39] it I didn't get my altim time
[02:27:45] unlucky what is that attack I don't know
[02:27:47] what this attack does I haven't seen
[02:27:49] this attack before
[02:27:55] oh I tried to
[02:27:57] attack wait I got it wait I parried him
[02:27:59] but I died hello question hello if I
[02:28:02] Parry him but I die how does that make
[02:28:04] sense hello I pared it hello how did I
[02:28:07] die
[02:28:09] hello hello I parried it I timed it
[02:28:13] correctly that I
[02:28:16] not anyways we're definitely
[02:28:18] undergeared cuz you usually people like
[02:28:21] every streamer I've watched do it like
[02:28:22] plus 15 is every Echo unless you're like
[02:28:24] a turbo gamer but I'm not a turbo gamer
[02:28:26] I mean I I still think we could do it
[02:28:28] okay by G D I need a third character
[02:28:41] dude I mean maybe it's just Karo I don't
[02:28:45] know I use Jan Shin
[02:28:49] yeah that'd be cool if I had
[02:28:54] her it'd be cool if I had
[02:29:08] her oh that's uh I forgot was that I'm
[02:29:11] not dead it's fine I forgot what that
[02:29:13] attack was chill chill chill chill
[02:29:16] chill I'll just use calaro till uh I
[02:29:18] [ __ ] up
[02:29:22] cuz he gives me energy for my G when I
[02:29:24] swap into
[02:29:29] him okay wait let me actually try to
[02:29:31] Parry this is he going to do it again no
[02:29:33] he's
[02:29:43] not I think this Echo is not the best
[02:29:45] one oh oops oopsies
[02:29:51] [ __ ] I missed wait wait do it again do
[02:29:53] it again let me par you do it again do
[02:29:54] it again okay he didn't do it
[02:30:00] again o that [ __ ] hit
[02:30:03] me okay my fault we'll come back when
[02:30:05] we're leveled you know what fine fine
[02:30:06] fine it's okay it's okay I'll come back
[02:30:08] in a bit let me let me level first let
[02:30:11] me level first give me a second first of
[02:30:13] all we cleared this page which means we
[02:30:14] get a five star Echo if this is crit
[02:30:17] I'll be happy if it's any damage bonus
[02:30:20] that's not good I'll be sad if it's
[02:30:21] Arrow I'll be happy if it's Electro I'll
[02:30:23] be
[02:30:24] happy actually I wait it's Fusion on
[02:30:29] attack that's actually good I
[02:30:41] mean it's good if I get [ __ ] uh the
[02:30:44] voices it's good if I get puppet
[02:30:46] girl encore
[02:31:02] that's actually
[02:31:03] good it's on a attack set though
[02:31:14] but she's Fusion right I'm not going to
[02:31:16] get
[02:31:17] confused yeah yeah Fusion
[02:31:22] I mean we take those we take
[02:31:27] those yeah I'm pretty sure I I could
[02:31:29] beat it like if I plus 15 all my [ __ ]
[02:31:31] but like I dude I don't think it's worth
[02:31:32] the resources like look like this is dog
[02:31:34] [ __ ] it's plus zero useless this one is
[02:31:37] leveled this one is a two star that does
[02:31:39] nothing this one is pretty [ __ ]
[02:31:40] useless too like but I don't feel like
[02:31:42] I'm not going to like mid Max fourar
[02:31:44] Echoes just to get one five star Echo I
[02:31:46] feel like I should wait
[02:31:50] why is your standard High cuz it's a
[02:31:51] waste of resources like I could I don't
[02:31:54] know maybe it's better content if I just
[02:31:55] level [ __ ] and then clear but I feel
[02:31:58] like it's just more efficient if I wait
[02:32:00] till I have good pieces and level the
[02:32:01] good pieces instead of just leveling dog
[02:32:03] [ __ ] and then throwing them into good
[02:32:04] things but I'm not I don't know maybe
[02:32:07] I'll change my
[02:32:10] mind okay okay new goal we clear we
[02:32:13] clear that before three bands for sure
[02:32:15] new goal but I just I want to see if I
[02:32:17] get better Echoes before I I forced
[02:32:20] myself to kill it like like we'll wait
[02:32:22] till I get better Echo cuz I'm about to
[02:32:24] level up
[02:32:29] anyways 50 no we beat the 51 you had
[02:32:32] five star soon yeah we're like right
[02:32:33] around the corner we're uh dat Bank 12
[02:32:36] or 13 yeah we're almost 13 we get at uh
[02:32:38] 50 so like we're honestly we could do it
[02:32:40] this stream if I game but I need to game
[02:32:42] chat you guys need to game too it's just
[02:32:44] it's more fun to do content when it's
[02:32:45] hard like but I also don't want to grief
[02:32:48] myself and do it with like one Echo so
[02:32:49] I'm going to wait a little also there's
[02:32:51] a chance that we get Verina by the time
[02:32:53] we get there cuz we're get more pulls
[02:32:54] we're 10 pulls off and then we're 40
[02:32:56] guaranteed and and no that's it actually

[02:43:15] it's pretty good it's like sometimes
[02:43:17] like climbing some stuff will be
[02:43:18] annoying but usually
[02:43:20] like when the movement works well it's
[02:43:21] really
[02:43:35] smooth I don't like the I need to change
[02:43:37] my sensitivity like the in-game one wait
[02:43:40] where's the last one hello hello yo
[02:43:43] where's

[02:43:56] it okay this sensitivity is I'm sorry
[02:43:58] one second it's like so fast
[02:44:02] uh
[02:44:09] aiming wait why is this faster
[02:44:22] I got
[02:44:27] it wait can I just not see
[02:44:38] it valerin player first of all I haven't
[02:44:40] had time to play in Forever second of
[02:44:42] all it it like I can't like import my
[02:44:44] sensitivity dude it's a gotcha game what
[02:44:46] do you want me to
[02:44:48] do oh [ __ ] this thing my
[02:44:55] eye you die in any decent FPS 1 V one
[02:44:58] with that low of a sense you are coping
[02:45:00] you don't you clearly don't know how FPS
[02:45:02] games work every [ __ ] Pro runs on
[02:45:03] like negative five cents and they can't
[02:45:05] even like move their Mouse on their
[02:45:06] desktop they have to use their whole
[02:45:07] mouse pad cuz they aim with their arm
[02:45:09] cuz it's way more precise was literally
[02:45:11] half the best players can't even do a
[02:45:12] 180 on their mouse pad but it doesn't
[02:45:14] matter cuz they [ __ ] place their
[02:45:15] Crosshair on a head if anything I'm like
[02:45:18] way higher sense than most people I my
[02:45:21] base DPI is,
[02:45:24] 1600 also know plays on high sense yeah
[02:45:26] my sense is literally his like it's the
[02:45:28] exact
[02:45:32] same but that's also an exception like
[02:45:34] most of the most people
[02:45:37] don't but also when I watch him like I
[02:45:40] feel like he like chugs a coffee and
[02:45:41] takes four Adderalls before every game I
[02:45:44] can't tell I don't know if it's true or
[02:45:46] not but it looks like it
[02:45:52] true rice that's what I'm
[02:46:01] saying what the [ __ ] is this
[02:46:13] song, 1600 is that one number I'm
[02:46:15] allergic to because of that one exam
[02:46:17] wait what do you mean well you wrot WX
[02:46:19] am but I don't that's exam why did I
[02:46:21] just get a first time chatter that said

[02:46:42] true drink water I will one second talk
[02:46:46] to siron
[02:46:59] what do character elements do in this
[02:47:05] game they look cool
[02:47:24] there's some synergies though among
[02:47:26] characters like it'll be like oh you I'm
[02:47:29] Electro and the next Electro character
[02:47:31] you go to gains Electro damage if they

[02:47:51] how is that leakers it's literally a
[02:47:53] character that's available in
[02:48:00] game also the only reason I always use
[02:48:02] Electro as an example is cuz it's it's
[02:48:04] the only like element that I know the
[02:48:05] name of like it Electro's consistent
[02:48:08] across both
[02:48:10] games I'm not trying to say [ __ ]

[02:53:09] finale yeah so you just want resolve
[02:53:11] when you press it and then it does more

[02:53:13] need 30
[02:53:14] resolve and you can hold 60 so that
[02:53:16] means you want half your bar full

[03:21:30] my vaud my uh the the live stream had
[03:21:34] the monetization off like it was like I
[03:21:37] was ineligible because of the [ __ ]
[03:21:39] copyrighted song M business M
[03:21:44] business I mean it doesn't matter
[03:21:47] but
[03:21:49] M minus one sponsor no I love them it's
[03:21:52] a great game I love working with them
[03:21:53] I'm just saying I'm just saying it was
[03:21:55] like uh to license the music in the
[03:21:56] future it's no big deal it's no big deal
[03:21:58] live and learn live and learn the devs
[03:22:00] Care About Us for once I feel
[03:22:03] appreciated it's a good thing no it's
[03:22:05] it's a w like okay the Act was but like
[03:22:07] it like like like you know they were
[03:22:09] like oh [ __ ] there's bugs on release
[03:22:11] sorry here's my entire [ __ ] bank
[03:22:13] account I'm like okay I didn't need all
[03:22:15] this but thank you like I I you could
[03:22:17] have gave a 10 pull I would have been
[03:22:18] happy instead I got 20 and a five star
[03:22:20] and I think we got standard pulls too
[03:22:22] okay thank you thank you thank you
[03:22:48] [Music]
[03:23:04] con are nice but money isn't everything
[03:23:06] when I can barely Run the game yeah I
[03:23:07] mean we know they're working on it like
[03:23:09] it it
[03:23:10] sucks that that's a thing like it's it's
[03:23:14] definitely an issue
[03:23:18] but
[03:23:21] um at least they're like trying to be
[03:23:24] like sorry we're fixing it so hopefully
[03:23:26] it it gets
[03:23:27] better it's like in okay in my
[03:23:29] experience this was I was thinking about
[03:23:31] this a bit off stream I think it's like
[03:23:34] really bad like um it's a it's a bad
[03:23:37] look if day one there's issues stopping
[03:23:39] like for them because it means potential
[03:23:41] players might not want to play if it
[03:23:42] doesn't work however if they fix things
[03:23:45] and they're working on fixing it it then
[03:23:46] it becomes a net positive for the people
[03:23:48] that play because now you get a free
[03:23:50] Five Star so like even if you can't play
[03:23:52] for 3 days would you rather have like a
[03:23:55] free Five Star in three days of no
[03:23:56] playing probably like if I have the
[03:23:59] choice of don't like get play the game
[03:24:01] for three days and don't get a five star
[03:24:02] or wait 3 days and get a five star I'd

[03:24:08] it sucks and it sucks for them in
[03:24:11] particular because it means like a lot

[03:27:13] side quests and stuff honestly
[03:27:17] you get a big chunk of XP from just
[03:27:18] [ __ ] exploring and unlocking
[03:27:20] everything like with exploration Quest
[03:27:21] World quest or just like [ __ ] your quest
[03:27:23] just like explore but a lot of like XP
[03:27:25] is just free from dailies like you do
[03:27:27] daily Quest and you do resin or
[03:27:30] stamina like that's why a lot of like
[03:27:32] the not necessarily whale but like full
[03:27:35] stamina refreshing streamers will be
[03:27:37] like higher TL even if you play the game
[03:27:40] more just cuz they have more [ __ ] or
[03:27:41] not stream like players will have more
[03:27:43] like things to spend
[03:27:51] pep I'm not talking about me bro I've
[03:27:53] never done more than two and you can do
[03:27:55] six a day I've only done
[03:28:01] two that is on another level dude I
[03:28:03] actually said I was going to play that
[03:28:04] what
[03:28:06] happened and the only reason I might
[03:28:09] refresh I haven't yet I haven't the only
[03:28:10] reason I might is to level four stars to
[03:28:13] test if I want to make content you get
[03:28:15] me I just got a four star pog
[03:28:18] boom see I just leveled D
[03:28:27] in I still don't have a weapon
[03:28:31] though you going to finish the story
[03:28:33] before 2.2 I already finished the main
[03:28:34] quest well like as much as I can do
[03:28:36] right now I don't know if I'm going to
[03:28:37] get
[03:28:38] more
[03:28:40] probably we
[03:28:47] let's
[03:28:50] go bring out the whole ocean sorry let's
[03:28:53] go fight a boss I think let's go fight a
[03:28:54] boss I think let's go fight a boss I
[03:28:56] think let's go fight a boss I plink what
[03:28:59] if I level my D in past 40 I mean I
[03:29:00] should at least see if she's fun First
[03:29:02] Auto equip I don't want Auto equip [ __ ]
[03:29:05] it I want Auto equip
[03:29:09] um she's Havoc
[03:29:11] right yes but this is a molten set XD
[03:29:23] this is
[03:29:25] good and then we can run twopiece
[03:29:37] Havoc I mean this is better
[03:29:59] fine increase the Creator's Havoc damage
[03:30:01] so I probably want this one as my active
[03:30:03] Echo right so I do like
[03:30:21] Rose shroom wait what does rosom
[03:30:29] do
[03:30:32] oh nah I'm
[03:30:36] crownless I mean to be fair I usually
[03:30:38] swap cancel it so I don't know if the
[03:30:40] Havoc damage actually matters but it
[03:30:41] lasts for 15 and assuming it doesn't
[03:30:44] [ __ ] up when you swap I just swap back
[03:30:46] into her and it should be fine but I
[03:30:48] mean I could see this being good too cuz
[03:30:50] it scales on your wait is this a flat
[03:30:52] wait dealing
[03:30:54] 29% of what like your
[03:31:01] attack wait no show me what
[03:31:09] it I assume it skills on your
[03:31:13] attack the non yeah maybe the the other
[03:31:15] one wait where's the other
[03:31:17] one I
[03:31:19] mean again thises is just skill in your
[03:31:21] attack I guess it just skills in your
[03:31:22] attack that's an 150% scaling is that
[03:31:35] good I feel like her scalings are high
[03:31:38] enough to where Havoc damage bonus is
[03:31:40] better I could I mean I guess early game
[03:31:42] damage is better but I feel like her
[03:31:44] scalings are pretty high 15 50 scaling
[03:31:46] wait is it I don't know I I'll figure it
[03:31:48] out later whatever I do want to play her
[03:31:50] though I can't switch sad wait where was
[03:31:53] I going where the [ __ ] was I

[03:46:31] good what the [ __ ] are these turtles
[03:46:33] doing
[03:46:48] I got J in the free three PS
[03:46:50] POG
[03:46:53] mods mods please send them a strongly
[03:46:56] worded letter thank you thank
[03:47:04] you how do you feel about the game so
[03:47:06] far oh it's all coming out now
[03:47:12] [Music]
[03:47:15] it's pretty cool I'm enjoying the combat
[03:47:16] exploring is fun that's all thanks for
[03:47:25] watching there's some uh you know
[03:47:31] but like I'm not a big fan of like like
[03:47:35] I'm just Autos skipping the story cuz I
[03:47:36] kind of like you know whatever
[03:47:40] but I think it depends what type of
[03:47:42] player you are like I was talking to to
[03:47:44] to Fang earlier and I was like cuz she's
[03:47:48] in Thailand she's like oh D I wish I
[03:47:49] could stream like weathering waves and
[03:47:50] I'm like yeah like you can after but I'm
[03:47:53] also like I feel like what I like in
[03:47:56] this game is like the combat and stuff
[03:47:58] and like she's more of a like story
[03:48:01] player than a combat player so I think
[03:48:03] some people will enjoy the game more
[03:48:04] than like some I don't know I mean you
[03:48:06] might like the story you might not
[03:48:08] personally I like the combat I kind of
[03:48:09] don't care about the story that's just
[03:48:11] me though
[03:48:15] so it can depend what type of player you
[03:48:22] are skipping and then saying as bad
[03:48:24] after not reading a word okay I read the
[03:48:27] CBT to story and I did a uh it just it's
[03:48:30] not I don't think it's bad I think it's
[03:48:32] very dumpy of information sometimes um
[03:48:37] months which I think other games that
[03:48:40] have good story are guilty of as well
[03:48:42] especially because the more the the
[03:48:44] longer your game's
[03:48:46] lifespan uh the longer your game's
[03:48:48] lifespan and the more you like the more
[03:48:52] people play the bigger budget you have
[03:48:53] the more you optimize your like team and
[03:48:55] your [ __ ] like everything and then
[03:48:57] story gets better it's like
[03:49:00] 1.0 is always going to be worse than
[03:49:02] like 3.0 like if if weaing wave succeeds
[03:49:05] and a lot of people play it they'll have
[03:49:06] a bigger budget they'll be able to you
[03:49:08] know this that this that this that and
[03:49:09] it'll get better like it'll get even
[03:49:11] better in the ways that are already good
[03:49:13] or better in the ways that are lacking
[03:49:15] with like it's like about every game
[03:49:16] like I
[03:49:19] think both genin and Star's story got
[03:49:22] progressively
[03:49:23] better granted I think I don't know like
[03:49:26] maybe I'm misremembering but like
[03:49:31] [Music]
[03:49:33] 1.0 I feel like I've seen a lot of like
[03:49:36] people on Twitter shitalking like gen
[03:49:38] 1.0 but I I felt engaged by like doing
[03:49:42] monat but maybe that's just cuz it was a
[03:49:44] new game like a novel like I didn't
[03:49:46] replay
[03:49:48] it but I'm also feeling very engaged
[03:49:50] doing waa 1.0 like I feel like I'm
[03:49:52] enjoying this a lot I just I'm enjoying
[03:49:54] the combat and exploring more than just
[03:49:56] like I want a quest but I also I didn't
[03:49:59] I was not a [ __ ] like Quest head in
[03:50:01] genin like I was like
[03:50:04] whatever Ena Zuma okay yeah inauma we
[03:50:07] don't talk about that
[03:50:17] yeah we don't talk about okay to be fair
[03:50:19] though Inazuma started really
[03:50:25] strong I think inuma started really
[03:50:27] strong and then it was kind of just like
[03:50:29] I don't know what happened and then I
[03:50:31] mean sumaru sumaru was [ __ ]
[03:50:36] lit I like Duma it's I think inuma is
[03:50:39] the most popular region it's just like
[03:50:42] you'll you'll see me bashing on it not
[03:50:45] cuz I don't like it I love the character
[03:50:46] design and I think it's pretty but I
[03:50:48] think a lot of the like every time I was
[03:50:50] doing the archon quest I was like why is
[03:50:52] it going in this direction but like it's
[03:50:54] also been a while so I don't remember
[03:50:56] everything so I could be I could be
[03:50:57] yapping
[03:51:33] but yeah like I I yeah like for example
[03:51:36] Ling Yang's Quest I think for people
[03:51:39] that like lingyang was pretty good at
[03:51:40] selling him at the end cuz he was like
[03:51:42] okay I'm like the only like jingle Beast
[03:51:44] remaining and like it's me I want to
[03:51:45] like I started on four legs I learned to
[03:51:47] stand up and like I want to be a real
[03:51:49] human and accepted and like it like made
[03:51:50] me like him but the first like hour I
[03:51:52] was doing it I was
[03:51:54] like I kind of don't care but then at
[03:51:56] the end I was like okay cool spoilers
[03:51:58] it's a random side quest okay I'm sorry
[03:52:01] I'm sorry I'm sorry I did it on stream
[03:52:03] it's not like I did it off
[03:52:07] stream but the gameplay in the quest was
[03:52:09] fun for me like I enjoyed the like 2D
[03:52:11] thing the like platforming like I I had
[03:52:13] fun but I was like the dialogue I was
[03:52:15] like I don't care like I did it in cbt2
[03:52:17] I like read it well I read it I didn't
[03:52:19] read on stream actually I read it on
[03:52:20] cbt2 but yeah I don't
[03:52:36] know I I I I I I am sorry I'm sorry my t
[03:52:41] button wasn't working it was on cool
[03:52:42] down I misclicked I I was like why am I
[03:52:56] not okay well since I already spoiled it
[03:52:58] I'm going to keep talking it's like it
[03:53:00] also was like at the end I was like he
[03:53:01] was kind of like hinting that there's
[03:53:02] only one left I was like oh it's him and
[03:53:04] then right after I was thinking that he
[03:53:05] was like yeah actually it's me like he
[03:53:08] didn't like say it but he like kept
[03:53:09] yapping about like it's like could have
[03:53:11] just given us like the oh [ __ ] I know
[03:53:13] but then it kind of like going to be
[03:53:15] like yo it's it's me bro like you're
[03:53:16] [ __ ]
[03:53:26] stupid but I enjoyed it like I enjoyed
[03:53:28] the the last like talking tilling gang I
[03:53:30] think it was
[03:53:31] good or rather I don't know how to
[03:53:33] describe what I'm thinking
[03:53:41] anyways I didn't do the other character
[03:53:43] story Quest though I did g
[03:53:45] I did gn's
[03:53:48] um and I did Ling yangs I didn't do the
[03:53:51] any other character story Quest so I
[03:53:53] don't
[03:53:57] know I think the last Quest I won't
[03:53:59] spoil this one the last main story Quest
[03:54:01] I did where I where you unlock something
[03:54:04] uh I I enjoyed doing it it was pretty
[03:54:07] good like I okay granted for that one
[03:54:09] look it was off stream so I may not have
[03:54:12] read everything hey C okay I'm onon it
[03:54:14] man I may have pressed you know space
[03:54:16] bar but it was like a battlefield I was
[03:54:18] like fighting [ __ ] it was it was
[03:54:20] engaging it was
[03:54:26] engaging you know that one was a bit of
[03:54:28] a l Skipper moment I'm not going to lie
[03:54:30] I'm not going to
[03:54:35] [Music]
[03:54:38] lie but like okay star for example I was
[03:54:41] a lore Skipper at the start penan I've
[03:54:43] enjoyed every second of you know I did
[03:54:45] 2.2 the second it came out okay but
[03:54:48] unironically I did 2.0 2.1 I read it I
[03:54:50] was like engaged I liked it but 1.0 I
[03:54:53] don't think I oh no I did I did pay
[03:54:54] attention to 1.0 but then like sanjo
[03:54:56] lofu after [ __ ] Ting Yun I stopped
[03:54:58] paying attention I don't think it was
[03:55:00] bad I just never did the other quests I
[03:55:02] don't know why
[03:55:21] can I not
[03:55:22] [Music]
[03:55:29] C
[03:55:32] we Tic
[03:55:39] Tac okay I really want to level my
[03:55:41] dungeons weapon but I don't have a
[03:55:42] fourar one which means the only thing
[03:55:44] realistically realistically the only
[03:55:46] thing I can do is build pity on GN
[03:55:47] banner and pull like like I don't want
[03:55:49] to pull but I'm forced to pull like I
[03:55:50] don't want to I don't even want like I
[03:55:52] don't want
[03:55:53] to I'm sorry okay no five star we just
[03:55:56] get a four star we dip cuz mortify or
[03:55:58] dude the four stars are so [ __ ] good
[03:56:00] anyone except chisha and it's amazing
[03:56:02] but the problem is I keep getting chisha
[03:56:04] the only four stars I've gotten multiple
[03:56:06] of on this Banner are chisha or is I
[03:56:09] just keep getting
[03:56:11] her like no dis disrespect to her I just
[03:56:15] oh I have a four-star weapon
[03:56:17] selector I forgot and I bought the
[03:56:19] battle pass okay my fault it's fine we
[03:56:21] got a fourstar please please mortify
[03:56:22] please mortify please
[03:56:28] mortify it's fine we play her it's fine
[03:56:30] it's fine it's fine it's fine it's
[03:56:36] fine what does this
[03:56:38] do wow increases her Max HP let's go
[03:56:46] don't just I know I like her I just
[03:56:47] don't want her [ __ ]
[03:56:49] constellation cuz I'd rather dude I
[03:56:51] honestly think it's unless they release
[03:56:54] a new four star it is impossible for the
[03:56:56] four star of the next Banner to be
[03:56:58] better than these there's literally two
[03:57:00] insane
[03:57:03] characters it's actually like impossible
[03:57:05] so like it's building pity is always a
[03:57:08] trap if you don't want the five star but
[03:57:09] like if you don't get the five star it's
[03:57:11] smart and like look I kind of want
[03:57:21] wait what the [ __ ] I'm taking damage bro
[03:57:26] I okay

[04:05:44] Mark thanks for Prime secret cat thanks
[04:05:46] for
[04:05:52] Prime I was building pity and got Gian
[04:05:54] brother like like did you not learn from
[04:05:56] like every other gacha game
[04:05:59] ever understandable though dungeon and
[04:06:01] mortify like it's worth it Jen is
[04:06:04] lit but I I'm using the arrow set on him
[04:06:07] I'm just like straightforward Arrow [ __ ]
[04:06:13] I dodged I I I I I okay but I have no
[04:06:15] healer like is it my fault I have no
[04:06:17] healer on my team it's not my fault it's
[04:06:19] not my
[04:06:20] fault it's bound to happen bound to fall
[04:06:24] in
[04:06:30] love wait I forgot what these things
[04:06:32] were like now I know what they are but I
[04:06:33] forgot I should be doing these These are
[04:06:35] sick I like
[04:06:39] these wait never mind that's not what I
[04:06:41] thought it was I lied wait where are
[04:06:43] like the one time clear
[04:06:45] things like these things are there any
[04:06:51] others that I didn't
[04:06:53] do the Seventh Son of the Seventh
[04:07:01] Son should I get gian's weapon for
[04:07:03] calaro no like maybe but like I wouldn't
[04:07:06] recommend spending your like freeo play
[04:07:08] pulls or whale pulls on another
[04:07:10] character's weapon for your other
[04:07:12] character's weapon
[04:07:15] although this is purely feels crafting
[04:07:18] this is entirely FS crafting don't take
[04:07:20] it with a grain of
[04:07:23] salt you do get a free five star uh
[04:07:26] weapon at level 45 so that I I do think
[04:07:29] that is a better way Kar can't even use
[04:07:32] his weapon well I know um Gian what okay
[04:07:35] my bad gien is a [ __ ] attacker like a
[04:07:38] heavy
[04:07:39] attacker or residence Liberation but
[04:07:41] it's heavy attacks inside of it Karo he
[04:07:43] he's damager but do they count as what
[04:07:45] does these things count up does it count
[04:07:47] as Liberation damage let me cuz it's
[04:07:48] hounds Roar but what the [ __ ] does that
[04:07:50] count as hounds Roar uh oh considered
[04:07:52] basic yeah so you want the basic buff
[04:07:54] this doesn't buff basic right yeah no it
[04:07:56] doesn't I mean it's still good stats but
[04:07:58] yeah it doesn't buff
[04:07:59] basic I don't know what the free five
[04:08:01] star is though like I don't know what
[04:08:02] the stats of the St now I have to it's
[04:08:04] fine I'm learning I'm learning I'm
[04:08:05] learning uh broad blade this looks cool
[04:08:08] what does it do attack attack increase
[04:08:11] energy regen sure when resident skill is
[04:08:13] released increased resonation Liberation
[04:08:21] damage that's POG uh how does this this
[04:08:24] say does it scale on only basic or
[04:08:27] Liberation
[04:08:30] to cuz it says is considered basic
[04:08:33] attack basic attack is replaced with
[04:08:34] hounds
[04:08:38] roar I think it's basic
[04:08:42] [Music]
[04:08:49] [Music]
[04:08:53] J weapon is only 5% better according
[04:08:55] yeah but that's probably just
[04:08:59] um they're probably both good just
[04:09:01] because the stats are really high cuz
[04:09:02] they're five
[04:09:06] stars which isn't a bad thing but it's
[04:09:08] like it doesn't look like they're made
[04:09:09] for him but if it's like there's no
[04:09:12] better options right now
[04:09:14] wait what is the battle let me check the
[04:09:15] battle pass
[04:09:21] one crit rate increased attack upon
[04:09:25] dealing yeah uh wait what this four time
[04:09:27] 5 20% attack this effect last for 7
[04:09:29] seconds and be triggered so it's 20%
[04:09:31] attack yeah that was pretty good the
[04:09:35] problem is is like oh is this is this
[04:09:37] even the broad blade yeah it is it is
[04:09:39] wait is it why does it look so skinny
[04:09:41] yeah it is the broad blade this is just
[04:09:43] stats
[04:09:46] though okay are there any other one time
[04:09:48] things no I should be just killing
[04:09:50] bosses yes okay what is
[04:09:53] this oh it's the yeah I should do that
[04:09:55] it's [ __ ] simulated

[04:11:43] kidding we're like 13 we're trying to
[04:11:44] get 15 but I'm uh I'm pushing 30 no I'm
[04:11:46] not I'm just uh I'm I'm exp I got
[04:11:49] sidetracked I don't know what I've been
[04:11:50] doing for the past 30 minutes but we'll
[04:11:51] go back to being efficient starting
[04:11:56] now run
[04:11:58] [Music]
[04:12:02] challenge I should probably just go farm
[04:12:03] echos like in New areas where I haven't
[04:12:05] been before so we'll start do like I
[04:12:06] mean I am technically in a new area
[04:12:08] right now so that is lowkey what we're
[04:12:09] doing I
[04:12:14] yeah yeah yeah I'm fine I'm fine I'm
[04:12:16] fine it's fine it's fine it's fine it's
[04:12:20] fine bro I moved so fast wait where' I
[04:12:23] have to go oh there
[04:12:26] wait
[04:12:29] oh I see that was a little PGA it's okay
[04:12:43] I meant to press uh L to change team so
[04:12:45] I press T because t for team and then I
[04:12:47] didn't get to change my team in
[04:13:02] time you check out the craft broad blade
[04:13:04] yes it it looked pretty good uh for but
[04:13:08] there's a free Force selector that I
[04:13:10] could just choose without needing to
[04:13:10] farm 500 ores and it gives attack
[04:13:12] percent so we take
[04:13:27] that I wonder if I should restart my
[04:13:32] game like it's running fine but I wonder
[04:13:34] if it could run better
[04:13:51] chest Don't Mind If I
[04:13:57] Do usually helps me
[04:14:07] noted for some reason I thought I saw an
[04:14:09] echo but like I know like the human
[04:14:10] enemies can't drop an echo but I was
[04:14:12] like I thought I saw like a yellow like
[04:14:14] thing so I was
[04:14:28] confused
[04:14:30] Bo any new Echoes that might be new like
[04:14:34] I don't think we have a purple of that
[04:14:35] let's let's take the purple is there
[04:14:37] anything else anything else anything
[04:14:38] else maybe no we have the plan but
[04:14:41] there's chest there okay
[04:14:56] POG boom gold gold I mean purple purple
[04:14:59] purple purple

[04:16:22] haven't uh like gotten an echo from or
[04:16:25] like past two star just to
[04:16:28] like cuz it'll probably lead us to a new
[04:16:31] area and being in a new area means a lot
[04:16:33] of stuff and if we can also level our
[04:16:34] data bank then we're
[04:16:37] pogging might as well do this though I

[04:21:23] level I kind of want to level sonano
[04:21:26] Chad is she
[04:21:27] good her outro skill is a buff
[04:21:30] right it is basic attack
[04:21:38] deepen go PL thanks for the prime
[04:21:43] [Music]
[04:21:46] for Encore yeah but I assume if the
[04:21:49] basic attack even is a big part of her
[04:21:50] buff it's probably good for calaro too
[04:21:53] right cuz
[04:21:54] calaro uh scales on Basics like his
[04:21:57] hounds are his basic attack
[04:22:03] damage so it should work I might level
[04:22:05] her she's also
[04:22:08] pretty what the [ __ ]
[04:22:11] is is I going to ignore my sub for the
[04:22:14] seventh month straight and not thank me
[04:22:16] again thank you in bqq for the seven
[04:22:29] months D I actually don't have swords I
[04:22:31] only have
[04:22:32] one sword of Knight edge of
[04:22:41] Knight Co
[04:22:48] dude I I'm literally doing the like
[04:22:50] thing I say not to do where you level 50
[04:22:51] characters but okay if I do this chat do
[04:22:54] we all agree and consent to the fact
[04:22:57] that I'm going to have to spend more
[04:22:59] stamina because I'm spreading myself
[04:23:00] thin which means if I refresh once or
[04:23:02] twice you can't get mad at me cuz like
[04:23:04] dude like I'm doing this for you I'm
[04:23:06] doing this for Content I'm doing this to
[04:23:07] be able to test multiple characters to
[04:23:10] know who's good agre okay
[04:23:13] okay
[04:23:20] okay cuz I think I'm going to have a
[04:23:24] Karo team and then Karo is going to run
[04:23:26] son
[04:23:27] sonwa and we're going to have a Jin what
[04:23:30] the [ __ ] is his name GN team with
[04:23:33] mortify but eventually we'll get yinin
[04:23:36] but then we still need a third team
[04:23:37] anyways so it's
[04:23:40] fine there's a r Eric appreciate it hope
[04:23:44] you're streaming
[04:23:46] well were you
[04:23:49] weathering top 10 mistakes you're making
[04:23:51] bro this is literally if I made that
[04:23:52] video well I kind of did but it wasn't a
[04:23:54] top 10 uh okay sorry about nightbot the
[04:23:57] I mean look nightbot just Autos I'm
[04:23:59] sorry it is what it is okay but but but
[04:24:01] if I did if I did make that though if I
[04:24:03] did make that
[04:24:04] though uh I would say don't like [ __ ]
[04:24:07] level 26 characters what am I doing I'm
[04:24:09] leveling 26 characters
[04:24:14] I'm getting timed out I'm sorry it's
[04:24:16] nightbot right let me trial her I know
[04:24:19] what her I know
[04:24:22] okay watching on mute looks like he's

[04:24:31] right any I appreciate it thanks who are
[04:24:34] the best characters for calaro yinin
[04:24:37] she's not out yet outside of that any
[04:24:40] honestly dude I feel like team building
[04:24:41] in this game is you just put any good
[04:24:42] characters with each other however
[04:24:44] unless they like all need like 50 years
[04:24:46] of field time and most characters quick
[04:24:47] swap you like intro outro spam but I
[04:24:50] feel like like characters that can buff
[04:24:52] him are good cuz he does a lot of
[04:24:55] damage or mortify cuz he's
[04:24:57] broken she can buff too it looks like
[04:25:00] with her outro but I don't know how good
[04:25:02] she is yet I think she's good but I'm
[04:25:04] not
[04:25:08] sure what the [ __ ] that was the entire
[04:25:10] tutorial

[04:27:15] can get conserto energy like build up
[04:27:17] their [ __ ] outro skill fast like how

[05:24:12] game in which case the aster I wasted
[05:24:14] didn't matter cuz I'm not playing so

[05:33:27] just swap their mod can I literally can
[05:33:29] you should be able to swap kit two
[05:33:31] characters kits like you just like take
[05:33:33] both characters and then they both do
[05:33:35] what the other one does like you swap
[05:33:36] them
[05:33:59] oh there you
[05:34:00] go that was easy just [ __ ] do that

[05:48:07] more important to level right now

[05:51:17] song does upgrading weapon change away
[05:51:19] looks no I don't think maybe I don't
[05:51:22] think so I mean this I feel like this
[05:51:23] looks the
[05:51:28] same I don't know
[05:51:39] oh
[05:51:41] ready
[05:51:51] hi wait what parts of Arena kit is all
[05:51:54] her I know she has a buff on her outro

[05:51:57] Forte or like passive I
[05:52:01] forget I want to know what the [ __ ] I
[05:52:02] need to do on her to like
[05:52:06] Al okay that's easy
[05:52:14] then yeah I was just pressing alt just
[05:52:17] in case it buffed but yeah okay
[05:52:21] po
[05:52:23] purple ooh
[05:52:28] purple bet we going to send mortify
[05:52:35] now need to buy flowers
[05:52:37] though no reaction to the game
[05:52:48] no it's free just go try it
[05:52:51] out that's how it starts that's how
[05:52:54] crippling gacha addiction starts I'm
[05:52:56] sure fob Master downloaded his first
[05:52:58] gacha game because it was free he was
[05:53:00] like oh this is free right this is free
[05:53:03] right
[05:53:13] okay so can I get these [ __ ] pumpkin
[05:53:15] it's not pumpkins these mushrooms fast
[05:53:17] or do I [ __ ] drop 27k for
[05:53:25] nine cuz I feel like I shouldn't drop
[05:53:30] 27k 36 on the map
[05:53:41] when I was a young
[05:53:53] boy oh I bought one too many wait I need
[05:53:56] six I thought I
[05:54:03] needed we need to Echo Farm Echo I
[05:54:06] needed this Echo right crownless
[05:54:20] yeah why'd you ask if I think the not
[05:54:22] land teaser was Goofy I have never used
[05:54:24] the word goofy in my life did you watch
[05:54:27] someone who said it was Goofy and how
[05:54:29] did you find that the word
[05:54:31] goofy I have I don't know if I've called
[05:54:34] anything goofy ever
[05:54:55] [Music]
[05:55:04] for it looked silly I mean isn't that a
[05:55:06] good thing if it does
[05:55:08] though like don't you want it to be like
[05:55:11] [ __ ] kind of fun and
[05:55:13] new like if it looked like [ __ ] we
[05:55:15] already saw or it just looked like a
[05:55:16] cool area we'd be like okay cool area
[05:55:18] wow I can't wait to get five chests and
[05:55:20] then
[05:55:27] leave but I feel like so my my indicator
[05:55:31] on whether something's popular or not is
[05:55:33] if Z Jeff likes it then it's not popular
[05:55:35] so like for example like Dragon spine
[05:55:37] which like I like Dragon spine but it's
[05:55:38] not popular and he he's like not a big
[05:55:40] fan of font which is popular no he likes
[05:55:42] the quest but like the explor like the
[05:55:44] underwater [ __ ] and he he liked the the
[05:55:48] the the the teaser so I assume that
[05:55:49] means Chad doesn't like the
[05:55:51] teaser it's usually just the
[05:55:55] opposite no I liked it
[05:55:59] though [ __ ] swing in lava what the
[05:56:02] hell I'm not a swim in lava
[05:56:24] that be more miserable and dark no [ __ ]
[05:56:26] that you don't want to get depression
[05:56:28] just cuz you're exploring a like sad
[05:56:30] area like anonia is sick but like every
[05:56:32] time I go there I'm like I want to
[05:56:34] [ __ ] die like I don't have like I
[05:56:36] like the area I like the idea of it I
[05:56:38] like the like like the I'm going to be
[05:56:40] honest I do all the quests but like what
[05:56:41] I think the lore of it is but I don't
[05:56:43] feel like like doing all the like [ __ ]
[05:56:45] that's
[05:56:50] there and if someone like yeah I don't
[05:56:53] know
[05:56:56] [Music]
[05:57:24] but I mean I don't know it looks I mean
[05:57:26] I guess I'm also looking at it not from
[05:57:28] a like a viewer perspective but from
[05:57:30] like a player who's going to probably
[05:57:32] full like explore it it looks fun to
[05:57:34] explore given that there's a lot of like
[05:57:36] new
[05:57:37] [ __ ] which is cool cuz I think a like
[05:57:40] base exploration in that game with no
[05:57:43] mechanics kind of is like whatever and
[05:57:46] it like I don't feel like doing that
[05:57:48] whereas like sumaru had a lot of [ __ ]
[05:57:50] that made me want to like okay like not
[05:57:52] the desert part but like okay there's
[05:57:53] like the thing where I can like grapple
[05:57:54] in the sky and like I can bounce on a
[05:57:56] mushroom I'm like okay
[05:58:01] cool but if it's literally just like it
[05:58:03] looks pretty or like the lore is cool
[05:58:05] like that's cool but like do I want to
[05:58:06] explore not
[05:58:07] really like I I my Chasm is at [ __ ]
[05:58:10] 40% like I'm I do not want to explore
[05:58:12] the
[05:58:17] chasm no Z liked it a
[05:58:19] lot I was saying
[05:58:29] yeah I don't have a strong opinion on it
[05:58:32] so far I don't really care but I think
[05:58:34] the fact that you can I think the fact
[05:58:36] you can like turn into [ __ ] or ride [ __ ]
[05:58:37] is
[05:58:42] cool just the hook dude listen it
[05:58:44] spoiled me okay Electro [ __ ] graus
[05:58:48] from inauma it literally gets shat on by
[05:58:50] the sumaru
[05:58:53] [ __ ] I'm
[05:59:01] sorry did you know Elder ring is open
[05:59:04] world [ __ ] you
[05:59:23] CH Veil is good
[05:59:32] too yeah I don't
[05:59:34] know the [ __ ] I know this guy
[05:59:44] hello but like it's it's weird for me
[05:59:46] though cuz I kind of stopped caring
[05:59:49] about everything else in the teaser once
[05:59:51] we saw the like not stopped caring but
[05:59:53] like nothing stuck to my mind except the
[05:59:55] like endgame mode or not it's not I
[05:59:57] don't want to call it end game I
[05:59:58] actually got mad at well I didn't get
[05:59:59] mad but I was like marai uploaded it for
[06:00:02] like 1 second and the title was uh it
[06:00:04] was called like new end game I was like
[06:00:05] yo don't call it game cuz I don't know
[06:00:06] what like it might not be I don't know
[06:00:07] what the [ __ ] it is so I changed
[06:00:10] it but you like whatever like combat
[06:00:19] mode oh
[06:00:29] [Music]
[06:00:36] why is it not end game it could be but
[06:00:37] it could also not be like we don't
[06:00:39] really know my understanding is it'll be
[06:00:41] similar to Star rail where it's like you
[06:00:42] have memory of chaos and pure fiction
[06:00:44] you have that and that but like would I
[06:00:47] say I think if anything
[06:00:51] like I don't know I don't I don't
[06:00:54] consider it I think what endgame is or
[06:00:57] should be is like something that you can
[06:00:58] do over and over
[06:01:00] again like I don't think Abyss is
[06:01:02] considered endgame it's like the closest
[06:01:04] thing we have but it's not really
[06:01:07] repeatable right like it's only
[06:01:09] repeatable if you're me and you want to
[06:01:10] play 500 teams but like that's not
[06:01:15] like it's not the average person or
[06:01:18] you're like speedr running right but
[06:01:19] like
[06:01:25] you repeatable equal rewards no well
[06:01:29] yes yes and no there has to be yeah it
[06:01:33] dep I guess I was I was thinking yeah
[06:01:36] yes but reward in a the sense of like
[06:01:38] there has to be a reason to do it it
[06:01:39] doesn't have to be like for like Primo
[06:01:41] gems it just has to like there has to be
[06:01:42] a reason like you're not just going to
[06:01:44] do something like yeah you want to have
[06:01:46] fun like yeah but like there has to be a
[06:01:48] reason to do something like why do you
[06:01:49] farm artifacts because you want to get a
[06:01:51] better like why do you spend your resin
[06:01:53] you want artifacts or you want like a
[06:01:54] build or you want like this
[06:02:12] Prim is the only thing people care about
[06:02:14] yeah but it's not everything like it's a
[06:02:16] big
[06:02:17] thing but like how do I explain this you
[06:02:20] can release a game mode or something
[06:02:22] that has Primos at a level that's
[06:02:25] achievable by your average player like
[06:02:27] average player who's like playing the
[06:02:28] game trying right like actually like
[06:02:30] playing not like the most sweaty but
[06:02:32] like you know playing well or or doing
[06:02:35] what you're supposed to do and then you
[06:02:37] can make the further harder rewards
[06:02:40] things that are uh something that would
[06:02:43] reward a player that plays a lot and
[06:02:45] wants to go further than the average
[06:02:47] like okay I cleared the DPS check for
[06:02:50] example like on like you know Cosmetics
[06:02:52] or like a weapon or like a [ __ ]
[06:02:54] character or like a like a skin or like
[06:02:56] a animated name card or a pet or a
[06:02:59] [ __ ] like anything or a lot of things
[06:03:03] it it's like um pretty gems are what
[06:03:06] make people excited but the other things
[06:03:08] are what make people like Stay playing
[06:03:10] the game like if the game's not fun and
[06:03:13] they give me unlimited gems like
[06:03:14] literally unlimited I can C6 R5 everyone
[06:03:17] I'll play for a bit but then I'll be
[06:03:18] like okay well what am I doing like I
[06:03:20] can go kill a a boss wow but like I'll
[06:03:23] quit even if I have infinite currency
[06:03:26] but even resin too like infinite like
[06:03:28] what can I do but if they give me
[06:03:30] something where it's like okay well kill
[06:03:31] a thousand like here's a [ __ ] boss
[06:03:34] you can do with your friends kill it
[06:03:35] kill it a bunch of times and there's a
[06:03:36] one in a thousand chance you get a

[06:03:47] [ __ ] 500 hours of my life maybe like
[06:03:50] I would but like your average player
[06:03:52] wouldn't but what they would do is do it
[06:03:54] maybe 50 times instead of a thousand and
[06:03:56] then get Primo
[06:03:58] gems here's how you get your 500,000
[06:04:01] Primo gems oh I'll do it and then past
[06:04:03] that point it's like well do you want
[06:04:05] other stuff that's cool
[06:04:08] maybe no I have a job okay you can skip
[06:04:14] it their old school RuneScape effect
[06:04:17] caught man I'm just trying to turn I'm
[06:04:18] just trying to turn every game I play
[06:04:20] into that game caught you got me hey you
[06:04:22] got me you got
[06:04:33] me you like the comment this game wa
[06:04:36] yeah yeah I think weaing waves combat is
[06:04:37] really
[06:04:39] good although unless they changed Co-op
[06:04:42] I think the
[06:04:44] co-op
[06:04:47] um you can't okay how does intro outro
[06:04:51] work in
[06:04:53] Co-op I haven't co-oped yet T thanks the
[06:04:57] gifted or no sorry the tier one it
[06:05:01] doesn't cuz that's my problem with like
[06:05:03] the co-op it's like I feel like
[06:05:06] because there's no like reactions or
[06:05:07] anything coab is just kind of OAB boonga
[06:05:09] like it's it's fine to do with your
[06:05:10] friends I again I I didn't do it since
[06:05:13] beta so I don't know but you have a side
[06:05:18] button oh do you am I getting deated I
[06:05:24] mean use
[06:05:27] either's you can intro not
[06:05:31] outro they changed it a
[06:05:34] bit you can switch and use your intro
[06:05:37] outro if your gauge is
[06:05:40] full well I should try
[06:05:44] that you click a friend's
[06:05:49] pfp okay that's cool then if that works
[06:05:53] that's cool I was going to say if
[06:05:55] there's nothing to do other than just
[06:05:56] Mash left
[06:06:00] click it would be a bit like not ideal
[06:06:03] but if you can that's pretty sick
[06:06:08] is it
[06:06:09] good are you flexing a piece right now
[06:06:11] I'm going to check but if you're flexing
[06:06:13] so help me
[06:06:16] God okay that's not that big of a flex
[06:06:19] it's it's decent it's it's Arrow damage
[06:06:21] bonus on an arrow
[06:06:24] set actually that's probably a ban
[06:06:27] that's probably given given the socio
[06:06:29] economic climate of the game that's
[06:06:31] probably a ban
[06:06:36] why is everyone saying to lower the
[06:06:37] bright has there been like a Reddit post
[06:06:39] or like a Twitter post on like lowering
[06:06:40] the brightness I feel like 20 people
[06:06:43] have told me to lower the brightness in
[06:06:44] like the last like 30
[06:06:51] minutes I I don't disagree like I think
[06:06:53] it looks good but I I don't think I want
[06:06:55] to keep it on low
[06:06:59] brightness does it even look better
[06:07:01] though like I feel like it's like barely
[06:07:02] noticeable let me Max low brightness it

[07:01:23] didn't read karo's I don't know what the
[07:01:24] [ __ ] his first one does so I I don't

[07:02:18] though cuz keep in mind I can't use my
[07:02:20] best DPS here so I'm going to have to do
[07:02:22] some copium it'll be okay oh I should
[07:02:24] level my weapon too let me see if I have
[07:02:26] the mats probably
[07:02:30] don't
[07:02:32] actually don't tell anyone I did
[07:02:38] this wait I lost all my three star
[07:02:40] weapons what the [ __ ] I got to stop auto
[07:02:42] adding what the hell wait that was
[07:02:45] [ __ ] I have no three stars okay I'm
[07:02:48] actually going to have to pull what the
[07:02:50] [ __ ]
[07:02:55] oops all right
[07:03:06] without
[07:03:25] me
[07:03:30] wait this is on
[07:03:41] set this is Electro
[07:04:00] offset this is a a lot of stats though
[07:04:03] for an
[07:04:05] offset do I have another good
[07:04:12] one not
[07:04:14] really how do I fit this in
[07:04:37] I guess for now cuz I'm running the
[07:04:39] twopiece anyways I don't need to run
[07:04:41] this but
[07:05:04] no I Chad I think there should be a law
[07:05:06] requiring every Got Game to use the same
[07:05:08] word for every element I don't care [ __ ]
[07:05:10] it it's wind fire water the the ice like
[07:05:13] [ __ ] you I'm not learning a new word for
[07:05:15] every game stop it stop
[07:05:20] it arrows cringe and an Nemo's cringe
[07:05:22] they're both cringe just just call
[07:05:24] everything
[07:05:30] wind it's win
[07:05:32] you didn't invent wind little bro you
[07:05:34] don't have to change the
[07:05:44] [Music]
[07:05:45] word okay I probably bench this
[07:05:49] piece cuz it's a four
[07:05:53] cost I do 3 three three
[07:05:58] three maybe not actually no I definitely
[07:06:00] want twopiece two piece I don't do well
[07:06:02] 3 333 I can do twopiece
[07:06:09] [Music]
[07:06:19] twopiece if this gets crit I'll level it
[07:06:22] basic
[07:06:23] attack wait that's good I forgot C is a
[07:06:27] basic
[07:06:35] energy regen I'll take
[07:06:37] that [ __ ] it all in baby all in baby all
[07:06:41] in baby HP don't talk to me all
[07:06:54] in so that's how it's going to be huh
[07:07:06] I wonder if I'm ever using this piece
[07:07:08] the stats are genuinely good like the
[07:07:10] set sucks though but it's also a three
[07:07:13] cost that I can't fit right now unless I
[07:07:14] bench this this main set is nine crit
[07:07:16] rate this subet is six crit rate so it's
[07:07:19] like literally just
[07:07:21] better like I I feel like I'm not coping
[07:07:24] am I coping but I just I don't want I
[07:07:25] don't want its effect so
[07:07:42] well this thing's a far cost so
[07:08:01] I actually don't know how to figure like
[07:08:03] what the [ __ ] to do
[07:08:05] here I mean I guess this doesn't fit
[07:08:07] it's just too it's definitely better
[07:08:09] than this piece like the other piece
[07:08:11] like this thing is
[07:08:12] useless this thing is also kind of bad
[07:08:14] but I already leveled it and I don't
[07:08:16] want to like throw it away if I leveled
[07:08:18] it it's just a temporary build like I
[07:08:21] don't want to invest too
[07:08:23] much
[07:08:26] um I definitely need the Thunder manif
[07:08:29] effect what does this do no
[07:08:43] after the final hit
[07:09:02] why do these have to be for costs
[07:09:06] sadge honestly this might be fine
[07:09:27] too I don't
[07:09:29] know I probably want to bench this piece
[07:09:31] then eventually not yet cuz like I
[07:09:34] can't okay we're probably fine then
[07:09:36] whatever I just need to put random [ __ ]
[07:09:38] now wait what I need I need one
[07:09:43] attack how much cost do I have two
[07:09:50] left
[07:09:56] um one more cost could be anything now
[07:10:00] it doesn't matter
[07:10:08] minus 25 months minus
[07:10:11] $25
[07:10:13] us damn well paper P thanks for 25 mods
[07:10:17] I appreciate
[07:10:20] it imagine doing all this gearing just
[07:10:23] to [ __ ] die just to [ __ ] lose nah

[07:12:10] eye frames they they're fake they're

[07:14:06] counter dude it like pauses the game it
[07:14:09] doesn't like actually like if frame you
[07:14:10] it like pauses the game and then your
[07:14:11] alt is over and then it resets and
[07:14:13] you're like boom boom boom and then you
[07:14:14] die like it resumes and you're

[07:15:06] arina's level
[07:15:09] 40 let's give it a try let's give it a
[07:15:14] try oh my God I got
[07:15:18] [ __ ] why does he scratch his
[07:15:23] butt I should I did that the buff but I
[07:15:25] shouldn't have done that actually let's
[07:15:28] just go [ __ ] it
[07:15:43] for oh I took damage really
[07:16:01] oh I used my echo at the wrong time
[07:16:03] wrong place wrong time wrong place wrong
[07:16:05] I could KN I need to counter that
[07:16:08] attack it's like not ready for
[07:16:18] it I'm
[07:16:20] so I think my level 40 finina not finina
[07:16:24] Verina dies if I don't Dodge
[07:16:27] that I don't know if I can use oh my
[07:16:30] [ __ ] not
[07:16:32] again I mean dude I Ed my ALT like what
[07:16:35] do you want me to do run away I just
[07:16:36] used my ALT like what is that timing I
[07:16:39] just used my
[07:16:41] ALT I could have ran away but like I
[07:16:43] don't know I should have just ran
[07:16:45] away
[07:16:53] whatever my real [ __ ] stuck in the
[07:16:57] air the thing with my echo is I read it
[07:16:59] and it says I only get the elro buff
[07:17:01] after the last hit but like bro am I
[07:17:04] really going to stay on field doing
[07:17:05] eight hits against an enemy that attacks
[07:17:07] six times per second and one shot like
[07:17:09] almost one shots
[07:17:11] me like how do I even like get away with
[07:17:20] that
[07:17:21] I
[07:17:23] DOD
[07:17:26] okay I'll do I'll Dodge attack and I'll
[07:17:28] try to get my echo off let's see if it
[07:17:29] works is he going to bro I could have
[07:17:34] echoed yeah like I I don't know I don't
[07:17:36] know how to get it off
[07:17:39] whatever can't you swap you can swap
[07:17:42] cancel but it swap cancels the hit your
[07:17:43] on I don't think it like cuz it reads
[07:17:46] can I open in the menu it it
[07:17:49] says that it increases how do I check
[07:17:52] this set yeah after the final hit
[07:17:55] increase the damage so I have to do like
[07:17:57] [ __ ] six hits like that's so long
[07:18:01] I don't know how to get away with that
[07:18:03] wait did I just cancel my
[07:18:04] ALT oops I can't what the
[07:18:11] [ __ ] oh I don't have my Al now I guess
[07:18:14] when he's down like now I can use
[07:18:21] it but like I don't even have time to Al
[07:18:45] how was easy oh he's going to do the
[07:18:47] spinning attack I got to get the [ __ ]
[07:18:48] out of
[07:18:50] here is he I don't know what he's
[07:18:55] doing Dodge Dodge DOD DOD do get the
[07:18:57] [ __ ] out get the [ __ ]
[07:18:59] out oh I [ __ ] up that Dodge but I it

[07:19:32] was doing that
[07:19:33] attack oh I was doing well that's fine
[07:19:36] [ __ ] I didn't know what that was I was
[07:19:38] like mid animation he was [ __ ]
[07:19:40] huffing and
[07:19:42] puffing I should have swapped to mortify
[07:19:44] and just died on
[07:19:46] him
[07:19:52] [ __ ] oh I already took damage okay that
[07:19:55] mean I don't know that was a tilted run
[07:19:57] that was a tilted run that was a tilted
[07:19:59] run
[07:20:12] why do I not have that okay I got it I
[07:20:14] was like why did I lose the timing on
[07:20:18] that what the [ __ ] just happened
[07:20:34] my okay I maybe need to give my Verina
[07:20:36] uh an echo or two so I actually do some
[07:20:38] healing right now I do n
[07:21:05] what the [ __ ]
[07:21:07] I I didn't dodge
[07:21:34] I don't know what he's doing should I be
[07:21:36] afraid yes yes be
[07:21:41] afraid I can't tell he's spinning I'm
[07:21:43] just worried about the Spin Attack no
[07:21:45] he's not
[07:21:56] spinning all right
[07:21:58] good boom and then we Al
[07:22:01] [Music]
[07:22:02] calaro
[07:22:06] moment oh that was no way
[07:22:22] fine okay thank God my life flashed
[07:22:26] before my eyes
[07:22:28] [Music]
[07:22:32] trying to save my stamina
[07:22:34] here I could have
[07:22:50] parried nice nice nice go go go go go go
[07:22:53] go go go I have no time for games
[07:23:01] I don't know why I use my either that
[07:23:03] was
[07:23:15] bad I hate her intro I hate like dashing
[07:23:17] onto the enemy
[07:23:36] I'm mortify cuz if he dies it's not that
[07:23:37] big of a deal compared to the
[07:23:41] others I can't Al them in there okay
[07:23:43] thank God I was going to die
[07:24:06] all right
[07:24:07] easy F we did
[07:24:13] it dude we we did all that for two HP
[07:24:16] Echoes we literally did all that for two
[07:24:18] HP Echoes everything we just did twice
[07:24:24] was that's fine at least we did it the
[07:24:27] next one's a five star so that's POG I
[07:24:29] don't know if we can do 61 though maybe
[07:24:33] probably going to get one shot unless we
[07:24:34] level
[07:24:37] F that was a good run it was a good run
[07:24:39] I'm happy with it not hel not Hast
[07:24:42] thanks the to gifted I appreciate
[07:24:47] it why you for outside his alt honestly
[07:24:50] I I I remembered once in the fight and I
[07:24:53] did it once I think outside I just I
[07:24:56] just didn't think about it it also kind
[07:24:57] of doesn't it take stamina it's kind of
[07:25:01] sometimes I have like no stamina or I'm
[07:25:02] worried to use it but I I should like I
[07:25:04] definitely
[07:25:05] should I just only thought of it
[07:25:17] once the best C team no well
[07:25:20] honestly probably but Yin Lin's better
[07:25:22] here also you can use the ice girl cuz
[07:25:24] she Buffs your Basics which is pretty
[07:25:25] good I actually want to try this team
[07:25:28] it's only I mean 38% is a lot
[07:25:33] heavy attack damage deepen that's not
[07:25:34] this well you do do do a
[07:25:48] heavy should I go for calaro or Gian I'm
[07:25:51] free to play uh well if you can get Gan
[07:25:52] get Gan but Karo you can pick for free
[07:25:55] so
[07:26:06] yeah all right I'm probably going to get
[07:26:08] [ __ ] here but might as well try it
[07:26:09] although I'm I'm definitely underleveled
[07:26:11] and undergeared I don't know why I use
[07:26:12] my e oh I can't Dodge during that I
[07:26:15] forgot try to [ __ ] Dodge with my echo

[07:29:54] counter Circle okay I'll good I'll good
[07:29:56] that was a good try that was a good try
[07:29:57] that was a good try we can get it we can
[07:29:58] get it I believe we can get it
[07:30:01] that was a good try I don't think we
[07:30:02] need to level I think like even with our
[07:30:04] gear right now we can do
[07:30:07] it I mean I could level like a no that
[07:30:11] doesn't
[07:30:12] matter [ __ ] it resonance skill
[07:30:18] sure I don't think I'm going to bench
[07:30:20] this character so I might as
[07:30:22] well
[07:30:24] well all
[07:30:27] right was never time to run out dude
[07:30:30] like a minute 30 I I think it's like a
[07:30:32] little tight like we're obviously under
[07:30:35] like geared
[07:30:39] but oh my ver yeah I was like [ __ ]

[07:31:19] it oh did I not do the I didn't do the
[07:31:21] last hit it's
[07:31:23] fine I don't think the damage bonus
[07:31:25] matters cuz it would have expired by the
[07:31:26] time I Al again so whatever
[07:31:40] I can dodge
[07:31:43] S I don't like that Echo like obviously
[07:31:45] it's good but it feels so

[07:31:50] gifted my dad no I'm
[07:31:57] fine I'm just going to Al I think he's
[07:31:59] about to do the attack that sucks though

[07:37:40] broken by the
[07:37:42] way that Echo is [ __ ] stupid broken I
[07:37:45] thought it was only for the active
[07:37:46] charact like the the character you used

[07:47:24] end but like that was kind of clutch at
[07:47:25] the start dude I kind of dude I kind of
[07:47:28] clutched up I kind of clutched up the
[07:47:30] end I [ __ ] up cuz I was panicking
[07:47:32] but 20 asteroides 250 D data set one 15K
[07:47:37] watch this watch this crit crit for our
[07:47:39] for our efforts we are
[07:47:47] rewarded I mean it's fine attack's okay
[07:47:49] I mean it's not crit
[07:47:52] but it's not really good but it's
[07:47:57] usable better than the fense
[07:48:00] Dam and what's cool is um now for the
[07:48:03] other ones we can actually use
[07:48:05] Jan Kar is fun though I like this
[07:48:15] character nice well attack's attack we
[07:48:17] take
[07:48:19] it I mean it's better than this
[07:48:22] right honestly depends what it rolls
[07:48:30] how much crit do I
[07:48:32] have
[07:48:36] 26 damn that was [ __ ] fun what the
[07:48:38] hell wait maybe this game's
[07:48:57] lit should be your sponsored the sponsor
[07:48:59] ended like 6 hours ago I just I don't I
[07:49:03] just been having fun or like 5 hours
[07:49:07] ago okay I should probably sleep at 7:
[07:49:10] a.m. I should order breakfast or I can
[07:49:13] just make eggs actually I'll probably
[07:49:14] just make
[07:49:15] a Eric Tron thanks for the gifted
[07:49:18] appreciate you should I add in the title
[07:49:21] yeah I didn't take it out
[07:49:23] but yeah
[07:49:31] okay
[07:49:34] um so ninja think is the gift that it
[07:49:36] means a lot thank you thank
[07:49:40] you you know
[07:49:42] what let's level the fruit of our labor
[07:49:46] let's see what felan Bingle has to give
[07:49:51] us I I don't know if I should be
[07:49:52] leveling this I'm going to be honest
[07:49:56] but wait do I want to use the [ __ ]
[07:49:58] yellow tuner on this wait let me
[07:50:10] think I kind of
[07:50:14] don't I kind of don't I'm not going to
[07:50:17] lie I kind of don't want to I don't know
[07:50:18] why I just leveled this to
[07:50:21] four it's definitely better than crit
[07:50:24] right now cuz I have such low I mean is
[07:50:26] it I I feel like my crit is so so low
[07:50:28] that I'd rather just have attack like
[07:50:30] right now but
[07:50:41] like hxr has a
[07:50:46] prime five crit rate
[07:50:59] you start more crit damage in Gena no
[07:51:01] you're you're you're getting click
[07:51:02] baited look this crit damage isn't
[07:51:05] actually 160 it's the multiplier so it's
[07:51:10] 62 like this one is not
[07:51:13] here you start at 50 it says 150 but I
[07:51:16] don't know why they do that it's like
[07:51:18] the multiplier is
[07:51:22] 150 so we're I'm I'm I'm I only have 60
[07:51:25] crit rate uh damage I mean
[07:51:37] I think I mean I could be
[07:51:44] wrong it's 150 no no but like the
[07:51:46] multiplier is 150 that means you're
[07:51:48] doing 50 more but like do you think in
[07:51:50] gcha when you do a crit on 50 crit
[07:51:51] damage you're doing 50% of your non-
[07:51:53] crit so like you're doing less damage it
[07:51:55] just like from genin terms it just means
[07:51:58] like the one isn't here
[07:52:00] basically I think I could be wrong but
[07:52:02] I'm pretty
[07:52:04] sure cuz when I started I thought like
[07:52:07] in beta I thought that I had [ __ ] 160
[07:52:09] crit damage I was like what the
[07:52:15] hell yo thanks for another gift it HR uh
[07:52:22] XRS yeah
[07:52:32] here the ones already shown yeah yeah it
[07:52:34] just it looks weird to see like a five

[08:06:11] matter I mean the fall from Greg it has
[08:06:15] to be studied but ER crit damage crit
[08:06:17] rate I don't care I don't care I don't
[08:06:19] care it could have had you can get heavy
[08:06:21] attack damage right is that a
[08:06:23] thing there's a heavy is there a heavy
[08:06:25] attack sub stat
[08:06:33] yeah okay so I celebrated a bit too
[08:06:35] early but ER crit crit is
[08:06:40] insane also heavy attack damage and crit
[08:06:43] damage eventually become the same thing
[08:06:45] true because because once I get 99 crit
[08:06:47] rate then crit damage equal damage not
[08:06:50] really cuz it's different but like [ __ ]
