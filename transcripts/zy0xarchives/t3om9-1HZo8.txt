[00:10:56] genin maybe zzz as well I don't know but
[00:10:59] definitely
[00:11:00] genin um cuz I think what I'm doing for
[00:11:03] genin is we have like 2K resin to spend

[00:11:07] for zenist is I'm making a video like uh
[00:11:10] like marai editing one from our last two
[00:11:12] streams and I think I want to do another
[00:11:14] video on the second channel of just like
[00:11:16] the abyss like the zenist equivalent of
[00:11:19] Abyss when we get there so I think we're
[00:11:20] going to do a bit more zenist after that
[00:11:23] then uh stop traveling dude dude [ __ ]
[00:11:26] you I don't want to okay sorry sorry
[00:11:29] yeah so we're doing those two streams

[00:12:22] cuz people in chat are saying second but
[00:12:24] I they showed it right on the live yeah

[00:55:29] new I don't know but I'm pretty sure
[00:55:30] this isn't new we already saw
[00:55:33] it envisaged
[00:55:42] echoes oh oh oh it's this wait no this
[00:55:46] is actually hype though I don't I don't
[00:55:48] care what anyone says it's actually hype
[00:55:50] being able to do like cuz they'll
[00:55:52] probably expand it to other characters
[00:55:54] that's pretty
[00:55:55] cool Ras ning Wong duuke Chi-Chi
[00:56:01] Jean you need level 90 you need
[00:56:03] friendship
[00:56:15] 8 theuk is like barely noticeable jeans
[00:56:18] is pretty cool ning Wong's is kind of
[00:56:20] whatever CH is cool it's
[00:56:23] ghosts damn I feel like duuke has the
[00:56:25] worst one it's probably the one I want
[00:56:26] the most that is
[00:56:35] cooked anyways that's pretty
[00:56:37] cool all right Jade
[00:56:59] trying to figure out what her
[00:57:03] [ __ ] I don't know I don't understand
[00:57:05] her
[00:57:06] outfit altruism nevertheless tradable
[00:57:09] morality herein authenticated honesty
[00:57:12] soon mortgaged what Serenity put option
[00:57:16] Only Hope hitherto fortified Equity
[00:57:21] pending sponsorship
[00:57:27] what the
[00:57:29] hell um okay I actually looked into her
[00:57:33] kid a little bit before she came
[00:57:35] out
[00:57:37] um so unless they changed anything not
[00:57:41] Sask unless they change anything she's
[00:57:44] uh basically pure fiction blade support
[00:57:47] good for AOE leeches a bit of Life
[00:57:50] followup
[00:57:51] attacks and uh Buffs herself plus gives
[00:57:54] you Buffs to your followup attacker like
[00:57:56] additional like coordinate attack of
[00:57:58] like Quantum and gives you 30 speed flat
[00:58:01] but I have to reread the abilities cuz
[00:58:02] it's been a while basically just a blade
[00:58:05] support or a pure fiction support but if
[00:58:08] you need help with pure fiction sorry
[00:58:10] but mostly just a blade support
[00:58:13] um
[00:58:19] yeah and AOE content like pure fiction
[00:58:28] freck you whale sorry no but like you
[00:58:31] only need to 6K you don't need to 8K
[00:58:33] through fiction anyways we got Jade wait
[00:58:35] she doesn't go on the teamat like you do
[00:58:37] you have any recomendations for how I
[00:58:40] can get ADHD or any hair loss products

[00:59:09] I'm telling
[00:59:11] you 96% of hoyo designs are are
[00:59:14] asymmetrical I think that's their secret
[00:59:16] you do one look one earring one
[00:59:20] glove one blue bosom and one white you
[00:59:25] got like one feather over
[00:59:29] here
[00:59:34] yeah

[01:04:26] something that that gives you like a
[01:04:28] cosmetic if you're high friendship and
[01:04:30] high level is like really good I don't

[01:22:42] rate stranded
[01:22:45] PS This is a [ __ ] five roll Ball by

[01:23:31] base stat there's like it's like a
[01:23:36] yeah can I we see the blade
[01:23:40] video there's no blade
[01:23:49] video 22.3
[01:23:57] H noise of you in I will dispatch of you
[01:24:02] in8 Cycles 300K might be unreachable
[01:24:05] okay I'm sorry
[01:24:07] sorry D who made
[01:24:10] that okay uh let's do the other content
[01:24:13] now where they're actually good like
[01:24:14] that was a that was a bad showing but it
[01:24:16] wasn't their fault okay so I'm kind of
[01:24:18] Ming but for people who actually care uh
[01:24:20] uh Jade is good for AOE like pure
[01:24:22] fiction and for blade that's basically
[01:24:24] it like that's her role there might be
[01:24:26] more AOE coms in the future there might
[01:24:27] be more characters that synergize with
[01:24:28] her in the future but for now that's
[01:24:30] kind of what she does um so she's like
[01:24:32] kind of built for Pure fiction I
[01:24:34] wouldn't use her for mock well you can
[01:24:36] but like I wouldn't like for memory of
[01:24:38] chaos she's usually worse than other
[01:24:40] characters the only time she isn't is
[01:24:42] with blade she's better if you're
[01:24:44] fighting like a three enemy memory of
[01:24:46] chaos like if you're fighting one enemy
[01:24:48] Ron may still better but if you're
[01:24:49] fighting like three or more then Jade
[01:24:51] becomes better uh but for Pure fiction
[01:24:53] she's good
[01:24:57] so isn't Hera Jade's best partner for
[01:25:00] regular content no but for
[01:25:05] um pure fiction yeah you could use hero
[01:25:07] you could use himo you can use others
[01:25:10] I'm actually going to use Hera I'm
[01:25:11] trying to what am I trying to do inter
[01:25:12] terrestrial
[01:25:17] guide okay maybe we will do pure
[01:25:22] fiction what the [ __ ] this guy has a
[01:25:24] better blade build than you a streamable
[01:25:27] [Music]
[01:25:29] link what is this it's
[01:25:32] called pog and it has one
[01:25:36] view it's
[01:25:39] 480p what is
[01:25:41] this you
[01:25:44] fool bro secret blade
[01:25:49] art cycle Swift dispatch
[01:25:57] don't Li me this [ __ ] man don't Li me
[01:26:01] that it's not like a
[01:26:05] that's okay
[01:26:07] unironically this is content where
[01:26:09] blades a good unit okay there's like six
[01:26:11] enemies they're wind weak like oh well
[01:26:14] this thing's not wind we that looks like
[01:26:15] it's one actually maybe it is I I can't
[01:26:17] this the quality is too low that does
[01:26:19] look like wind actually this is like
[01:26:20] where I would use him but your blade
[01:26:22] just [ __ ] sucks you're playing tingu
[01:26:23] and BR like like like get
[01:26:27] Ron oh it's ice yeah that is Ice Still I
[01:26:31] was it's still
[01:26:45] AOE this was during the jingu propaganda
[01:26:48] oh I
[01:26:52] see all right what do you want to wait
[01:26:54] wait wait what the [ __ ] is this pure
[01:26:55] fiction lineup or like the the
[01:26:58] buff after
[01:27:00] attack after an ally attack an enemy
[01:27:03] with a fall attack charges
[01:27:06] whimsicality I know this I know
[01:27:09] whimsicality I've seen this before so
[01:27:12] you want to follow up
[01:27:14] attack uh reduce charging
[01:27:17] points required to trigger rality by
[01:27:19] four and deal damage four more times
[01:27:24] incase ultimate
[01:27:28] okay
[01:27:31] okay okay so this is for full-up
[01:27:34] attackers this is for like alt spammers
[01:27:37] and this is if you don't have followup
[01:27:38] attacks
[01:27:40] probably okay maybe maybe this is just
[01:27:43] always good though but anyways three

[01:44:10] was so I was looking at
[01:44:13] um I was looking at Fang star account

[01:44:17] I've seen in my life cuz she has
[01:44:19] unlimited like stamina but can't clear
[01:44:22] the weekly boss so she can't level
[01:44:23] anything cuz her characters like can't
[01:44:25] clear

[02:30:16] but near perfect rope oh oh oh oh sh to
[02:30:19] Jingo [ __ ] benched do you know why
[02:30:21] you know why cuz if you're playing for
[02:30:22] fun like I am I play blade if you're
[02:30:24] playing for meta I play acaron where the
[02:30:26] [ __ ] does she go oh or Firefly oh [ __ ]
[02:30:29] oh [ __ ] so I'd rather have a mid
[02:30:32] character than a good but not broken
[02:30:36] character I actually like Jing do
[02:30:42] though okay look tier list maker tier
[02:30:44] list maker
[02:30:50] Swift
[02:30:52] [Laughter]
[02:30:56] dispatch what the [ __ ] is
[02:30:59] this wait when did I make this
[02:31:25] anyways uh sorry sorry okay anyways I
[02:31:29] don't know when I made this reset um
[02:31:32] okay wait
[02:31:34] um look look look so like okay you have
[02:31:36] like like meta right you have like
[02:31:38] broken character that's like designed
[02:31:39] for you to pull for them right okay okay
[02:31:41] okay uh where the [ __ ]
[02:31:43] is acon broken okay cool cool cool cool
[02:31:47] cool then you have like
[02:31:51] really strong characters right really
[02:31:53] strong very good they'll carry you
[02:31:55] through some [ __ ] they'll just be like
[02:31:57] solid characters you know these are
[02:31:59] really good okay okay okay okay even
[02:32:02] yeah Kafka Black Swan too Kafka Black
[02:32:04] Swan too well the thing with C they
[02:32:06] don't fit there cuz like look at them
[02:32:07] like come on like buddy like they're
[02:32:09] basically here like look at them sorry
[02:32:11] okay so like there's this right okay
[02:32:12] okay okay but then blade like okay sure
[02:32:15] blade might be like here okay but like
[02:32:17] the thing is because blade
[02:32:20] is
[02:32:20] like because blade okay
[02:32:25] look because look because okay true but
[02:32:29] okay because because look no you're
[02:32:31] actually coping okay I mean like
[02:32:33] whatever because because you could play
[02:32:38] these because you could play these
[02:32:41] characters then playing these is not
[02:32:43] meta it's still good it's still good but
[02:32:45] it's not as like unless there's like
[02:32:46] weakness right it's not as good and so
[02:32:48] because of that going here is more based
[02:32:51] and so because of that he goes there
[02:32:53] does that make sense does that make
[02:32:54] sense like look if if there's like meta
[02:32:57] and then there's like kind of meta but
[02:32:58] not really and then there's not meta The
[02:33:00] Meta would be playing meta or playing
[02:33:02] for fun and blade is for fun so
[02:33:04] therefore he's better than the like half
[02:33:06] meta characters true true true
[02:33:09] okay also right now it's break
[02:33:11] propaganda so lowkey that but anyways I
[02:33:17] digress I'm too sober for this
[02:33:21] drink is Blade the Shia of HSR okay
[02:33:24] don't do that because Shia is actually
[02:33:25] really good and people act like he isn't
[02:33:27] because I love him look I love Shia and
[02:33:29] I love blade equally but I'm honest
[02:33:31] about both blade he's seen better days
[02:33:33] Shia it's his best day it's he's
[02:33:36] literally like if you have best team

[05:17:12] with a luxury Airship about this

[05:17:19] named the radiant felspar belongs to the
[05:17:21] alala family this conference between the
[05:17:24] IPC and the family will have a direct
[05:17:27] impact on penton's future such an
[05:17:30] important event should have been held as
[05:17:33] it
[05:17:35] well somewhere secretive in the moment
[05:17:38] of morning Jew

[05:17:41] here it doesn't feel serious
[05:17:44] enough if I'm right this conference is
[05:17:48] probably just a Prelude whoever
[05:17:51] organized it wants to assess the IPC
[05:17:53] stance
[05:17:55] beforehand this influential figure

[05:25:17] squabble the way I handled the urillo
[05:25:19] case was approved by Senior Management
[05:25:22] and all of the project logs and calls
[05:25:24] are complete can't you check on them
[05:25:27] yourselves I just don't understand why
[05:25:30] are you so fixated on this minor case
[05:25:32] and constantly escalating it I seriously
[05:25:37] what's your purpose
[05:25:39] sounds
[05:25:40] exhausting why not just hang

[05:25:59] Department it's been a while little yena
[05:26:02] I my OBS what is happening forward to
[05:26:04] working with you never imagined this day
[05:26:07] would come so soon
[05:26:09] soon is there
[05:26:11] trouble you can tell me
[05:26:14] anything just like old
[05:26:16] times ah it's been a while Madam Jade
[05:26:20] I'm honored to have the opportunity to
[05:26:22] work with what was that you're still so
[05:26:25] formal aren't
[05:26:26] you forget about the hierarchy and treat
[05:26:29] me as your equal no need for Unnecessary
[05:26:32] titles like
[05:26:36] Madam I'm sorry but it might take some
[05:26:39] time to get used to that after all you
[05:26:42] are a
[05:26:45] senior now that we're both members of
[05:26:48] stoneharts I need you to be at your best
[05:26:51] especially since the upcoming
[05:26:53] negotiations leave no room for
[05:26:55] error as sharp as you are I'm sure You'
[05:26:59] figured out the true purpose of this
[05:27:01] conference right I believe old ODOT has
[05:27:05] taken it upon himself to test our limits
[05:27:08] dude OT is such a before the official
[05:27:10] negotiations between the IPC and panone
[05:27:13] okay no disrespect if your name or
[05:27:16] someone you know is called OT but what a
[05:27:18] [ __ ] name I'm sorry what the [ __ ] is OT
[05:27:21] that's true and it works in our
[05:27:24] favor do you know why if we can reach
[05:27:27] some s agreement with old ODOT
[05:27:29] beforehand and Stage our opponent's
[05:27:33] boundaries our future negotiations will
[05:27:35] go much more smoothly also dude that's
[05:27:38] the while while that NPC was yapping I
[05:27:41] forgot to change my OBS scene but I was
[05:27:42] trying to do the whle and I guessed
[05:27:44] cream and it was actually pretty good so
[05:27:46] it might be like C
[05:27:49] camel oh
[05:27:55] my wait
[05:27:56] what
[05:28:01] camon wait wait wait I'll find it
[05:28:08] oh Cameo Cameo I just spit everywhere oh
[05:28:12] nice
[05:28:13] exactly and the hidden benefit is that
[05:28:17] as the head of the alala family his
[05:28:19] action suggests that the five lineages
[05:28:22] might not be as United as the ODS of
[05:28:24] Harmony would suggest as long as the
[05:28:26] influence of Harmony hasn't completely
[05:28:29] permeated their core personal desires
[05:28:32] will always have their
[05:28:34] way thankfully influential figures in
[05:28:37] pentacon haven't entirely suppressed
[05:28:39] their own desires okay similar to the
[05:28:42] power struggles within the
[05:28:44] IPC the supposed all for one philosophy
[05:28:47] all for one my hero
[05:28:51] Academia sorry Master has gone after the
[05:28:54] downfall of the Yoke family old ot's
[05:28:57] faction became the dominant force in
[05:28:59] pentacon even if we consider only the
[05:29:02] succession order he's the longest
[05:29:04] serving and most senior among all the
[05:29:06] family heads yes yes that's exactly why
[05:29:09] we need to following an agreed strategy
[05:29:12] d i could be Jade it's like playing a
[05:29:15] game of chess where every move needs to
[05:29:18] be cared dude one day I'm going to voice
[05:29:19] an NPC and you be like holy [ __ ] Z I
[05:29:21] didn't know you had that in you you have
[05:29:23] such good
[05:29:24] range absolutely the three steps of
[05:29:28] negotiation listen test and strike I
[05:29:31] don't think those are the actual steps
[05:29:33] of negotiation but pretty clear although
[05:29:37] you seem to have changed the listen test
[05:29:40] strike that was based on my personal
[05:29:43] experience I apologize for interrupting
[05:29:46] your conversation but the family head is
[05:29:49] time to get to work let's prepare
[05:29:51] ourselves and meet that esteemed

[05:31:43] my honor to meet you in person you may
[05:31:46] not be aware but the book OD alala the
[05:31:50] biography is a mustre for all Strategic
[05:31:53] investment Department employees after
[05:31:55] all to many you are the legendary figure
[05:31:58] who single-handedly built the pentacon
[05:32:02] economy I expected no less from the 10
[05:32:05] stone hearts from the Strategic invest M
[05:32:08] Department you're definitely skilled in
[05:32:11] the art of
[05:32:12] conversation I always enjoy talking to
[05:32:15] smart people because we don't have to
[05:32:18] beat around the bush we can just get
[05:32:21] straight to the point
[05:32:23] instead since I enjoy talking to smart
[05:32:26] people because we don't have to beat
[05:32:28] around the bush I'm sure You' figured
[05:32:31] out the topic I'd like to discuss
[05:32:35] yes the future of pentacon if I'm not
[05:32:40] mistaken precisely those few words
[05:32:44] represent a terribly complicated
[05:32:46] situation indeed let's take that
[05:32:48] golden-haired guy who's not showing up
[05:32:50] for example Aventure put in great effort
[05:32:53] and almost got himself killed but what
[05:32:56] was it all for wasn't it eventually to
[05:32:59] create an opportunity for you IPC to
[05:33:01] regain control of the precious
[05:33:05] aana the wisdom and experience youve
[05:33:07] accumulated over 10 are truly
[05:33:11] impressive this might be my worst take
[05:33:13] of all time but he might be my
[05:33:18] favorite okay it's between him and
[05:33:21] Sparkle but he might be my favorite
[05:33:22] pentony
[05:33:24] character I think trying to think of who
[05:33:27] else at least like from the quest we've
[05:33:29] seen that was really
[05:33:32] good dude he's [ __ ]
[05:33:35] sick let's assume your assumptions are
[05:33:38] correct comment take I mean I guess he
[05:33:39] is popular how would you respond to the
[05:33:42] ipc's
[05:33:44] actions I appreciate your composure Miss
[05:33:47] Jade you must have witnessed much in
[05:33:50] your worldly
[05:33:51] experiences however perhaps you don't
[05:33:54] know much about pen appreci
[05:33:58] you old OT won't sit idly by when faced
[05:34:01] with a greedy I don't play got you
[05:34:03] anymore but as asked quick question what
[05:34:05] is Amber era Amber era so Amber is a
[05:34:07] three star lyone and honkai star it's
[05:34:09] also a gem a stone but uh what the Ember
[05:34:12] refers to is
[05:34:14] maybe around two years ago when people
[05:34:16] discovered that Amber with elgy for the
[05:34:18] end could be a good uh useful support in
[05:34:21] a double Pyro huta Team uh VV Vape
[05:34:24] because Hut can't apply Pyro from uh
[05:34:27] without using her skill which has a long
[05:34:28] cool down and so you don't want to do
[05:34:30] that right so you could set up by using
[05:34:32] Amber uh her e or her Q or whatever
[05:34:34] usually her Q actually uh and then you
[05:34:36] would not her e and then you would uh
[05:34:38] swirl that with elgy for the end and be
[05:34:40] a good
[05:34:49] support please go ahead I'm all
[05:34:55] ears then I'll be doesn't red nose in uh
[05:34:58] in like anime it means they're drunk no
[05:35:01] is that a thing to dissuade the or does
[05:35:03] he just have like makeup Department from
[05:35:05] trying to lay a finger on pacle
[05:35:11] if you back off now you can make a
[05:35:14] smooth exit and prevent the
[05:35:17] IPC face during more important
[05:35:21] negotiations okay I don't think it's
[05:35:23] pronounced negotiations but all
[05:35:25] good one of our p45 Executives was
[05:35:29] attacked and nearly killed in the
[05:35:31] Dreamscape the IPC can't simply ignore
[05:35:34] this incident moreover consider during
[05:35:37] the turbulence during the charmony
[05:35:39] festival picone's credibility has taken
[05:35:42] a hit in the Public's
[05:35:47] eyes
[05:35:49] right despite your determined attitude
[05:35:52] the issues pling pentacon are real are
[05:35:56] they
[05:35:58] not you use the term real M topz but
[05:36:02] let's not forget that this is the realm
[05:36:05] of okay no shade this might be the most
[05:36:07] boring conversation of all time but old
[05:36:09] OT looks cool at
[05:36:12] least I'm getting flashbacks of like my
[05:36:15] University lectures man the
[05:36:17] IPC well I don't mind
[05:36:20] sharing my actions will help pan take a
[05:36:23] significant step forward by self-
[05:36:26] listing oh it's the [ __ ] it's trial
[05:36:28] it's the whale from the the abyss
[05:36:31] public if I'm not mistaken you want to
[05:36:35] bypass the IPC and go public on a
[05:36:38] universal scale
[05:36:40] precisely instead of watching the IPC no
[05:36:44] it's you okay you can't even make that
[05:36:46] joke cuz my star is like actually like
[05:36:49] I'm using an S3 [ __ ] eyes of prey on
[05:36:53] Black Swan starting today anyone in the
[05:36:56] cosmos can become a shareholder of the
[05:36:59] land of the dreams hey public company I
[05:37:01] get it PA of Harmony I'll choose
[05:37:09] this reform should have been implemented
[05:37:12] earlier but
[05:37:14] unfortunately the oak family were a
[05:37:16] bunch of Blockheads blinded by
[05:37:19] order their level of intellectual
[05:37:22] flexibility doesn't even come close to
[05:37:24] an old fellow like me okay thanks to the
[05:37:28] little reverberation earlier the biggest
[05:37:32] obstacle between me and my reforms has
[05:37:35] been eliminated
[05:37:38] the Alfalfa family will publicize the
[05:37:41] financial results of sweet dream
[05:37:44] Paradise so that the entire universe can
[05:37:47] see that despite the catastrophe penacon
[05:37:51] still holds immense potential and
[05:37:54] opportunities and that the family
[05:37:56] remains confident in its
[05:38:01] future H crisis and opportunity are two
[05:38:05] sides of the same coin
[05:38:08] so you've been waiting for the right
[05:38:10] moment for penone to regain the
[05:38:12] spotlight and if penone should seize
[05:38:15] this opportunity to overcome adversity
[05:38:18] even if the IPC tries to intervene every
[05:38:21] move we make will be scrutinized by
[05:38:23] trillions of people I don't think
[05:38:24] there's trillions of people it's
[05:38:26] billions but it's it's okay Jade I mean
[05:38:28] you don't need to know that it's fine
[05:38:30] convinced that you've indeed familiarize
[05:38:32] yourself with my biography Miss Jade so
[05:38:37] about your your next move please
[05:38:40] consider it carefully you see as a child
[05:38:44] we need a Charmy Dove flew into my
[05:38:50] backyard I suggest we conclude the first
[05:38:52] half of our conference Mr alala please
[05:38:55] allow topz and me to confer privately
[05:38:57] for a few moments and to respond on
[05:39:00] behalf of the IPC
[05:39:04] later of course take your time hi dear
[05:39:12] ladies the [ __ ] says Dear
[05:39:16] ladies Trail baser POV thank God family
[05:39:19] had a meeting with the oh my God it's
[05:39:20] Dan hung I got this information from a
[05:39:23] message sent by that IPC Ambassador you
[05:39:25] heard Firefly talking about blade turn
[05:39:28] to favor where is he it's not hard to
[05:39:30] imagine pent we have a score to SLE
[05:39:33] pretty much like the frontier prison it
[05:39:35] once was with external forces casting
[05:39:39] greedy eyes and the undercurrent of
[05:39:41] order lurking within instead of falling
[05:39:44] into a situation where they are plagued
[05:39:47] by both external and internal threats
[05:39:50] penone would rather take a step back and
[05:39:53] invite the IPC to negotiate at the table
[05:39:57] ostensibly to cooperate but in reality
[05:40:01] to secure more opportunities for their
[05:40:03] own Survival well no wonder they sought
[05:40:06] the mediation from the astral
[05:40:08] Express in your opinion who should we
[05:40:11] stand behind I don't think the followers
[05:40:14] of the harmony are completely innocent
[05:40:17] victims in all of this man [ __ ] the
[05:40:19] harmony followers they have a strong
[05:40:21] desire to smooth things over which leads
[05:40:24] to speculation about their motives if
[05:40:27] either the family or IPC were to assume
[05:40:30] full control and [ __ ] the order it would
[05:40:33] return illusory dream of hedonism and
[05:40:37] theism I know what that word
[05:40:40] meansis once again go to waste the
[05:40:43] ethical theory that pleasure is the
[05:40:45] highest good and oh wait I learned about
[05:40:47] this the highest good and proper aim of
[05:40:49] human
[05:40:57] life pleasure in the sense of
[05:40:59] satisfaction of
[05:41:04] desires there you are did you rest well
[05:41:10] I mean yeah it is the the gacha gacha
[05:41:13] player mentality I didn't disturb you
[05:41:16] since you were in a bigger number better
[05:41:18] person
[05:41:20] okay feel like a a long dream where is
[05:41:22] himo ah she went to negotiate with the
[05:41:25] family as a representative of the crew
[05:41:28] she'll contact us once her arrangements
[05:41:31] are
[05:41:32] ready after Anna's dream was shattered
[05:41:36] the family branch from the Montour
[05:41:38] system soon arrived and swiftly took
[05:41:40] control of the situation most members of
[05:41:43] the oak family fell unconscious but
[05:41:46] fortunately their lives were not in
[05:41:49] danger The Mastermind behind the plans
[05:41:51] was confirmed to be goer wood the
[05:41:54] previous dream
[05:41:56] master but by the time we arrived he I
[05:41:59] forgot about gopher wood
[05:42:02] ready what about Sunday he'll face a
[05:42:05] trial
[05:42:07] as for further
[05:42:09] details the family would rather not
[05:42:11] disclose them ultimately the public
[05:42:14] perceived the incident as an attack by
[05:42:16] evil forces targeting the Charmy
[05:42:19] Festival they believe the family failed
[05:42:21] to safeguard the sweet dream
[05:42:24] significantly eroding their credibility
[05:42:26] in the process okay while quite
[05:42:29] different from the truth impact this
[05:42:31] appears to be the outcome with the least
[05:42:33] impact after all you don't know who's
[05:42:36] awake and who pretending to be wait

[05:43:32] astral Express leave
[05:43:34] Pentagon we'll stay a bit longer but not
[05:43:38] too
[05:43:39] long so this is our final meeting then
[05:43:43] if this is a farewell then it seems to
[05:43:45] be missing something
[05:43:48] music
[05:43:50] Atmosphere ah maybe a special drink to
[05:43:52] honor those who are not
[05:43:54] here wait should Gallagher make the
[05:43:56] drink mix drink should be yo let's let's
[05:43:58] call dignified and unique as we'll use
[05:44:03] it to pay respect to those fallen heroes
[05:44:05] to the nameless resting in oh [ __ ] oh
[05:44:11] [ __ ] oh

[05:44:17] what oh
[05:44:20] [ __ ] wait what the [ __ ] is
[05:44:24] LTI chat with your fellow members of the
[05:44:26] crew
[05:44:28] honestly kind of don't want to ready to
[05:44:30] mix your drink yeah what happened to
[05:44:33] Gallagher oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ]
[05:44:38] oh I'm not sure I haven't seen him since
[05:44:41] our last meeting at the
[05:44:43] lounge come to think of it he always did
[05:44:46] come and go quietly we used to discuss
[05:44:49] everything here but every time he'd
[05:44:51] leave I'd realize that I didn't know him
[05:44:53] at
[05:44:54] all such is the mystery that is
[05:44:57] Gallagher I have a
[05:44:59] hunch perhaps he's already fulfilled his
[05:45:02] wishes and won't be coming back well
[05:45:07] let's make the drink before we start uh
[05:45:09] would you like to talk to your friends
[05:45:10] okay they really want me to talk to my
[05:45:12] friends okay what do they say something
[05:45:14] important why do you want me to talk to
[05:45:15] them so bad it's rare for all passengers
[05:45:17] to leave the express together during a
[05:45:23] trailblaze what happened my dream the
[05:45:26] express stopped at many places and
[05:45:29] passengers came and
[05:45:31] went however the five of us were always
[05:45:34] present and the journey seemed to never
[05:45:37] ending march talks about something
[05:45:39] interesting like I said well I didn't
[05:45:41] even see March where the [ __ ] is March
[05:45:43] oh my God she's why is she over there
[05:45:46] bro what are you
[05:45:49] doing guess what something weird just
[05:45:52] happened when I was on my way over here
[05:45:54] so I unwrapped it and found out it was a
[05:45:57] button with a message on the back just
[05:46:01] press this button and all of penacon
[05:46:03] will explode sounds terrifying
[05:46:08] could you did you press it of course not
[05:46:11] who would press something like that by
[05:46:13] the time I turned around the person had
[05:46:16] already vanished so I handed it over to
[05:46:19] a nearby Hound I heard there were many
[05:46:22] similar reports before the Charmy
[05:46:24] Festival started what if Sparkle trying
[05:46:25] to get them all to the hounds I'm really
[05:46:29] wor also okay I know I skipped the event

[05:46:34] most events okay let it go ready to mix
[05:46:37] your drink I mixed I missed
[05:46:41] one before we start all right as you

[05:46:48] what drink to make would you uh let's do

[05:46:54] popular drink in this bar it's bitter

[05:47:01] life not a bad choice let's start
[05:47:05] mixing dude Alan made us try like me and

[05:47:27] tasted like my whole body was burning it
[05:47:30] was like a tequila shot but like six
[05:47:33] times stronger and I like it was like
[05:47:35] probably the worst thing I've ever never
[05:47:36] put in my mouth but it's okay and I took
[05:47:39] another sip cuz I was
[05:47:45] bored Bros never had moonshine okay
[05:47:47] unironically I think it's worse than
[05:47:51] moonshine cuz like it wasn't just strong
[05:47:54] it also tasted
[05:47:58] bad anyways
[05:48:01] um puffer goat milk traditional Mung

[05:48:54] memories and emotions together and well
[05:48:58] through the filter of time what remains
[05:49:01] in the glass is something to savor well
[05:49:04] it's done here's to the the nameless
[05:49:07] resting in peace and to my friend
[05:49:11] Gallagher death is a bitter truth but
[05:49:14] what you did will be remembered by
[05:49:16] history we're not accepted by the
[05:49:17] outside world so we've gathered here and
[05:49:21] one day our souls will return to the
[05:49:24] same place cheers

[05:49:32] message oh heo

[05:49:43] charge by the way what are you doing

[05:50:07] thirsty fixed more of this last special
[05:50:09] drink for
[05:50:11] you the past shouldn't be
[05:50:13] forgotten so I hope it brings back the
[05:50:16] flavors of pentacon thank you I I'm sure
[05:50:19] it'll leave a lasting
[05:50:21] impression if you happen to run into
[05:50:24] Gallagher make sure he has a sip too I
[05:50:27] know his tastes and cuz we have yeah we
[05:50:30] have heo brewing coffee for us like in
[05:50:32] the morning but I feel like at some
[05:50:33] point maybe give it like uh give it like
[05:50:35] one or two more like pit stops he like
[05:50:38] there might not be anyone left to make a
[05:50:40] coffee for us so having someone that can
[05:50:41] also make drinks might be nice we will
[05:50:43] all right enough with the heavy stuff
[05:50:46] you guys have important things to take
[05:50:48] care of so let's not dwell on things
[05:50:52] whether it's the astral Express or
[05:50:54] pentacon there's still a long journey
[05:50:56] ahead and Embark towards our
[05:51:01] tomorrows switching to Jade's
[05:51:03] POV old OTE is a tricky opponent I
[05:51:07] didn't expect him to take the risky step
[05:51:10] of going public at such a critical
[05:51:12] moment for
[05:51:14] pentacon indeed he's definitely bold
[05:51:18] it's that kind of boldness that made him
[05:51:20] the OD Al falfa he is today still the
[05:51:24] outcome is uncertain shouting loud
[05:51:27] doesn't necessarily carry any
[05:51:30] weight what about the phone call I asked
[05:51:32] you to make topaz ah they agreed but
[05:51:36] it'll take some time before they arrive
[05:51:39] just as it should be the sweet Dew
[05:51:42] should be served after the bitter
[05:51:45] poison looks like we'll be skipping the
[05:51:48] exchanging apples step this time
[05:51:51] around now that we're dealing with a
[05:51:54] greedy Merchant a simple apple wouldn't
[05:51:56] make a difference well I guess I
[05:51:59] included myself in that remark too dude
[05:52:02] why the [ __ ] does she have a okay why
[05:52:05] does she have a strap here like what
[05:52:07] like what is the point of that I feel
[05:52:08] like that does nothing now I'm a bit
[05:52:10] curious topaz do you think pentacon is a
[05:52:14] quality
[05:52:15] asset yes despite its recent Calamity
[05:52:19] panone remains a top quality asset
[05:52:21] within the cosmos with uh good credit
[05:52:25] lucrative potential and uh promising
[05:52:28] prospects well that's obvious but what I
[05:52:31] truly wanted to know is wait this
[05:52:33] project is obviously too bland for your
[05:52:36] taste
[05:52:37] isn't
[05:52:38] it that's true I wouldn't be here if it
[05:52:41] weren't for a venturine but despite that
[05:52:45] you trust him you even entrusted him
[05:52:48] with a
[05:52:49] Cornerstone something as precious as
[05:52:51] life itself uh are you not in the same
[05:52:54] boat Miss Jade is this Quest good so far
[05:52:57] please ask me again in an hour your Jade
[05:52:59] stone wouldn't have made it across the
[05:53:02] border
[05:53:03] so allowing you to see all desires that
[05:53:06] flow through dreams to gain a bargaining
[05:53:08] chip in
[05:53:10] negotiations that's why I'm willing to
[05:53:12] stake my topest stone to cover for you
[05:53:15] once that kid sets his mind to something
[05:53:17] nothing can stop him not even
[05:53:21] fate well at least he's still alive and
[05:53:25] that's the best outcome bro has Zoomer
[05:53:27] brain bro they're talking about ping a
[05:53:29] company and [ __ ] how what do you want me
[05:53:31] to do like I retain the information but
[05:53:33] it's either going to pay off in two
[05:53:35] hours or not but like for now it's just
[05:53:39] okay we've straighted off topic Miss
[05:53:41] Jade should we discuss our next steps no
[05:53:44] need I'll go It Alone meanwhile you can
[05:53:49] go greet our honored guest and wait for
[05:53:51] my message

[05:54:24] bird I think I hear
[05:54:30] something why is there no command for
[05:54:32] the Fate B accident honestly we could
[05:54:34] make that a command
[05:54:36] hi

[05:54:41] expect to you here Jade low key stay
[05:54:43] away from her Jade

[05:54:58] my way to meet him right now Alfalfa do
[05:55:01] you know him well miss Robin
[05:55:09] unfortunately I've never met him I've
[05:55:12] only heard a few comments from the
[05:55:14] former head of the oak
[05:55:16] family Mr Alfalfa is respectable when it
[05:55:19] comes to business but in other respects
[05:55:23] I can't say the
[05:55:25] same where do you think the future of
[05:55:28] the planet of festivities is headed I
[05:55:30] believe the sweet dream will see its
[05:55:33] rebirth just like the radiant felt
[05:55:36] resumed its Voyage the harmony needs a
[05:55:39] new
[05:55:39] Direction only by bidding farewell to
[05:55:42] the Past can we actually sail into the
[05:55:44] future there are no permanent allies or
[05:55:47] Everlasting
[05:55:49] enemies so let's both take what we need
[05:55:53] from this deal
[05:55:55] naturally I'm looking forward to your
[05:55:57] performance see you later miss

[05:56:35] care of okay you'll be seeing her later
[05:56:39] talks can still continue between the two
[05:56:40] of us is it just me miss your tone
[05:56:44] sounds very different now I need to set
[05:56:48] a good example for my junior it's not a
[05:56:51] good habit to be too loose lipped during
[05:56:54] negotiations right now we can speak
[05:56:56] frankly and openly do you believe what I
[05:56:59] said OD you're not the only Merchant who
[05:57:02] has seen the changes in the cosmic
[05:57:04] Market over the past past 10 Amber eras
[05:57:10] interesting now that's she's interesting
[05:57:13] good it's good to be straightforward
[05:57:17] openness and transparency are my things
[05:57:20] so tell me what's your next move
[05:57:24] unfortunately I'd like to speak the
[05:57:26] harsh truth before laying out my
[05:57:29] plan let's cut to the
[05:57:32] chase first your plan won't work penacon
[05:57:36] has no way of sidest stepping the IPC
[05:57:39] and going public second you can't stop
[05:57:42] the IP entering
[05:57:45] penacon we've got all the time and
[05:57:48] Connections in the world to find a way
[05:57:50] in we'll keep tearing down and
[05:57:52] rebuilding this place until the asdon
[05:57:55] system gets used to the ipc's ways again
[05:57:57] now I'm repeating your words
[05:58:00] exactly if you don't want to be a
[05:58:03] laughing stalk and have everyone gunning
[05:58:05] for you at the official official
[05:58:07] conference you'd better drop your little
[05:58:09] pie in the sky
[05:58:14] plan interesting you surely have a way
[05:58:17] with words now I'm curious to know what
[05:58:20] you dude this guy's past eight lines of
[05:58:23] dialogue keep like wo interesting Mr
[05:58:26] alala let's not forget that the IPC
[05:58:29] controls the biggest Interstellar
[05:58:31] publicity
[05:58:33] platform more than half the news works
[05:58:36] in the universe if he says it again I'm
[05:58:38] going to lose my [ __ ] the moment news
[05:58:40] spreads about pentacon going public
[05:58:43] trillions of customers will immediately
[05:58:45] receive a message like this the family's
[05:58:48] protection for pentacon has expired any
[05:58:51] mishaps in the Dreamscape could result
[05:58:54] in permanent brain death permanent brain
[05:59:04] death care to guess
[05:59:06] how many way I'm too tired to make it to
[05:59:08] find a functioning joke worthless junk
[05:59:11] within aasly 24 system hours there's a
[05:59:15] joke with Ming a certain character there
[05:59:16] I just couldn't think of one keeping a
[05:59:18] close eye on penone I you really think
[05:59:22] you can pull that off I didn't mean to
[05:59:24] click that fast
[05:59:25] sorry when the entire cos close p i sure
[05:59:28] you won't be that
[05:59:30] hard even from peer Point as distant as
[05:59:33] it may be I'm more than capable of
[05:59:35] keeping keeping you on a tight
[05:59:38] leash however if you agree to give up
[05:59:41] that half-baked plan to go public the
[05:59:44] IPC will assure you that we'll never
[05:59:47] jeopardize the interests of the family
[05:59:49] heads under your leadership after all we
[05:59:52] also need allies here in
[05:59:54] oana the IPC can assist penacon with
[05:59:57] financing starting by acquiring 30%
[06:00:01] Equity shares 30% Equity you say who can
[06:00:08] that's the brilliant part of it all the
[06:00:11] answer is simple no one there are no
[06:00:15] guarantees it all hinges on
[06:00:18] self-awareness and mutual
[06:00:20] respect however the board of directors
[06:00:23] will consider the interests of the
[06:00:24] family heads to some extent you're a
[06:00:27] smart Merchant old ODI isn't the whole
[06:00:30] purpose of this elaborate game to
[06:00:31] Showcase your business acony and seek
[06:00:34] more benefits for the family
[06:00:36] it benefits us if we both take a step
[06:00:40] back and if that's not enough for you
[06:00:43] I'm pretty sure that another goal of
[06:00:45] making pentacon go public is to expand
[06:00:47] the influence of the planet of
[06:00:49] festivities and attract more
[06:00:51] customers I understand your concern and
[06:00:55] I have a solution for that too fine now
[06:00:59] I see your sincerity sincerity as the
[06:01:02] head of the alala family I don't think I
[06:01:06] have any reason to refuse your offer
[06:01:09] however as their chosen one I still need
[06:01:14] one final answer go ahead I'm listening
[06:01:19] when I was a child I heard the adults
[06:01:22] recite the tale of the ancient Amber era
[06:01:27] about the Ascension of sheipe the har
[06:01:31] and the downfall of Anna the order and
[06:01:35] the preservation used to be close in
[06:01:37] ancient
[06:01:39] times so why does the
[06:01:43] IPC as a follower of the Amber Lord seek
[06:01:47] collaboration with the family instead of
[06:01:51] aligning with the order okay good
[06:01:53] question the answer is simpler than you
[06:01:55] think it's all about credits everyone's
[06:01:59] favorite thing in the universally
[06:02:00] recognized currency Among the Stars the
[06:02:03] IPC has the power to perpetually ensure
[06:02:07] their value with each new world
[06:02:10] integrated into the credit system the
[06:02:12] IPC adds another building to its cause
[06:02:16] eventually all exchanges capital and
[06:02:19] businesses will operate within a unified
[06:02:21] monetary system by then all planetary
[06:02:25] developments will be recorded in
[06:02:26] accounts with well-defined values and
[06:02:29] the ability for exchange and circulation
[06:02:36] and then the IPC will be able to exert
[06:02:39] influence over
[06:02:41] everything Our intention is to establish
[06:02:44] enduring
[06:02:45] preservation so I'm sure you can
[06:02:48] understand this universe doesn't need
[06:02:51] two types of
[06:02:55] order you think Jade sells nfts now
[06:02:58] you've convinced me all right tell me
[06:03:01] your solution let's see if we're
[06:03:04] thinking the same thing
[06:03:06] then let's continue our
[06:03:08] conversation more
[06:03:15] convers oh hi
[06:03:19] himo thank you for your presence Miss
[06:03:22] himo please allow me to introduce her to
[06:03:25] you Mr
[06:03:26] alala this is Miss himo from the astral
[06:03:29] Express one of the future shareholders
[06:03:32] of pentacon I've heard so much about you
[06:03:35] Mr alfalfa
[06:03:36] it's an honor to meet you as
[06:03:38] representative of the astral
[06:03:41] Express this stunning lady is the
[06:03:43] Navigator of the astral
[06:03:46] Express I believe everyone here is
[06:03:49] familiar with the general contents of
[06:03:50] The
[06:03:51] Proposal after this round of financing
[06:03:54] the IPC is expected to hold 30% of
[06:03:57] penacon shares then the IPC will
[06:04:01] transfer 5% of that stake to the astral
[06:04:04] Express okay recommend Miss heo as an
[06:04:07] independent director to honor the
[06:04:09] sacrifices and contributions made by the
[06:04:12] former nameless to the land of the
[06:04:15] dreams okay while this decision isn't
[06:04:17] finalized yet we are honored that
[06:04:19] everyone here recognizes the way of the
[06:04:22] trailblaze while the nameless didn't
[06:04:24] embark on their Journeys for fame or
[06:04:26] Fortune if this is the wish of both the
[06:04:28] family and the IPC I will represent the
[06:04:31] asteral express and fulfill my duty as a
[06:04:34] member of the board of directors
[06:04:36] the entire crew has agreed to assist in
[06:04:38] the Reconstruction of pentacon beyond
[06:04:41] that in our future travels we are
[06:04:43] committed to bringing the beautiful
[06:04:44] dreams of the planet of festivities to
[06:04:46] more worlds of course all cooperation is
[06:04:50] based on one premise the path of Harmony
[06:04:52] in pentacon must not be distorted again
[06:04:56] and such a tragedy must never recur okay

[06:36:46] now
[06:36:48] of
[06:36:50] cake
[06:36:55] Jade so you're back Miss
[06:36:59] Samuel
[06:37:01] yeah I found those people
[06:37:04] and it seems their wishes did come true
[06:37:06] after visiting the bonate exchange but
[06:37:09] I'm not sure what you want me to see not
[06:37:12] so fast this step was just to show you
[06:37:15] that the bonade exchange is genuine that
[06:37:18] I had the power to grant their wishes
[06:37:21] and now I'll tell you the that to sign a
[06:37:23] contract that's why in her Al there's a
[06:37:25] contract you have to sign your life D
[06:37:28] was from a wealthy family he was head
[06:37:31] over heels for Dorothy wanted to win her
[06:37:34] so I ate his parents so he made a deal
[06:37:36] with me he put up his entire fortune in
[06:37:40] exchange for a gift that would impress
[06:37:42] Dorothy
[06:37:54] [Music]
[06:38:04] [Music]
[06:38:16] okay sorry was a piece of cake for me
[06:38:20] thanks to my IPC connections however
[06:38:23] Dell will soon find himself evicted from
[06:38:26] the
[06:38:27] Dreamscape he can't afford his room
[06:38:30] whether he can bounce back from poverty
[06:38:32] well
[06:38:33] that depends on him
[06:38:37] oh wait if you're from a okay wait a
[06:38:39] second not to be a
[06:38:42] [ __ ] not to be that guy but if you're
[06:38:45] from a wealthy
[06:38:48] family wouldn't you rather just get your
[06:38:50] money up then get your funny up why
[06:38:52] would you give it all away for a [ __ ]
[06:39:01] like let's just hope that neckace will
[06:39:03] keep the relationship from
[06:39:05] crumbling then there's Stacy a lady with
[06:39:08] a gambling addiction she wanted some
[06:39:12] serious luck but she had nothing to
[06:39:15] offer so I took something else instead I
[06:39:18] took away all her close
[06:39:20] relationships from the moment she
[06:39:22] stepped out of the bonade exchange every
[06:39:25] Casino in the cosmos would oh that's
[06:39:27] worth her name but her parents C6
[06:39:30] [ __ ] acaron in one Temple but I don't
[06:39:33] have friends okay so nothing changes
[06:39:36] except I'm lucky that's a net
[06:39:40] positive she will AC a vast wealth due
[06:39:43] to her good luck but she'll never be
[06:39:46] able to use it for the people who truly
[06:39:48] matter to her as for detective Walker he
[06:39:52] spent two decades chasing down a wanted
[06:39:55] criminal for some heinous crime but he
[06:39:58] never caught the guy in his desperation
[06:40:02] he came to me he offered his own memory
[06:40:05] system as
[06:40:06] collateral in due time his memories as a
[06:40:10] detective will be erased and he will
[06:40:13] completely forget his own ID all the
[06:40:16] sacrifices he has made interesting don't
[06:40:18] you think I fulfill people's desires and
[06:40:21] Grant them favors and soon they come
[06:40:24] back to me with even greater desires
[06:40:26] when people see others desires get
[06:40:28] fulfilled they develop their own desires
[06:40:32] it seems like an end cycle but it does I
[06:40:35] feel like learning all this about Jade
[06:40:37] is kind of like I will get what I I feel
[06:40:39] like it's irrelevant if Firefly just
[06:40:41] says oh I'll pass then and then walks
[06:40:44] away but I feel like because we learned
[06:40:46] all this useless lore sorry not to upset
[06:40:49] the lore for this amazing lore I feel
[06:40:52] like Firefly is going to be like yeah
[06:40:54] actually I want to live and then she's
[06:40:55] going to bet like her leg and patience
[06:40:59] happens to be one of my greatest
[06:41:01] strengths so now now do you understand
[06:41:05] what you must give up Miss Samuel or
[06:41:07] should I address you
[06:41:10] as AR
[06:41:13] 26710 what the a Remnant what the how do
[06:41:16] you know did she watch the animated
[06:41:20] short I'm not
[06:41:22] surprised you are much calmer than I
[06:41:27] expected entropy loss
[06:41:30] syndrome truly an unjust misfortune
[06:41:33] isn't it the hups in gloth implemented
[06:41:37] such a fail safe within the genes of
[06:41:38] their
[06:41:40] Warriors just to make sure the
[06:41:42] Republic's most powerful weapons
[06:41:45] wouldn't fall into the wrong hand what
[06:41:46] the [ __ ] as for the price those iron
[06:41:51] cavalries weren't exactly seen as
[06:41:53] regular independent humans so there
[06:41:56] wasn't really a price to be
[06:41:58] paid however you are different your a
[06:42:03] stellon hunter a living being named
[06:42:07] Firefly naturally you want to continue
[06:42:10] your existence but with the firmament
[06:42:12] front gone the people who know the
[06:42:15] secret and can cure the disease are
[06:42:17] nowhere to be found uhoh are you
[06:42:20] suggesting that the IPC has a
[06:42:24] remedy well there might be a silver
[06:42:28] lining that's all I can say for now I
[06:42:31] see
[06:42:33] it's no wonder you said I can't provide
[06:42:35] anything of equal
[06:42:36] value because nothing I own holds any
[06:42:38] meaning damn that's not true Firefly so
[06:42:42] you you hold meaning ask me to
[06:42:44] personally restrain my partners to
[06:42:46] ensure my own
[06:42:48] Survival unfortunately that's not quite
[06:42:51] the
[06:42:53] case Partners a nice way to put
[06:42:57] it now I'm even more curious about the
[06:42:59] stellon hunters uhoh each of you has
[06:43:02] your Sil when the group chat gets leaked
[06:43:04] bond with each other strong and intimate
[06:43:07] oh Fu get it allows for Independence
[06:43:10] just as the 10 ston Hearts follow
[06:43:12] Diamond you follow your own
[06:43:15] leader I wonder what they are like and
[06:43:18] if all stellon Hunters are like
[06:43:21] you traveling on the path of finality
[06:43:24] but struggling against your destiny
[06:43:27] attempting to move in the opposite
[06:43:30] direction I really hope that one day all
[06:43:34] of you will come and visit my pawn shop
[06:43:37] I'll be waiting patiently for that day
[06:43:39] can I see this as an
[06:43:42] invitation from Diamond to the stellon
[06:43:45] hunters while keeping the IPC in the
[06:43:48] dark consider it more of a personal
[06:43:51] offer from myself it doesn't represent
[06:43:54] the IPC or the Strategic investment
[06:43:58] Department the stellon hunters have
[06:44:01] interacted with the IPC
[06:44:03] but not the 10 stone
[06:44:05] hearts our paths have never crossed wait
[06:44:08] so when Firefly comes out she's going to
[06:44:09] be path of finality and then Sunday is
[06:44:12] going to be path of order to my
[06:44:15] partners you know who I
[06:44:18] am and you must know that my partner is
[06:44:20] keeping an eye on this
[06:44:22] room if she wanted to she could let the
[06:44:26] entirety of peero know about it within a
[06:44:29] few mere seconds what drives you to take
[06:44:32] such a risk
[06:44:33] and extend this invitation on behalf of
[06:44:36] diamond even if it could lead to your
[06:44:40] downfall simply
[06:44:43] put you and I are the
[06:44:48] same however unlike you st for the
[06:44:51] astral Express we band together merely
[06:44:55] to obtain what we
[06:44:57] want um I I don't know if I'd call you
[06:45:00] to the same but past and destined ends
[06:45:03] and on this journey we have been invited
[06:45:05] by Diamond to join
[06:45:08] him why is there a literal Diamond be
[06:45:12] long fishal in the
[06:45:14] back vo in our why is Fishel here
[06:45:22] theide bro what is she doing so diamond
[06:45:27] made us a promise to divide the power of
[06:45:29] the emanator of preservation into 10
[06:45:32] pieces and give each of us a Cornerstone
[06:45:35] to fill that void mortal flesh is
[06:45:37] fragile yet my heart is unyielding like
[06:45:39] the monolith for without this resolve
[06:45:42] the way of preservation would Fade Into
[06:45:45] Oblivion so you understand this pledge
[06:45:49] goes beyond a mere oath it's our
[06:45:52] collateral in exchange for
[06:46:00] opportunities wealth surv Revival and a
[06:46:04] future and whatever we gain from it will
[06:46:06] fortify the stone hearts in return okay
[06:46:09] allowing us to achieve the great cause
[06:46:11] of the preservation When The War among
[06:46:14] the eons eventually
[06:46:19] comes I understand do you take your time
[06:46:22] child you don't need to give me an
[06:46:24] immediate answer like I said patience is
[06:46:28] one of my greatest
[06:46:31] strengths if fate turns that page our
[06:46:34] paths will cross again it's a shame
[06:46:37] though me when I foreshadow something
[06:46:39] that's going to happen in Patch
[06:46:43] 5.2 my last attempt in
[06:46:48] penon well Suk oh [ __ ] I dropped the

[06:53:04] Affairs very well the charmony festival
[06:53:07] is about to commence soon take advantage
[06:53:09] of this unique opportunity the blend of
[06:53:12] work and play is essential for Superior
[06:53:15] knowledge
[06:53:17] absorption how do you rate a
[06:53:20] venturine this is a twitch chatter the
[06:53:22] executives of the IPC and the guild say
[06:53:25] that we are strategic Partners yet from
[06:53:29] my perspective I am invariably the
[06:53:31] teacher and he along with you and every
[06:53:33] other individual is the student from
[06:53:36] this perspective aventurine isn't what
[06:53:38] you call an ideal student yet he's also
[06:53:42] not utterly obtuse alas the void within
[06:53:45] him can never be filled by talent and
[06:53:49] knowledge let's hope he doesn't turn
[06:53:51] into a philosophical
[06:53:55] zombie I thought you're going to make me
[06:53:57] get my act together saying such a thing
[06:54:00] merely indicates that you have not truly
[06:54:02] grasp the essence of learning the
[06:54:05] principle of balancing work and
[06:54:07] relaxation is scientifically grounded
[06:54:10] with the relevant proof process detailed
[06:54:12] on page 21 of the
[06:54:32] sure that's what I'm

[06:55:57] cost no way this is the end game already
[06:56:04] I wouldn't be too worried to fulfill

[06:58:28] and talk stoping your tracks when more
[06:58:31] comes into view cases a showdown with
[06:58:33] the ipc's ambassadors the legacy of the
[06:58:36] nameless and a remnant of the order who
[06:58:39] wishes to replace an eon created
[06:58:41] Paradise with a dream you guys even
[06:58:44] ended up shattering the
[06:58:46] dream it's truly been quite a
[06:58:49] vacation it's a good thing that you guys
[06:58:52] managed to overcome all those difficult
[06:58:54] problems
[06:58:56] congratulations after the charmony
[06:58:57] festival's opening will you guys be
[06:59:00] leaving again
[06:59:02] I don't know where our next destination

[06:59:05] depart
[06:59:07] smoothly there will always be somewhere
[06:59:09] we're going back to San Joo I don't know
[06:59:10] if you saw the trailer for the next like
[06:59:12] uh like the the last uh version preview
[06:59:16] they showed Jaden stuff but they also
[06:59:17] showed a few characters from there they
[06:59:20] didn't like say what they were but we
[06:59:21] saw like Silhouettes and stuff so I it's
[06:59:23] only it's easy to assume we're going
[06:59:25] there but maybe you missed the live
[06:59:26] stream it's okay joining the stellon
[06:59:28] hunters Elio told me that this journey
[06:59:31] will tell me me how to live
[06:59:33] on that's all he
[06:59:35] said as for the
[06:59:38] rest it's up to me to find out ELO so
[06:59:43] I'll pay extra attention to any leads
[06:59:45] that will let me live
[06:59:48] on this trip to pentacon is no
[06:59:52] different no wonder you were interested
[06:59:54] in investing in the watchmaker looks
[06:59:55] like you didn't get what you wanted this
[06:59:57] time yes sadly I was looking in the
[07:00:00] wrong place but I did reap some rewards
[07:00:03] do you know Miss Jade from the IPC
[07:00:06] Strategic investment Department she told
[07:00:08] me her price
[07:00:12] but did you take the deal no but what
[07:00:16] she wanted wasn't my answer either of
[07:00:19] course I want to live
[07:00:21] on
[07:00:24] but what fate owes
[07:00:27] me I want it paid back not passed on
[07:00:33] no one else should be involved this is a
[07:00:35] grudge between me and fate speaking of
[07:00:40] which
[07:00:41] actually I feel that I still owe you a
[07:00:44] formal apology
[07:00:46] for that matter with the performer of
[07:00:49] the iris family even the smallest of
[07:00:52] Lies can turn into a betray as sharp as
[07:00:55] a
[07:00:56] blade I'm
[07:00:59] sorry no problem you shouldn't have lied
[07:01:02] to me in the beginning yes and for that
[07:01:06] to me hiding is much easier than being
[07:01:10] honest yet I still want to try
[07:01:13] expressing my emotions as any ordinary
[07:01:16] person
[07:01:18] would it's that girl get moving these

[07:04:20] cause what makes this Festival so
[07:04:23] uniquely
[07:04:25] significant as is widely known the
[07:04:28] radiant belt Spar had to Halt its voyage
[07:04:31] to an anomaly in the sweet dream
[07:04:34] sparking widespread discussion in the 12
[07:04:37] hours thanks to the hard work of
[07:04:39] penton's internal and external factions
[07:04:43] we've finally gotten the Dreamscape back
[07:04:45] on track just in time for the Charmin

[07:05:15] to commemorate this legendary
[07:05:17] luminary the father of pentacon M Char
[07:05:21] legwork one of the legendary nameless
[07:05:24] who laid the foundations of
[07:05:29] penacon in the most wildering times of
[07:05:32] the planet of festivities it was he who
[07:05:36] from the sky with his companions who
[07:05:39] taught us through trailblazing were
[07:05:41] Freedom lies it was also they who led
[07:05:44] the Vanguard in the pioneering of the
[07:05:47] Dreamscape in exchange for what is now
[07:05:49] known as The Paradise of
[07:05:52] Harmony it can be said that penacon
[07:05:55] spended success today has deeply rooted
[07:05:58] in the trailblazing ethos the watchmaker
[07:06:01] planted with within
[07:06:02] us only by honoring this trailblazing
[07:06:05] Spirit can we fulfill our mission and
[07:06:09] spread Harmony to a broader
[07:06:11] audience dumb a that's she she's talking
[07:06:16] about

[07:18:25] song water Heath the cloud song
[07:18:40] you missed it wait but does it matter
[07:18:42] I'm supposed to talk to
[07:18:44] Firefly 28 minutes 46 seconds 28 minutes
[07:18:48] 45 seconds you're
[07:18:51] here Sparkle eat my
[07:18:54] bat Don't Come Close this bomb is very
[07:18:58] dangerous and I'm the real Firefly since
[07:19:02] you're here I'll just keep it short just
[07:19:04] over half an hour ago I received a
[07:19:06] message from an unknown sender and
[07:19:07] rushed here as soon as I could 27
[07:19:10] minutes 52 seconds the sweet dream has
[07:19:12] lost the protection of the order if it
[07:19:14] were to blow up here the consequences
[07:19:17] would be unfathomable I've scrutinized
[07:19:20] it for a long time but the bomb's design
[07:19:22] is incredibly unique as if it's been
[07:19:24] locked by some mysterious path force
[07:19:27] apart from its creator I fear no one
[07:19:29] knows how to activate
[07:19:32] it Mommy I don't want to
[07:19:37] die
[07:19:40] H
[07:19:42] actually there might be another way do
[07:19:45] you still remember the script said that
[07:19:47] I will experience death three times in
[07:19:49] the land of dreams oh she's going to
[07:19:51] sack herself I think this moment Heralds
[07:19:54] the third time oh
[07:19:56] well what's your plan
[07:20:02] you may already know that I have no way
[07:20:04] of evoking dreams I employ a stellon
[07:20:07] hunter special method in order to enter
[07:20:10] dreams instead this allows me to perform
[07:20:13] Feats that typical just put the bomb in
[07:20:15] Jade's
[07:20:16] room as long as I can bear the pain of
[07:20:19] the Memoria pressure I'll be able to
[07:20:21] dive into the Primal memory Zone beyond
[07:20:24] the dream and extend a Lifeline to the
[07:20:26] radiant feldspar I will take this bomb
[07:20:29] into the depths of the dream Dreamscape
[07:20:32] as deep as possible where there are no
[07:20:34] living Souls around that way at least no
[07:20:37] one will get
[07:20:40] hurt what about
[07:20:45] you don't
[07:20:47] worry I believe that this Firefly armor
[07:20:49] will be enough to take me to where I
[07:20:51] need to go before the countdown
[07:20:53] ends and maybe even make it back
[07:20:57] safely at present this is our best and
[07:21:00] most logical course of action after all
[07:21:04] a long story deserves a happy
[07:21:08] ending I have some words to share with
[07:21:10] you though they were spoken to me by
[07:21:13] Miss
[07:21:14] acaron she said that wait the so-called
[07:21:18] impossible is merely something that is
[07:21:20] yet to happen at the moment there are so
[07:21:23] many things that seem impossible but are
[07:21:26] they really never going to do we know
[07:21:27] how big the bomb is can you just like
[07:21:29] suggest that the moment to disprove
[07:21:31] these impossibilities it off the
[07:21:34] [ __ ] whether it be a literal ending
[07:21:37] suffering akin to
[07:21:40] death or a harrowing death
[07:21:43] Escape before the appointed destination
[07:21:46] arrives like you're literally on a ship
[07:21:50] yet I can still make Mary hat
[07:21:52] choices I also firmly believe
[07:21:57] that that when that moment arrives for
[07:21:59] us to make a choice
[07:22:01] what if it's just confetti cuz Sparkles
[07:22:03] silly and goofy already be within our
[07:22:05] hearts it is not destiny that shapes us
[07:22:10] but we who shape
[07:22:14] Destiny the astral Express cut scene
[07:22:17] what the [ __ ] are like light hello we
[07:22:19] were we walk on different paths
[07:22:23] intertwined moving forward and
[07:22:26] growing it's just a sparkle doll man
[07:22:29] just throw it off the ship but it is not
[07:22:32] today since things are going too well
[07:22:35] let's speed up the
[07:22:37] countdown human life is
[07:22:40] short just like fireflies to a flame
[07:22:43] wait is that how you spell fireflies you
[07:22:45] have an answer in your
[07:22:47] heart always remember don't leave with
[07:22:50] any
[07:22:51] regrets we have this
[07:22:54] right what the [ __ ] is happening
[07:23:00] need
[07:23:01] [Music]
[07:23:05] the it was
[07:23:09] fireworks
[07:23:12] I I told you Sparkle would never about
[07:23:15] other people's safety why don't you go
[07:23:18] take a closer
[07:23:23] look
[07:23:25] okay what the [ __ ] is
[07:23:28] happening everything is possible in this
[07:23:30] land of
[07:23:32] dreams you just got B their own goals
[07:23:36] and realize them in unimaginable
[07:23:39] ways regardless if the result was a
[07:23:42] sweet
[07:23:43] illusion or a bitter
[07:23:47] reality it was an answer he longed for
[07:23:50] day I like how everyone's like happy
[07:23:52] with their friends and then Robin just
[07:23:53] doesn't have a brother why did people
[07:23:55] choose to Slumber well she I don't know
[07:23:58] where he is I think it's as you said
[07:24:01] because in the
[07:24:03] end we will wake up from our dreams
[07:24:10] [Music]
[07:24:32] when I arrived I happened to see a child
[07:24:35] holding
[07:24:36] it he said the flowers were prepared by
[07:24:39] Aunt Jesse for the watch maker and the
[07:24:42] war comrade he'd missed his whole life
[07:24:45] Mel would placed two bunches of flowers
[07:24:48] here year after
[07:24:50] year and after he
[07:24:53] left it became three your wishes will
[07:24:56] always be remembered by someone
[07:25:01] now paniconi as you hoped has welcomed
[07:25:04] the dawn after a long dark
[07:25:07] night the path forward may not be a Bed
[07:25:09] of
[07:25:10] Roses but at least people are prepared
[07:25:13] to step forth towards
[07:25:16] Freedom
[07:25:18] Tian you can go home
[07:25:21] now well the nameless are also preparing
[07:25:24] for the next stop of their
[07:25:27] Voyage oh sure it's us
[07:25:30] [Music]
[07:25:33] but before leaving we still have one
[07:25:36] last thing to
[07:25:45] do say goodbye to
[07:25:48] you it is my
[07:25:51] honor I've said many
[07:25:53] goodbyes yet I am glad that this is the
[07:25:56] first time I speak these words with a
[07:25:58] smile
[07:26:00] before leaving I'm sure you all have
[07:26:03] plenty to say to the nameless of the
[07:26:05] past A fitting end to the tale of The
[07:26:08] Departed one could not ask for a better
[07:26:12] farewell go on they're all
[07:26:21] here one second sorry
[07:26:26] uh
[07:26:28] Monument bid farewell to the the
[07:26:31] nameless honestly when I heard the
[07:26:34] conductor's request I was pretty
[07:26:36] surprised the
[07:26:38] nameless those who Trail blazes doing
[07:26:41] good deeds but never seeking
[07:26:43] recognition after all this time how
[07:26:46] would we even find those three people in
[07:26:48] such a vast place like pentacon but it
[07:26:51] seems in the land of the dreams anything
[07:26:55] anything is possible history may not
[07:26:57] remember the names of the dead but the
[07:27:00] Stars will attest to their Journeys the
[07:27:03] first glimmer of light in the prolonged
[07:27:05] night often illuminates little as it is
[07:27:08] fleeting in the darkness too vast but
[07:27:11] because of this people will
[07:27:14] remember as long as something shines in
[07:27:17] the night sky then when the first star
[07:27:20] falls countless more will follow
[07:27:24] streaking across the
[07:27:26] Horizon a toast
[07:27:30] Brooklyn
[07:27:31] Tian Rosalina J and
[07:27:34] Estella we raise a toast to you
[07:27:37] Trailblazers of the silver rail a toast
[07:27:39] to history that no longer remains
[07:27:42] silent the passionate and courageous
[07:27:45] Pursuit and a
[07:27:47] voyage that traverses the
[07:27:51] stars all right kind of don't care about
[07:27:54] the previous nameless but all good bid
[07:27:56] for El to Gallagher uh oh
[07:28:01] that statue it wasn't here last time
[07:28:05] looks like this is the last Riddle That
[07:28:07] Mr gallager left for us in the end we
[07:28:10] still failed to figure out his true
[07:28:12] identity or if he was even a living
[07:28:15] person what should I
[07:28:17] say I mean this guy is definitely a
[07:28:21] history fictionalist that's not a real
[07:28:23] job fictiony is not real the time at the
[07:28:26] theme that's like
[07:28:27] astrologist years old could that have
[07:28:31] meant something
[07:28:33] too either way he's an enigmatic
[07:28:38] character for
[07:28:40] sure at least our journey together in
[07:28:42] penacon was real enough and his loyalty
[07:28:46] and love Mona is real okay sorry must
[07:28:48] have been real too oh Stars give these
[07:28:52] Trailblazers a
[07:28:56] blessing Gallagher we raise a toast to
[07:28:59] you the the slumbering
[07:29:01] Hound to the festival's invitation to
[07:29:05] all lies and the singular
[07:29:08] truth If We Ever Meet Again please don't
[07:29:12] talk in
[07:29:18] riddles cheers to Gallagher what heat

[07:30:08] see like the aftermath need to live here
[07:30:11] those accustomed to being awake will
[07:30:13] mostly have a hard time getting used to
[07:30:15] a life of Darkness with their eyes
[07:30:17] closed though the order has faded there
[07:30:20] must be someone to watch over this
[07:30:22] Primal memory
[07:30:24] Zone penton's nights are long and there
[07:30:28] are many who are still f I guess we'll

[07:31:53] before you standing before you is a

[07:32:00] were offered to the shatter dream his
[07:32:02] Spirit would remain intact unwavering
[07:32:04] wait what a Chad what the
[07:32:07] [ __ ] D dreams well this is how they're
[07:32:10] meant to be plain and
[07:32:18] [Music]
[07:32:20] simple okay
[07:32:30] can I talk to acon yet or is that
[07:32:44] later this guy R Boo in the end we still
[07:32:49] came full circle this trailblazing
[07:32:51] Expedition started from the moment you
[07:32:53] and a bell boy ran into each other after
[07:32:56] going on a journey of many twists and
[07:32:58] turns they still ended up where they
[07:33:01] started just like a clock's hands that
[07:33:04] turn round and round the start and end
[07:33:07] of each day will always land on 12:00
[07:33:10] what if what if we entered okay what if
[07:33:12] okay hear me out we land in penan first
[07:33:15] time Misha greets us right then we meet
[07:33:18] [ __ ] like Sunday Robin we shoot
[07:33:21] Sunday because he gives weird Vibes we
[07:33:22] already knew that shoot Misha cuz [ __ ]
[07:33:25] you and then boom it we're like like
[07:33:27] effectively the same ending but like
[07:33:28] Gallagher is still alive
[07:33:32] there shouldn't be much left to say this
[07:33:35] entire Adventure started because of you
[07:33:37] and should naturally end with
[07:33:41] you and then a new page will be
[07:33:44] turned a
[07:33:47] toast are you stupid yes but that was
[07:33:50] apparent we raise a toast to you
[07:33:53] watchmaker of the land of the dreams
[07:33:55] nameless of the astral Express to
[07:33:58] penton's past present and future future
[07:34:02] and the child's unwavering dream unto
[07:34:08] death with that our duty as namelist
[07:34:10] should be complete right the trailblaze
[07:34:14] can illuminate the
[07:34:15] way but
[07:34:18] ultimately the future of a world belongs
[07:34:21] to those who live in
[07:34:23] [Music]
[07:34:25] it I still feel that Mr male must have
[07:34:28] really wanted to witness this day
[07:34:33] himself what's on your mind
[07:34:37] March just a strange
[07:34:40] feeling I had it a few stops ago but
[07:34:43] it's super strong this time why not talk
[07:34:46] about it maybe everyone's thinking the
[07:34:48] same
[07:34:51] thing I can't help but think that
[07:34:54] whether it's Mr male Mr tyin or Madame
[07:34:58] Rosalina
[07:35:00] their lives must have been long and they
[07:35:03] must have experienced plenty of
[07:35:06] stories they were also young ones
[07:35:10] stumbling and bumbling around just like
[07:35:13] us getting into scraps and Mischief that
[07:35:16] sort of stuff companions enemies
[07:35:21] Journeys
[07:35:23] adventures all the sad and happy
[07:35:26] memories the every day that we're used
[07:35:29] to what's that game lagging you've lived
[07:35:30] through them
[07:35:33] too but those things are all in the
[07:35:39] past one day our stories will also be a
[07:35:42] part of the past you'll be like oh
[07:35:45] remember
[07:35:47] when 30 years ago I used to play Star
[07:35:51] rail I
[07:35:54] remember it'll be easier to understand
[07:35:57] if I use an analogy
[07:35:59] like when you're reading a book if one
[07:36:03] of its characters keeps running into
[07:36:05] obstacles and experiences an ending man
[07:36:09] I remember when Jade came out we're
[07:36:10] bound to feel a bit mixed about it
[07:36:21] right to me it's because we've seen
[07:36:25] every nook and cranny of their lives
[07:36:27] okay low key though people is special
[07:36:29] look I hope every update keeps getting
[07:36:32] better and better and better but like
[07:36:34] what if in like five years they're like
[07:36:35] man I miss peny that was Peak like I I
[07:36:38] wish I could go back and now we're like
[07:36:40] in
[07:36:43] peny so even if there are parts of it
[07:36:46] that aren't really realistic nor logical
[07:36:50] we still hope that their story gets a
[07:36:52] good ending when it
[07:36:56] comes but what if they and we aren't
[07:37:02] really that
[07:37:04] special when Mr male sat in this chair
[07:37:07] waiting for the astral Express to arrive
[07:37:09] every day what was he thinking and if at
[07:37:13] the end of his life he could still
[07:37:15] firmly say he had no
[07:37:18] regrets then what is this regret we feel
[07:37:22] in our hearts right
[07:37:26] now I think each and every one of us is
[07:37:29] C searching for the answer to this very
[07:37:31] question the universe is vast and our
[07:37:34] lives are but specs the trailblaze Never
[07:37:38] Ends but against the backdrop of the
[07:37:40] cosmos the average person's lifelong
[07:37:43] journey is merely a short stretch but it
[07:37:47] is in this minuscule distance that paths
[07:37:50] cross and countless worlds
[07:37:53] connect the universe may not remember
[07:37:56] every person who leaves a tie along the
[07:37:58] silver whale but we will as long as we
[07:38:01] remember their stories will never
[07:38:04] end whatever you say gorgeous what Mr
[07:38:07] male has left for us is his answer to
[07:38:09] this very question it may not be perfect
[07:38:13] but it left a smile on this storyed
[07:38:16] jaded old nameless his face at the end
[07:38:17] of his life and its meaning will be
[07:38:20] interpreted by those who come after
[07:38:24] us it's not the answer that's important
[07:38:29] but what we can learn from others
[07:38:32] answers right this is what trailblazing
[07:38:37] is
[07:38:40] sure I'm really sorry for bringing down
[07:38:42] the vibe quick Don Hong tell us a dad
[07:38:45] joke to lighten the
[07:38:53] mood it's never a bad thing to reflect
[07:38:56] one day we'll all have to face our own
[07:38:59] farewells well probably you before us
[07:39:01] weld you're [ __ ] like 86 years
[07:39:04] old but before that we still have a long
[07:39:08] way ahead of us
[07:39:11] sorry so the most important thing right
[07:39:13] now is to tell the conductor what we saw
[07:39:16] bro literally comes from honkey impact
[07:39:19] first he lived through first second and
[07:39:21] third honky prepare ourselves for our
[07:39:24] next trailblazing
[07:39:27] destination I should get back to the EXP
[07:39:30] or maybe I could say my final goodbye to
[07:39:35] acaron wait where the [ __ ] is
[07:39:37] acaron also man I'm tired of [ __ ] I'm
[07:39:41] live for 7 hours 40 and I have to stream
[07:39:43] again
[07:39:45] tomorrow oh there she
[07:39:58] is you're just getting old dude I flew
[07:40:00] back home today do you still remember
[07:40:03] when we first arrived in
[07:40:05] pentacon who would have thought our
[07:40:07] paths would cross in such a way well I
[07:40:09] mean I could have guessed it cuz you're
[07:40:10] like R in and there's like R in every
[07:40:12] game significant plus when you talk to
[07:40:13] us it was in red bold plus there's like
[07:40:15] a epic cut scene when we met you but
[07:40:17] it's okay I mean who would have thought
[07:40:19] uh who exactly are you come to think of
[07:40:22] it I didn't even get a chance to
[07:40:24] formally introduce myself simply put I'm
[07:40:28] a self Annihilator who who was cursed by
[07:40:30] the
[07:40:31] nihility my hometown was destroyed a
[07:40:33] long time ago and the whole world was
[07:40:36] erased beneath their
[07:40:39] shadow in order to fight against the
[07:40:41] cruel end of
[07:40:43] self-destruction I went on a journey in
[07:40:46] search of a way to sever the chains of
[07:40:48] the
[07:40:49] nihility after a long and grueling
[07:40:52] search I am convinced that my
[07:40:54] destination lies within the depths of
[07:40:56] the dark web no don't don't go on there
[07:40:59] and an nihility Aaron no in there lurks
[07:41:03] a secret called device
[07:41:05] 9 one day I'll reach
[07:41:11] it we We Ever Meet Again the ocean of
[07:41:13] stars is vast and given our destinations
[07:41:17] I'm afraid our paths may not cross again
[07:41:20] you want to join the astral Express but
[07:41:21] the trailblazing Expedition ahead is
[07:41:23] always full of unknowns and my blade is
[07:41:26] sharp enough to sever fate
[07:41:30] as long as we maintain our original
[07:41:32] resolve I believe there will come a day
[07:41:34] where we will meet
[07:41:36] again have we met
[07:41:39] before in that case I must apologize for
[07:41:42] my
[07:41:44] rudess do you remember when we first
[07:41:47] met I once said you reminded me of an
[07:41:50] acquaintance because of the self
[07:41:52] Annihilator curse my memories are
[07:41:55] Stripped Away blurring my past
[07:41:59] and after our journey together what I
[07:42:02] originally thought were familiar
[07:42:04] feelings were merely Illusions
[07:42:07] what I believe this was truly our first
[07:42:13] meeting what the [ __ ] is that
[07:42:20] Arrow feel like it can't what if it was
[07:42:23] an illusion what do you mean it's
[07:42:25] improbable that you've crossed paths
[07:42:27] with my past self
[07:42:30] what I mean is there is nothing left to
[07:42:33] retrace
[07:42:34] there only n yeah but it would be bad
[07:42:37] writing if if we just like us are like
[07:42:40] we met before but like we didn't
[07:42:43] actually meet
[07:42:45] before think I might have seen someone
[07:42:47] like you I see you've also had a similar
[07:42:52] experience then you should know that
[07:42:54] this me and your memory of me are not
[07:42:58] the same person
[07:43:05] the
[07:43:07] [ __ ] chat what do you think is like the
[07:43:10] Click I feel like if you get to this
[07:43:12] dialogue option what are the odds that
[07:43:15] you click two here I feel like it's like
[07:43:16] a 1% of people click two at this point I
[07:43:19] feel like 99 plus click the
[07:43:22] red but some things will never change
[07:43:29] we made her laugh long ago I too that's
[07:43:33] a win that's a [ __ ] winable
[07:43:36] companions we also embarked on Journeys
[07:43:40] making the best choices we could
[07:43:42] whenever we
[07:43:45] could unfortunately we didn't achieve
[07:43:48] the outcome we
[07:43:49] wanted but moments like
[07:43:53] this make me feel like they never even
[07:43:57] left in this universe there exist
[07:44:00] countless worlds that are similar yet
[07:44:02] different and countless people who are
[07:44:05] alike yet
[07:44:07] distinct I too have wandered alone
[07:44:10] encountering acquaintances on strange
[07:44:13] worlds seeing their silouettes overlap
[07:44:16] with my past in your opinion what does
[07:44:20] this deja vu
[07:44:26] mean a longing for a certain someone
[07:44:33] attachment
[07:44:34] desire
[07:44:37] longing they may all be right but they
[07:44:40] are all
[07:44:41] incomplete I believe it's not something
[07:44:44] external but something that originates
[07:44:46] within us an emotion that traverses time
[07:44:50] from a certain moment of our past to
[07:44:53] reach us perhaps it's a source of warmth
[07:44:56] and
[07:44:57] happiness or maybe it brings pain and
[07:45:00] sorrow wait I saw something glitch each
[07:45:02] time we reminisce on our past we always
[07:45:05] seem to notice a tiny but Unforgettable
[07:45:08] instant that we left behind us along
[07:45:11] with certain other things that remain
[07:45:13] constant
[07:45:15] throughout that is a summary of Our
[07:45:18] Lives encapsulating everything about us
[07:45:21] in these
[07:45:22] moments proof of our shared path within
[07:45:27] them we Glimpse our own Ence
[07:45:30] and
[07:45:31] thus we truly
[07:45:34] exist just like everyone in the story
[07:45:37] hurdling onwards along the path of
[07:45:40] Destiny with passion and courage for the
[07:45:42] things that breathe meaning into their
[07:45:45] lives set forth on your Voyage without
[07:45:48] hesitation nameless on the path of the
[07:45:52] trailblaze this looks like an
[07:45:55] emote even if the ending has been
[07:45:57] predetermined that's
[07:45:59] fine there are countless things that
[07:46:02] humans cannot
[07:46:04] change but before that on the road
[07:46:08] towards the end there are still many
[07:46:11] things that we can
[07:46:14] do and because of this the end will thus
[07:46:18] reveal a completely different meaning
[07:46:22] this is the meaning of
[07:46:25] Journey all those things beautiful
[07:46:28] before
[07:46:29] are still so
[07:46:32] now and I
[07:46:35] believe it will still Bloom at the end
[07:46:38] of the
[07:46:40] nihility until we meet again that's the
[07:46:42] [ __ ] Hawkeye one the Hawkeye third
[07:46:49] one oh this Loki cooler I low key like
[07:46:53] this outfit better or character I don't
[07:46:56] know I like the horns I sh
[07:47:01] [Music]
[07:47:07] this yo yeah why don't they make that a
[07:47:10] skin I mean they probably wouldn't
[07:47:18] but wait that's it I'm gone I don't want
[07:47:21] to talk to pom pom man I don't want to
[07:47:23] go from [ __ ] acaron to pom pom
[07:47:29] there there chin up pom pom wow your
[07:47:33] method of consolation is
[07:47:36] truly
[07:47:38] unsophisticated still better than just
[07:47:40] standing there like a
[07:47:43] scarecrow oh hey you're finally back we
[07:47:47] told pom pom all about our adventure and
[07:47:51] they suddenly started
[07:47:53] crying the k h hop is just just angry
[07:47:59] where the express stops that's right
[07:48:02] it's okay everyone could you all take a
[07:48:06] break in the next car don't worry I'll
[07:48:08] stay here with pom pom but let's
[07:48:15] go he said March shut the [ __ ]
[07:48:18] [Music]
[07:48:25] up I never expected pom pom would be so
[07:48:29] distraught those three nameless must
[07:48:31] have meant a lot to pom pom I guess she
[07:48:34] was like know exactly when pom pom
[07:48:36] boarded the express but I forgot pom
[07:48:38] pom's important sorry sorry their
[07:48:40] Journey has been filled I gave her the
[07:48:42] pon treatment or them my bad my bad more
[07:48:46] than we sorry sorry sorry the fact that
[07:48:48] they're crying so hard is probably a
[07:48:50] good sign it proves that sorry emotions
[07:48:54] haven't become dled by The Grind of time
[07:48:58] they still deeply cherish every nameless
[07:49:01] who has boarded the express and value
[07:49:03] every Journey shared with
[07:49:06] them leave it to himo when it comes to
[07:49:09] comforting there's no one better on the
[07:49:12] express poom said we might run out of
[07:49:14] fuel well they were a little emotional
[07:49:17] at the time but I'm afraid that's not
[07:49:20] out of the question since you joined us
[07:49:23] the express has stayed longer than
[07:49:25] anticipated at every stop along the way
[07:49:28] we just get more fuel sure that everyone
[07:49:30] always makes it back on board pom pom
[07:49:33] has had no choice but to delay the warp
[07:49:35] jump
[07:49:39] schedule I
[07:49:41] see no wonder I can regularly hear pom
[07:49:45] pom pacing anxiously up and down the
[07:49:47] corridor turns out pom pom's been
[07:49:50] silently putting in a lot of work for us
[07:49:53] different from typical Vehicles the
[07:49:56] astral Express converts every Trail
[07:49:58] block BL into the energy it needs to run
[07:50:01] ideally as long as trailblazing exp your
[07:50:04] fault okay I'm hoarding fuel the express
[07:50:07] will receive a can't they just buy the
[07:50:09] batt pass of energy much like a
[07:50:12] perpetual motion
[07:50:15] machine but because of our previous
[07:50:18] encounters fuel is being used up much
[07:50:21] faster than expected we can probably
[07:50:24] only pull off not everyone is a whale
[07:50:26] okay but pom bom has been around for
[07:50:28] like hundreds of years they could afford
[07:50:30] a [ __ ] battle pass if you're like 300
[07:50:33] years old and you don't you're not like
[07:50:35] balling then you failed like okay if
[07:50:38] you're like 20 30 50 and like you know
[07:50:42] you're you still have to work that makes
[07:50:43] sense but if you're like 600 years old
[07:50:45] and you can't buy a battle pass like
[07:50:47] what are you
[07:50:48] doing you've had five like 600 years to
[07:50:51] figure it out only two more isn't that
[07:50:54] super
[07:50:55] risky I don't want to become an ice cube
[07:50:58] floating around found in space
[07:51:00] again Falling Leaves must return to the
[07:51:03] roots how about we shove you back in the
[07:51:06] Space Station's computer then which also
[07:51:10] means that we must prudently consider
[07:51:12] our next
[07:51:13] destination yesing leaves already
[07:51:16] checked the astral charts the two
[07:51:18] nearest worlds to us are the oceanic
[07:51:21] planet of can we go to the ocean one
[07:51:22] please World melanin I want a cook homie
[07:51:25] in this
[07:51:26] game as for which one we're headed to
[07:51:29] that still requires a vote or perhaps
[07:51:33] you might consider a
[07:51:35] suggestion what the hello how did you
[07:51:38] get here everyone we meet
[07:51:43] again it's
[07:51:45] you why were you just in my
[07:51:51] room it's a very cute room Miss Mark
[07:51:55] what just like you
[07:52:04] memoe keeper let's put aside how you
[07:52:07] managed to sneak past everyone and board
[07:52:09] the express for now you mentioned a
[07:52:14] suggestion I accidentally overheard how
[07:52:17] the express obtains
[07:52:20] fuel I just wanted to chat with everyone
[07:52:23] to see if we could work together but now
[07:52:27] it appears my suggest sugestion could be
[07:52:29] the very Lifeline that saves everyone
[07:52:33] please speak
[07:52:34] candidly depending on what you say we
[07:52:37] could very well ask you to
[07:52:40] disembark howy worded like that the
[07:52:43] permanence is
[07:52:44] descendant what a Charming little dragon
[07:52:48] especially with those mired memories of
[07:52:53] yours but I
[07:52:55] digress if the astral Express is in
[07:52:58] urgent need of a special trailblazing
[07:53:01] expedition to recharge its
[07:53:03] engine have you all considered this
[07:53:08] perhaps your destination could be a
[07:53:10] world that even the renowned AI villy
[07:53:13] never
[07:53:14] reached should you be able to lay down a
[07:53:17] new stretch of silver rail the express
[07:53:21] may never have to worry about energy
[07:53:24] ever
[07:53:25] again trailblazing to a world that even
[07:53:28] Naki villy has never been to is that
[07:53:31] possible continue mokee keeper this
[07:53:35] destination of which you speak what sort
[07:53:38] of world is it to to
[07:53:41] that a world that many Across the
[07:53:44] Universe we're going to ging
[07:53:48] exists a World hidden away from outside
[07:53:52] observation its presence only revealed
[07:53:55] by the light from the mirror of the
[07:53:57] garden of Rec collection a world
[07:54:00] fettered by three paths its Destiny
[07:54:03] hanging in the
[07:54:06] balance the Eternal land
[07:54:15] amorus I hope I'm not too late child oh
[07:54:19] well I guess that's where we're going

[07:55:03] done why bother with the compassionate
[07:55:06] pretense and give someone who's about to

[08:05:19] D let's
[08:05:26] go damn I actually finish this Quest on
[08:05:28] time uh with that said I've been
[08:05:31] streaming for eight [ __ ] hours I've
[08:05:33] been tired for the last four sorry if
[08:05:35] it's been a bit out of it uh regarding
[08:05:37] the quest we just did the last like hour
[08:05:38] was really fun the first hour meeting
[08:05:40] with the economy director made me want
[08:05:42] to [ __ ] jump off the astral Express
[08:05:45] in game uh I didn't like that part but
[08:05:48] the rest was cool um mixed feelings but
[08:05:51] I like I like the conclusion I still
[08:05:53] feel like there's some like plot lines
[08:05:54] that aren't finished at all so I assume
[08:05:56] we're going back to
[08:05:59] uh
[08:06:03] overall
[08:06:11] overall I had a lot of fun I like
[08:06:13] penacon a lot
[08:06:16] um also yeah I mean I thought we were
[08:06:18] just going to play Jade today we did but
[08:06:20] we also did other stuff but J Jade's
[08:06:21] cool Jade's like kind of whatever like
[08:06:23] okay okay honest opinion skip Jade but
[08:06:25] if you need pure fiction or are a blade
[08:06:28] man and want a blade support Jay's
[08:06:30] pretty good for that Jade's good with
[08:06:31] blade and Jade's good for Pure fiction
[08:06:33] so yeah but outside of that she's kind
[08:06:36] of whatever um but like you know if you
[08:06:39] like her go ahead um yeah probably just
[08:06:43] a second Channel video for Jade might do
[08:06:45] a main Channel video for next character
[08:06:46] not sure yet
[08:06:54] um boom
[08:06:59] uh what else I was going to say yeah now
[08:07:02] that penin is done well I think I mean
[08:07:04] temporarily done I had a lot of fun with
[08:07:07] it I think it's
[08:07:11] honestly I think I'm biased towards
[08:07:14] liking it more like I I think zag liked
[08:07:16] like the [ __ ] first planet more but I
[08:07:19] I'm biased I like penacon quite a bit
[08:07:21] more not not because it's necessarily
[08:07:23] better lorewise but I just had a better
[08:07:25] experience probably cuz I I'm biased to
[08:07:27] liking the characters a lot but yeah I
[08:07:29] liked
[08:07:31] it quite a bit
[08:07:36] um bog was good I like the especially
[08:07:41] the co like the [ __ ] the buildup into
[08:07:44] the what's it
[08:07:45] called what's that song called whatever
[08:07:48] the pen the coolia fight I forget what
[08:07:50] the song's
[08:07:52] called Wildfire that's what it's called
[08:07:58] um it was really good but yeah I
[08:08:04] wouldn't
[08:08:08] like when I did that I wasn't like wow
[08:08:11] this is I mean I I guess I did enjoy it
[08:08:14] I don't know recency bias too but I I
[08:08:16] like
[08:08:17] peny characters and aesthetic and also
[08:08:21] just the quest line quite a
[08:08:25] lot one my favorit so far
[08:08:33] um but like I
[08:08:35] assume the future areas in quest are
[08:08:38] still going to be good so I don't think
[08:08:40] it's going to like stop being good at
[08:08:42] pentag I just I like these characters a
[08:08:43] lot so it's also more My Vibe than a lot
[08:08:47] of
[08:08:47] the well I mean I like the sanjo
[08:08:49] characters quite a bit Blade's [ __ ]
[08:08:51] sick I don't know we'll
[08:08:54] see um I mean even with like G
[08:08:58] like sumeru was probably like my
[08:09:00] favorite but font 10 was [ __ ] in my
[08:09:03] opinion really really really good so
[08:09:04] it's not like it fell off we'll
[08:09:19] see like yeah I think I'm like the I'm a
[08:09:23] pretty big sumaru Glazer but I think
[08:09:26] Fontan was like on par with
[08:09:29] sumaru uh sumu is probably my favorite
[08:09:32] but I think the font Quest was like very
[08:09:34] similar like like very good low attack
[08:09:37] blade e okay don't talk to me you have
[08:09:40] never played honai star
[08:09:49] rail like f more character- wise H I
[08:09:52] might agree character-wise
[08:09:55] I like uh for
[08:09:58] Marina's probably my favorite
[08:10:02] archon it's either her or venty I don't
[08:10:04] know or wait
[08:10:12] yeah I like freeing a
[08:10:23] lot not an archon Al okay
[08:10:28] man that's
[08:10:38] [ __ ] but
[08:10:44] yeah
[08:10:46] anyways we'll see what happens um start
[08:10:51] was fun
[08:10:55] today uh obviously parts of the stream
[08:10:57] were sponsored but I mean I wanted to
[08:10:59] play it anyway so and I did way more
[08:11:00] like I streamed for [ __ ] 8 hours cuz
[08:11:02] yeah I'm going to do another Star Stream
[08:11:04] later cuz I want to do like some stuff
[08:11:07] um I'll let you know when tomorrow's
[08:11:08] probably genin well definitely genin
[08:11:10] maybe zzz
[08:11:12] after uh we'll see but definitely genin
[08:11:16] so much to do uh I'm back home for good
[08:11:21] starting in like 4 days but I mean
[08:11:23] tomorrow I'm still home so yeah um
[08:11:27] this going to be a pretty big stream
[08:11:28] tomorrow be there I mean we're basically
[08:11:31] I'm just overworking for now so stay
[08:11:34] tuned uh definitely doing genin maybe
[08:11:37] easy after we'll see and regarding genin
[08:11:40] no I didn't drw wa I'm still playing it
[08:11:42] it's just hard to stream four games all
[08:11:44] the time like even when I don't stream
[08:11:45] star Ro like I'm Auto battling my
[08:11:47] dailies it's just it's hard to like yeah
[08:11:49] but anyways um so big gen stream
[08:11:52] tomorrow maybe this after um yeah a lot
[08:11:56] to prep for Emily is coming out I'm hyp
[08:11:58] for
[08:11:59] that um very scared about Natan I'm I'm
[08:12:02] worried they're going to make it
[08:12:03] terrible but I mean we'll see I mean I'm
[08:12:05] hopeful we'll see
[08:12:09] um I'm excited for the Shia guy the [ __ ]
[08:12:11] I don't know what his name is I don't
[08:12:12] think they released it but the
[08:12:14] blackhaired dude we'll see oh no I mean
[08:12:18] that's to like to be fair that's what I
[08:12:20] said about the last two regions and I've
[08:12:22] enjoyed both sumaru and Fontan
[08:12:25] but this one's a bit different we'll
[08:12:29] see like font 10 I thought it was going
[08:12:31] to suck cuz how the [ __ ] would you make
[08:12:33] Underwater Fun and to be fair
[08:12:36] like I'm not the biggest underwater fan
[08:12:39] but I think they made it better than I
[08:12:41] thought they would
[08:12:47] so prage I have
[08:12:54] faith and raw climb xdd
[08:13:00] F characters are really good yeah they
[08:13:10] were I think Su dude I think sumaru if
[08:13:14] only they made the
[08:13:17] archon not
[08:13:20] Nita like dude imagine if it was just
[08:13:22] greater Lord like we I don't know dude
[08:13:24] okay whatever uh
[08:13:27] okay uh I should probably end it's
[08:13:29] [ __ ] late I'm tired imagine I mean I
[08:13:32] like Nita like I think she's cool but
[08:13:36] like I think they could have done better
[08:13:38] with like I think Su was Peak and I
[08:13:41] think a lot of the characters are really
[08:13:41] cool I just think imagine if Nita just
[08:13:43] wasn't a random [ __ ] stupid ass
[08:13:47] toddler okay sorry sorry sorry uh oh
[08:13:51] code's playing s let's read code [ __ ] it
[08:13:53] it's been a while haven't been in stream
[08:13:55] in forever so go say
[08:13:58] hi see what he's up
[08:14:01] to lore relevant yeah I know it is I
[08:14:04] know
[08:14:05] but like again like I I like I like
[08:14:12] niita
[08:14:14] but you're making it weird I mean not
[08:14:17] really Lord of dendro could be a [ __ ]
[08:14:19] shape-shifting Druid like it could be so
[08:14:22] much cooler of a concept than like w I
[08:14:25] have plants I'm a baby
[08:14:28] archon like I like her like I played the
[08:14:30] quest like okay I like Nita but I just
[08:14:32] feel like visually like lur aside
[08:14:35] visually they could have made her cooler
[08:14:37] I think that's all but like again she's
[08:14:40] the one I I like the story a lot but
[08:14:51] yeah anyways um
[08:14:57] we're ending I'm just waiting for the
[08:14:59] raid to start be nice to code I'll be
[08:15:00] live again
[08:15:01] tomorrow with h gansin and then I'm
[08:15:04] going for like two days and then I'm
[08:15:06] back and then yeah we'll see what we do
[08:15:09] [Music]
