[00:58:27] online wait Dar
[00:58:35] man yo this guy means business what the
[00:58:38] hell already yo how yo what the
[00:58:43] [ __ ] God
[00:58:47] damn yo already C6
[00:58:52] downn let's
[00:58:54] go anyway
[00:58:57] ways Co-op Farm oh I guess I could do
[00:58:59] someone's uh B like world like if they
[00:59:01] have the boss I guess I could do that
[00:59:02] actually please explain her C1 okay
[00:59:05] listen I'm going to have zag double
[00:59:06] check the math on this but I'm pretty
[00:59:08] sure it's just plus 25% damage you're
[00:59:11] welcome like literally 25% damage
[00:59:13] increase that's it like that's all you
[00:59:14] need to
[00:59:16] know which is just good like that's
[00:59:18] insane for a C1 25% is [ __ ] insane
[00:59:20] Shia's damage increase is like2 okay
[00:59:23] maybe not but like one
[00:59:30] also it gives you resistance
[00:59:32] Interruption but I honestly think that's
[00:59:33] copium that's not what I say in the
[00:59:35] guide but in my heart like cuz you're
[00:59:38] running a shield anyways it's really
[00:59:39] nice if you're not it's really nice if
[00:59:41] you're running SRO but I feel like dude
[00:59:43] what's is happening this guy just
[00:59:46] die I just feel like you need a shield
[00:59:48] because think about it with Hut C1
[00:59:51] you're like okay you less need a shield
[00:59:52] because you don't need you can stamina
[00:59:54] right offensively sure
[00:59:56] but with arino you're going to [ __ ]
[00:59:58] die like you can't get
[01:00:04] healed even with C1 you you you can't
[01:00:07] get healed so like resistance
[01:00:08] Interruption is nice but if you're
[01:00:10] getting interrupted anyways you're
[01:00:12] [ __ ] dead except if you run SRO so
[01:00:14] you
[01:00:18] know check the new profile pictures oh
[01:00:20] wait yeah true actually I'll check after
[01:00:23] this I'm sorry I need to like I I would
[01:00:26] skip this if I didn't have the choice
[01:00:27] but I have I don't have the
[01:00:29] choice do I get lon's weapon or arino
[01:00:31] I'm a Lin main uh
[01:00:40] honestly if you don't have a good Linny
[01:00:42] weapon you could pull on the banner and
[01:00:44] then you might get AR Lino's weapon and
[01:00:45] then that makes the choice for you but I
[01:00:47] I wouldn't recommend like if you if you
[01:00:49] only care about Linny do you want
[01:00:50] another pyro DPS probably not so yeah
[01:00:54] depends
[01:00:59] why gen always do this
[01:01:01] yeah that's fine I just I don't like
[01:01:04] when

[01:01:58] going to have to do it like I need the
[01:01:59] [ __ ] weekly
[01:02:02] mat this is the one she uses by the
[01:02:07] way sad or Scarlet sense I don't even
[01:02:09] know what sad is but Scarlet sense is is
[01:02:12] broken so that one I don't even need to
[01:02:13] know what [ __ ] sad is why would you
[01:02:15] abbreviate a weapon as
[01:02:19] sad what the [ __ ] is
[01:02:24] sad sadge
[01:02:29] 800 resin yeah uh I saved it cuz there's
[01:02:31] a new artifact set right here so we're
[01:02:34] going to do this
[01:02:36] today C1 or R1 C1 I can I can make a
[01:02:40] I'll make a clip about it and then we'll
[01:02:41] just make it a command wait is this just
[01:02:43] a free chest oh bet something with oh I
[01:02:46] have to defeat
[01:02:47] him I will have
[01:02:50] order hold her e
[01:02:53] begging you can't hold her e what are
[01:02:55] you talking
[01:02:58] about you can't you mean hold her
[01:03:05] e hold charge stop back seating I
[01:03:09] recorded a 45 minute video on arino you
[01:03:12] literally cannot backseat this character
[01:03:14] for me I I guarantee you I have like 90%
[01:03:18] of the game knowledge if you're like a a
[01:03:20] theory crafter and you like discover
[01:03:21] like an 18-second rotation I don't know
[01:03:24] about then please feel free to share it
[01:03:25] with me that I appreciate but if it's
[01:03:27] basic [ __ ] like normal attack I
[01:03:34] know but uh yeah you you you so you
[01:03:36] don't you wait 5 Seconds usually after
[01:03:38] Skilling but it's not waiting you're
[01:03:40] just swapping to your support so it
[01:03:41] doesn't actually matter uh but in AOE
[01:03:43] I'm pretty sure you don't have to I'm
[01:03:45] pretty sure in AOE it's 65% per Mark and
[01:03:47] you cast at 145 so if you have three
[01:03:49] that's 60 * 3 which is over 145 well 65
[01:03:52] * 3 which is over 145 so you don't have
[01:03:53] to wait you just eat and then well you
[01:03:55] still can wait there's no downside to
[01:03:56] waiting but there's also no upside so
[01:03:58] you just e and then you do your support
[01:03:59] stuff what the [ __ ] is
[01:04:02] this they wanted to see the flying
[01:04:04] animation wait no they
[01:04:07] didn't cuz they said hold for charge but

[01:14:54] what the [ __ ] oh
[01:14:56] yeah how do I dodge that oh I just run
[01:14:59] away
[01:15:00] okay I'll figure out his mechanics later
[01:15:02] let me give arleo
[01:15:06] friendship I mean the other characters
[01:15:08] here don't need it but whatever what the
[01:15:10] [ __ ] oh yeah I forgot to
[01:15:14] charge uh okay what the [ __ ] okay uh we
[01:15:17] only got two boss Ms though unlucky but
[01:15:19] this is [ __ ] cracked
[01:15:20] hello yeah dude her charge attack like
[01:15:22] you dash so [ __ ] far it's a terrible
[01:15:24] charge attack but you dash really
[01:15:28] far um you can also Glide for
[01:15:30] exploration which is
[01:15:32] cool doesn't do anything but it's
[01:15:36] cool are you going to see one
[01:15:40] no maybe after the guide sniffer maybe
[01:15:45] ah I don't really want to I think it's
[01:15:48] um it's really good but like I don't
[01:15:50] like ah resistance Interruption is fun
[01:15:53] maybe I don't know I don't know maybe
[01:15:55] maybe
[01:15:59] maybe is there C1 good okay I don't want
[01:16:02] to bait anyone to pull so like you don't
[01:16:03] need it however I think it's
[01:16:05] unironically the best C1 in the game or
[01:16:07] like top three at least for a DPS it's
[01:16:09] like it's pretty
[01:16:11] stupid but it's not needed it's not like
[01:16:14] I think the resistance Interruption is
[01:16:15] sometimes
[01:16:17] fake it's just more
[01:16:20] damage but also a lot of the teams I
[01:16:22] play like I don't want to run a shield I
[01:16:24] think shielding is is cringe so for me
[01:16:26] it's going to help more because I'm
[01:16:28] probably going to run like SRO or like
[01:16:29] kazua and in those teams Interruption
[01:16:32] resistance does help a
[01:16:33] lot versus like I think most people are
[01:16:36] just going to jangi or whatever shielder
[01:16:38] you
[01:16:51] have not trying to B as the best C1 in
[01:16:53] the game quotations yeah how's that bad
[01:16:55] how is me being honest about it being
[01:16:56] broken bad it's like you don't need it
[01:16:59] but like I'm not going to lie and say
[01:17:00] it's bad it's better than her weapon and
[01:17:01] her weapon's really
[01:17:03] good it's I think it's um I think she's
[01:17:07] going to be similar to Hut where in like
[01:17:10] right now 90% of Hut players I know have
[01:17:13] either H or C1 or both even the freeto
[01:17:16] playay ones like a lot of them are like
[01:17:17] okay well I love Hut so I'm getting them
[01:17:19] I feel like arlino
[01:17:20] similar the thing is though uh Hut C1 is
[01:17:24] now
[01:17:26] uh it kind of got [ __ ] by Shen Yun
[01:17:28] it's still good but like with shenyun
[01:17:30] you kind of don't need it anymore but
[01:17:32] that's only if you have
[01:17:34] shun
[01:17:37] anyways her weapon's also a scythe and I
[01:17:40] think like even if I think C1 is more
[01:17:43] damage me I would go for the Scythe cuz
[01:17:45] it's cool does that mean I would
[01:17:47] recommend it no but you know wait I
[01:17:49] don't even have a [ __ ] hello I
[01:17:51] thought I made
[01:17:52] enough oh yeah I made some but I left
[01:17:54] like some spare cuz I thought the boss
[01:17:55] might drop fire
[01:18:02] stuff
[01:18:11] we
[01:18:17] gaming anger
[01:18:21] no I didn't mean to hello
[01:18:29] I made a bunch of um like look at look I
[01:18:31] have I made six of these but I guess I
[01:18:33] don't have enough of the small
[01:18:43] ones is C2 R1 the way the way for
[01:18:48] what no man save your money this game's
[01:18:51] easy but uh okay honestly I think really
[01:18:54] good early stopping point is C1 R1 if
[01:18:56] you want to like whale a little uh C2 is
[01:18:58] good C3 is good but I think she's dude
[01:19:02] she's a good whale character I can't lie
[01:19:04] like all of her constellations except
[01:19:06] useless ass dog [ __ ] ass C4 they're all
[01:19:09] really good like this is amazing this is
[01:19:10] amazing okay amazing really good really
[01:19:12] good uh dog [ __ ] dog [ __ ] and then good
[01:19:15] like really uh pretty [ __ ] good it
[01:19:18] the C6 itself doesn't seem better than
[01:19:20] like some other c6s but when you combine
[01:19:21] it with the other cons it's pretty
[01:19:23] [ __ ] good because the other cons are
[01:19:24] really good
[01:19:26] so
[01:19:29] yeah use child with her
[01:19:32] no um she's not

[01:36:14] different like it's not the same uh
[01:36:16] arino C1 is like a huge damage increase
[01:36:18] but it's not like necessary like it
[01:36:20] doesn't let you dash cancel instead of
[01:36:22] jump cancel like C does the thing with
[01:36:24] Hut though is like it's incredibly
[01:36:26] valuable but if you have like sh if
[01:36:28] you're playing shun it like makes it to
[01:36:30] where C1 C 0 same thing so it's like a
[01:36:33] bit weird right

[01:50:22] the same like
[01:50:33] VA please don't break my pillar thank
[01:50:35] you uh I should probably e first and
[01:50:38] then are uh yeah are about to
[01:50:41] get everybody stand
[01:50:47] back my shield broke
[01:50:59] I need to [ __ ] break this ge
[01:51:08] [ __ ] whatever it's
[01:51:16] broken it's the first step in five
[01:51:19] stages whoa 76k
[01:51:22] W
[01:51:23] pogger
[01:51:26] poggers
[01:51:30] okay 70
[01:51:32] whoa I can chill at 80 maybe maybe I
[01:51:35] don't have to go all the way to 90 I can
[01:51:36] chill at 80 but uh we need to get like
[01:51:39] 10 more bosses no not 10 more five more
[01:51:42] at most if we get unlucky four or five
[01:51:44] uh yeah J is geared I think all my
[01:51:47] characters are
[01:51:49] geared yeah
[01:52:03] on a scale from Five Star version of
[01:52:04] Shang link to four fourstar version of
[01:52:07] Shang link to Five Star version of Yia
[01:52:09] how good is our Lino the thing is a
[01:52:10] fourstar version of shy Ling would be
[01:52:12] better than a festar version of Yia
[01:52:26] no pyro Go's better Coffee
[01:52:37] Rush is it worth leveling to 90 at all
[01:52:39] no I meant like ascending Bart you don't
[01:52:41] need to 90 her you could keep her at 80
[01:52:43] but um unless you're burgeoning but uh
[01:52:48] well I guess overload kind of overload
[01:52:51] damage doesn't really matter but it does
[01:52:53] scill on your
[01:52:55] level but you're it's probably it might
[01:52:57] be your Electro character what's your
[01:52:58] team yeah it'll probably be your Electro
[01:53:00] character over
[01:53:01] loading anyways I'm talking about
[01:53:04] ascending her like I might keep her at
[01:53:05] 80 cuz I don't know if I can do [ __ ]
[01:53:06] 20 plus
[01:53:09] 12 let me get this Waypoint
[01:53:23] thank you for the plus five Geeks Source
[01:53:26] W I hope your stream went
[01:53:29] well y or ficial why would you ask me
[01:53:32] that honestly both I think Yi um Yi
[01:53:36] fishal AR Lino Chevrolet is actually a
[01:53:38] pretty good team the only problem is if
[01:53:40] you're playing with no well you can't
[01:53:42] heal right so if you're playing with no
[01:53:44] Betto you kind of want to like die so uh
[01:53:47] I like bet on that team over like y but
[01:53:50] y i i played y official and cleared with
[01:53:51] it was it was fun that was good
[01:53:54] um Bennett's probably better like you
[01:53:57] could do like Bennett Chevy and then
[01:54:00] either a shield or just offishal I'm not
[01:54:02] killing those
[01:54:06] seals doesn't chev's heal yeah man yeah
[01:54:09] she heals yeah yeah try it try to try to
[01:54:13] heal your arino man see see see what
[01:54:15] happens so for those of you who don't
[01:54:17] know I guess I didn't open this menu yet
[01:54:19] you know how kakomi can't crit yeah I
[01:54:22] like can't heal so uh like you just
[01:54:25] don't heal except with your burst but
[01:54:27] you don't want to burst unless you have
[01:54:29] to so you're you're literally like yeah
[01:54:33] you're either shielding or you're Singo
[01:54:36] rain sorting or bet whatever or you're
[01:54:38] just dodging everything cuz you're a
[01:54:39] gamer that's what's

[01:56:10] just like no damage like you're doing
[01:56:11] like four damage and then you have to
[01:56:13] like wait 5 seconds and it's like you're
[01:56:15] not buffed you're not going to swirl
[01:56:16] just for your [ __ ] Q like it's just

[02:20:28] of
[02:20:30] these you wish to know more about me on
[02:20:33] occasion we hold an impressive The Taste
[02:20:37] is the intent this me always keep anger
[02:20:40] some call me excessively strict no it is
[02:20:45] let me know about the doctor
[02:20:48] myself time to retire for the night
[02:20:52] overruled transfixed laid bear this is
[02:20:56] witness M Everlasting as the moon what
[02:20:59] greater pleasure is an
[02:21:03] impressive okay step back new strategy I
[02:21:06] hear the he this
[02:21:09] shall okay no need to an insurmountable
[02:21:12] this will be a productive partnership I
[02:21:16] over okay
[02:21:23] I might go Scarlet actually dude my
[02:21:25] ratio on Scarlet is [ __ ] stupid look
[02:21:27] at this I checked 102 213 [ __ ] okay
[02:21:31] sorry it's actually pretty good but um
[02:21:33] we're going to do we're going to do
[02:21:37] Jade Pepe W dude I mean my glad is
[02:21:40] [ __ ] insane I was the rank one child
[02:21:41] worldwide Nationwide when he used two
[02:21:43] glads so I had like 20 glad million
[02:21:45] pieces okay not this one that one's just
[02:21:47] good for crit rate cuz any crit rate
[02:21:49] this one's insane this is offset insane
[02:21:50] this is really good on set insane this
[02:21:51] is pretty good ER is useless though but
[02:21:53] it is what it
[02:22:04] is why is the Scythe benched I mean
[02:22:06] level 70 is not better doesn't matter
[02:22:08] I'll level it when I uh when I
[02:22:18] can H almost that was good
[02:22:21] in theory if you're calculating it yes
[02:22:24] Jade is better but slightly however in
[02:22:27] practice let me show you
[02:22:31] something it is okay let me show you
[02:22:35] something it is very difficult to get
[02:22:38] enough crit rate when you're playing
[02:22:41] home like hom on a crit damage scaling
[02:22:43] character like Hut or her I'm going to
[02:22:45] go in 17.9 crit rate flow 16 crit rate
[02:22:49] feather 10.5 on the Sands 10 on the
[02:22:53] [ __ ] goblet and a circlet and I'm
[02:22:55] probably like 82 okay I'm at 90 never
[02:22:57] mind this is actually enough this is
[02:22:58] actually insane I might keep this build
[02:23:00] good idea chatter never mind but like
[02:23:02] usually it's it's hard to get a good
[02:23:04] ratio because you're ascending on crit
[02:23:05] damage and you you um you're running a
[02:23:08] crit damage weapon so like you kind of
[02:23:09] want crit rate weapon but I mean if you
[02:23:11] if you can get this then
[02:23:13] yeah I also get more crit damage when I
[02:23:15] Ascend again if I do this 21 em Pepe W
[02:23:20] me doesn't
[02:23:23] matter Em's a little more cope than you
[02:23:25] think it's good but I mean I have some
[02:23:27] my cirit that's why this build is better
[02:23:30] actually it's just it's not worth like
[02:23:32] stacking em that's only good in one of
[02:23:34] the like four teams I'm going to play
[02:23:35] and even then it's not NE like it's good
[02:23:37] but it's not necessary because you're
[02:23:38] vaping one every like three hits whereas
[02:23:41] with like Hut you're vaping every hit
[02:23:42] well every charge attack so it's not
[02:23:44] like it's good but it's not like I need
[02:23:46] it or my character is bad um but I was
[02:23:49] running this piece it's like my pieces
[02:23:50] were different I had about yeah 79 I
[02:23:53] think wait why is my crate so low this
[02:23:55] is not what I was running the [ __ ] was I
[02:23:58] running I don't know maybe it was
[02:24:12] this I can't
[02:24:15] remember whatever
[02:24:43] okay
[02:24:45] uh well I still need to figure out how
[02:24:47] to explain this hey Mr Z Tri X him kind
[02:24:51] of sad lately can you Omega my Al for me
[02:24:54] other way first
[02:25:28] foring to another 5
[02:25:45] seconds I can show you guys what I'm
[02:25:47] writing
[02:25:54] I mean whatever like leaked but like
[02:25:56] it's fine I'm trying to figure out how
[02:25:59] the [ __ ] to like add this I don't want
[02:26:00] to talk about it but I don't want to
[02:26:01] like I want to add text either very
[02:26:04] minimal damage or
[02:26:08] two uh
[02:26:46] okay
[02:26:48] okay I just think I want to put a note
[02:26:51] as to why you shouldn't burst at the
[02:26:53] start cuz that was the question I had I
[02:26:54] was like if you have your burst you
[02:26:55] might as well just [ __ ] burst right
[02:26:57] but like it's not true CU it's [ __ ]
[02:26:58] dog [ __ ] but I don't want to like record
[02:27:00] 30 SEC like add a minute to the video of
[02:27:02] me explaining it so I might just put
[02:27:03] text cuz like I don't want to explain
[02:27:05] why a good rotation is good but then
[02:27:07] also explain why a bad rotation is bad
[02:27:08] like I'm not going to teach someone a
[02:27:09] bad rotation so that they don't use it I
[02:27:12] don't know maybe I should but I feel
[02:27:13] like it's a waste a time I'll just put
[02:27:15] text like you don't all you need to know
[02:27:17] is don't cue at the start if you care
[02:27:18] about why just read the text probably
[02:27:20] maybe I don't know anyways we're gonna
[02:27:22] play her boom boom boom beep beep
[02:27:27] beep chori benett Jong Lee uh no but
[02:27:31] maybe later probably okay that team is
[02:27:33] never being played but it's not bad you
[02:27:34] can play it h I'm just not going to
[02:27:36] pretend I'm going to play it and then
[02:27:37] cuz I know I'm not going to play it but
[02:27:38] you can if you want to I'm never playing
[02:27:40] that though but you
[02:27:43] can uh we're going to play bad here
[02:27:51] why no Kazo here cuz you're going to
[02:27:53] [ __ ] die it's good though socks
[02:28:22] okay I don't know if I'm being one guide
[02:28:24] or if it's like if it's the same person
[02:28:26] or if
[02:28:28] um if I'm being one guide or if people
[02:28:32] think or if I'm missing
[02:28:35] something why is everyone pretending
[02:28:37] like C2 is about her burst like yeah you
[02:28:40] can eqe if you want but your Q is still
[02:28:41] going to do one
[02:28:43] damage that doesn't even make it better
[02:28:45] like the this is not about your burst at
[02:28:47] all it doesn't change your burst at all
[02:28:48] it just makes it to where you don't have
[02:28:49] to wait and you get um when you charge
[02:28:53] attack or whatever the [ __ ] well yeah
[02:28:54] charge attack you're going to deal a
[02:28:55] huge hit of damage that you can Vape or
[02:28:57] whatever so this is not about your burst
[02:29:00] it's just big it's good like it's a big
[02:29:02] damage it's a well it's a pretty decent
[02:29:04] damage
[02:29:05] increase Co but it's not like it doesn't
[02:29:08] change your
[02:29:15] burst do instructor J

[02:53:45] healed too late for Reg
[02:53:49] like it's it's not it's literally just
[02:53:50] like [ __ ] you you're not getting healed
[02:53:51] that's all it says it's actually weird
[02:53:53] that they included like a swear word in
[02:53:55] the game I didn't think they would do
[02:53:56] that but yeah I mean it's
[02:54:05] cool oh my God I got a cut

[02:55:31] yet okay let me level her weapon let me
[02:55:32] level her weapon does it look good on
[02:55:50] dude apparently they changed it to where
[02:55:52] ores used to it used to be C at 9999 and
[02:55:55] now they added another nine so instead
[02:55:56] of 9,000 it's 900 it's 999,000 but like
[02:55:59] dude if why if you're hoarding [ __ ]

[02:57:20] of want to just equip it but it's

[03:15:44] last I've never had it expire on me
[03:15:46] before wait how long does e
[03:15:50] last uh last 30 seconds I [ __ ] waited
[03:15:54] 30 seconds I literally Yapp for 30
[03:15:57] seconds it is what it is I mean you know
[03:15:59] whatever I'm a
[03:16:07] yapper we let you cook but you didn't
[03:16:09] let the E
[03:16:10] cook well I'm glad I don't let you cook
[03:16:30] explain how to play her in razor terms e
[03:16:32] swap supports swap back to her charge
[03:16:34] attack normal attack that's it Q if
[03:16:37] you're going to
[03:16:38] die but if you can you
[03:16:44] eqe there's okay okay there's there's
[03:16:47] okay okay fine I'll do this once this is
[03:16:50] how you play arino there's three
[03:16:52] rotations everything else sucks dick
[03:16:54] there's three rotations okay
[03:16:59] Aro one is optimal you do e then you go
[03:17:04] to your
[03:17:05] supports
[03:17:07] supports for 5 seconds then you swap
[03:17:11] back to her and you do uh charge attack
[03:17:15] and then spam Norm
[03:17:19] option two this is the second best is
[03:17:23] the same [ __ ]
[03:17:24] thing but you're like at the end of your
[03:17:27] rotation you're like oh [ __ ] I'm low so
[03:17:29] then you do e again and then q and then
[03:17:34] e again and then you restart and then it
[03:17:36] repeats
[03:17:40] repeat option
[03:17:43] three option three is basically the the
[03:17:46] same
[03:17:47] idea it's basically the same
[03:17:51] thing but somewhere along the way you're
[03:17:57] like oh [ __ ] I'm low HP and then mid
[03:18:01] rotation you you're like okay [ __ ] it
[03:18:03] I'm out and then you q and then you e
[03:18:05] and then you restart you're like okay
[03:18:07] then you go again this is like oh [ __ ]
[03:18:09] if you're low HP you just Q this is like
[03:18:11] how I think you're supposed to play her
[03:18:12] where like ideally you're just not
[03:18:14] queuing but then if you're ever low
[03:18:15] you're like oh [ __ ] I'm low and then you
[03:18:17] just q and then e and then you keep
[03:18:18] going and then this one is if you want
[03:18:20] you can just at the end of your rotation
[03:18:22] the like Optimal time to queue is if
[03:18:23] your E's back up cuz you can e and then
[03:18:25] Q for five particles and then e again
[03:18:27] and I just made two
[03:18:31] [ __ ] but yeah oh Gage oh Gage oh
[03:18:44] Gage is this part of the guide I mean

[03:24:33] you said please a oh never mind I
[03:24:35] thought you were
[03:24:37] pulling what I thought I heard
[03:24:40] Claymore yeah yeah
[03:24:42] like you needed Claymore to break the
[03:24:45] shield F don't hold EQ I see and if you
[03:24:50] break the shield they're not going to
[03:24:52] die if you start the doain with only Q
[03:24:55] then hold e then hit them with the
[03:24:56] Claymore once is she angling a
[03:25:05] power I'm going to try
[03:25:11] it okay first of all where the [ __ ] is
[03:25:14] Jake second of all um
[03:25:19] H what was I going to say I don't know
[03:25:24] but I'm following so far I
[03:25:28] agree oh yeah okay what do you think the
[03:25:30] best way is to explain stream oh really
[03:25:35] the [ __ ] yeah hello why did he say do
[03:25:38] you guys want to farm together and then
[03:25:39] end his
[03:25:40] stream huh
[03:25:47] the
[03:25:49] [ __ ] wait did I make him wait I just did
[03:25:52] one abys clear oh I guess I kind of
[03:25:55] reset that
[03:25:57] is cuz she attacks so fast let's do that
[03:26:02] did he say I hate Nick I'm actually
[03:26:04] really hungry I need to eat oh he's
[03:26:06] hungry or me too actually all
[03:26:12] good anyways I was going to say okay
[03:26:14] what do you think what do you think is
[03:26:15] the best way to explain how dog [ __ ] it
[03:26:17] is to queue at the start do I just say
[03:26:18] it's the same scaling as two normal
[03:26:20] attacks cuz it
[03:26:24] is what do you mean what do you mean the
[03:26:27] start what what what start like like
[03:26:28] starting your rotation with eqe like
[03:26:31] like fresh like you enter Abyss you just
[03:26:36] eqe I mean you do that when you want to
[03:26:38] heal no no like starting like 121 you
[03:26:41] just entered you EQ cuz your energy is
[03:26:43] full what um I mean I like using de's
[03:26:48] birth okay I guess I guess it is but
[03:26:51] like I'm not going to say
[03:26:52] that okay think am I okay I guess it's
[03:26:56] kind of like starting your rotation with
[03:26:59] duuke burst instead of [ __ ] buffing
[03:27:01] him
[03:27:02] first like it's an idiot wait
[03:27:05] speedrunners do
[03:27:07] that no they don't no but I saw a
[03:27:09] speedrun it was like duuke Q instantly
[03:27:11] and then he killed it in like one plunge
[03:27:14] he like queed and then swab did [ __ ] and
[03:27:15] then like plunged and then it died or
[03:27:17] two plunges okay anyways yeah I get what
[03:27:20] you're saying
[03:27:23] though wait I need to level her weapon
[03:27:25] do you want to kill the new enemies do
[03:27:27] you do you have the new

[04:15:27] shield because this character literally
[04:15:29] dies to the air breathing the wrong
[04:15:32] [Applause]
[04:15:41] way gotcha take it
[04:15:48] easy cuz I played her with kazua instead
[04:15:51] of J Lee and I was vaping like over 200k
[04:15:54] for the first three like her her damage
[04:15:56] is really front loaded it goes a lot
[04:15:57] worse as the rotation is longer but I
[04:16:00] was I did like over 200 but then I I
[04:16:02] went J Le and it was like 150ish and
[04:16:04] it's like the Jang Le tee is like way
[04:16:07] easier to play like with kazwa i i the
[04:16:10] the [ __ ] Last Enemy actually killed
[04:16:11] me a few times but I ALS also two shot
[04:16:13] the chicken like the chicken died like
[04:16:15] halfway through my rotation and I was
[04:16:16] like what the
[04:16:18] [ __ ] and it's weird cuz it's like if you
[04:16:20] show someone that team they're going be
[04:16:21] like okay this character is broken and
[04:16:22] then if you show them the WR lead team
[04:16:24] they'll okay it's like it's all right
[04:16:26] like it's pretty good but so it kind of
[04:16:38] depends Yip and Yap true
[04:16:43] oh wait I can Ascend cool
[04:16:46] it boom honestly there's no reason to 90
[04:16:49] her but like I I don't know I [ __ ]
[04:16:50] love arino I don't think this's yeah I
[04:16:53] mean yeah [ __ ] it I mean yeah I mean
[04:16:56] yeah [ __ ]
[04:16:59] it bench in two days I don't think I'm
[04:17:02] going to bench
[04:17:03] her you love all characters no I
[04:17:10] don't okay fine idea back to being poor
[04:17:14] yeah it's fine I want a 90 everyone
[04:17:16] eventually I mean my shun
[04:17:19] 77 chori bench dude okay but like I was
[04:17:22] never like yeah chori she's cool she's
[04:17:25] okay she's just albo too no disrespect
[04:17:27] but I'm not like [ __ ] Head Over Heals
[04:17:29] about chori but arino we like AR we love
[04:17:33] arino chori's cool not
[04:17:38] arino looking
[04:17:48] like okay if I were to name my top eight
[04:17:52] characters arino makes it if I
[04:17:57] name
[04:17:59] yeah it's it's literally Shia in no
[04:18:02] order Shia Alam finina kakomi
[04:18:07] arlino maybe nevet I'm not sure
[04:18:13] wait who
[04:18:17] else uh
[04:18:24] Soo design wise Soo play style wise
[04:18:27] kazua like I think Kaza is like
[04:18:29] incredibly
[04:18:30] fun soo's not that fun but he's cool
[04:18:35] so
[04:18:36] de did they ruin DEA for me like I like
[04:18:39] her but like they actually ruined it
[04:18:41] like they they ruined it she went from
[04:18:42] cool to being like kind of Omega
[04:18:52] LOL maybe nevet I like nevet I like
[04:18:55] rizzly too
[04:18:57] but I don't really play
[04:18:59] him I don't know
[04:19:03] maybe am I a s if I say Yan
[04:19:09] maybe oh duuke the Luke's cool
[04:19:14] honestly I [ __ ] love shenyun but
[04:19:15] that's just child bias
[04:19:17] anyways
[04:19:22] um should I do the same on
[04:19:25] team agre uh and then second half okay
[04:19:28] dude let's do the same team with actual
[04:19:30] damage this time cuz last time we had
[04:19:31] [ __ ] no build fortnite no
[04:19:35] build whoa did you say fortnite I
[04:19:38] love I love
[04:19:40] fortnite where's Fel this so many
[04:19:42] characters in this [ __ ] game now dude
[04:19:44] no wonder every guide I make is six
[04:19:46] years long it's like I have to talk
[04:19:48] about like look at how many characters
[04:19:49] there
[04:19:51] are I'm
[04:20:03] sorry like the ging guide you didn't
[04:20:05] make Adorn my knight into the
[04:20:09] wind stable up silence the
[04:20:17] Beck that's [ __ ] what's Talent upgrade
[04:20:21] priority normal attack then normal
[04:20:22] attack then normal attack then close
[04:20:23] your game but if you really want to go
[04:20:25] further then q and E are kind of
[04:20:26] whatever I think Q is slightly better
[04:20:28] but like I could be wrong it doesn't
[04:20:29] really matter you level your normal and
[04:20:31] then the other two if you want like go
[04:20:33] 10 1066 ideally
[04:20:44] all right let's
[04:20:58] goid oh that's actually quite a bit like
[04:21:01] noticeably
[04:21:08] better wa wait okay yeah let's assume I
[04:21:11] want to heal I do this then I do this oh
[04:21:13] I should have overcharged shot first but
[04:21:14] it's fine I can just resummon it boom
[04:21:17] boom boom and now he's
[04:21:20] dead stupid ass
[04:21:22] chicken gliding gliding
[04:21:27] gliding what is that poster gamer lean
[04:21:31] wait no one even asked what that poster
[04:21:32] is I just saw gamer lean what did
[04:21:33] someone ask what is that team it's not
[04:21:35] even bad it's someone replied mono pyro
[04:21:37] it was there was literally fishal in the
[04:21:39] team it's overload
[04:21:44] one with it's just a Chev theme it gets
[04:21:47] a lot better with Chev C6 I don't have
[04:21:48] it bro what the
[04:21:51] [ __ ]
[04:21:53] okay okay the might be humble oh my
[04:22:03] water
[04:22:04] uh um I mean yeah so the thing with
[04:22:09] finina well it depends on your team I
[04:22:11] liked um finina uh yelling like double
[04:22:14] Hydro with uh
[04:22:16] shenyun okay this is no it's
[04:22:18] fine if if you're going to play finina
[04:22:21] the problem with finina with
[04:22:23] um arino is that it works and finina
[04:22:28] applies enough Hydro because um what's
[04:22:30] her name arino pyro isn't that fast but
[04:22:34] the problem is your HP draining on a
[04:22:37] character that can't heal so you're
[04:22:39] Perma 50 50% HP so there's a good chance
[04:22:41] you die which means ideally you want a
[04:22:43] Healer but you can't really run a Healer
[04:22:45] in that team a lot of the times if
[04:22:46] you're uh sorry not a Healer a shielder
[04:22:48] but usually you can't run a shielder in
[04:22:50] that team because you need a Healer for
[04:22:51] your other characters so your finina
[04:22:53] actually Stacks uh which means you're
[04:22:55] running like shenyun or Bennett and then
[04:22:57] your last slot is usually another hydro
[04:22:59] and there's no Hydro shielder so it's
[04:23:01] kind of hard you could do one hydro
[04:23:02] finina and then like B it J Lee it's
[04:23:05] probably fine but the the downside there
[04:23:07] is still like that's probably not enough
[04:23:09] healing like is your finina going to
[04:23:10] stack if the only character getting
[04:23:12] healed is no one literally just arlino Q
[04:23:15] so you're probably getting no Stacks you
[04:23:16] could do um you guys having Suk maybe
[04:23:19] [ __ ] sigin maybe but like the team I
[04:23:22] like with finina was like finina shenyun
[04:23:24] and then like yolan cuz then you can get
[04:23:26] like plunges you can heal whatever so it
[04:23:27] works but yeah outside of that it's a
[04:23:31] bit weird but yeah like
[04:23:34] yeah
[04:23:36] Sask he knows I literally know nothing
[04:23:39] about her except that she was drip
[04:23:40] marketed as hydro and and has a [ __ ]
[04:23:42] like healer gun on the art so I and it's
[04:23:45] like not it's pretty obvious that she's
[04:23:46] either going to be a Healer or some
[04:23:47] [ __ ] bondage Bond I Bond of Life [ __ ]
[04:23:50] cuz of a [ __ ] pole arm that they
[04:23:52] release forino that's like oh if you
[04:23:53] have Bond of Life you'll gain Dam
[04:24:00] it it's an emote bondage is an emote in
[04:24:05] chat uh I need to overload your team no
[04:24:10] rest for the
[04:24:14] it's not wait it is what the [ __ ] is dor
[04:24:17] wait I swear there's an emote oh it's oh
[04:24:19] dor is just BDSM okay my bad wait
[04:24:21] there's actually an emote it might okay
[04:24:23] it might be in other chats dude but I'm
[04:24:24] like a regular twitch chatter I'm in
[04:24:26] everyone's chat okay not true but like
[04:24:28] kind of kind of true kind of true kind
[04:24:30] of not true is this guy going to die
[04:24:35] hello oh yolan is bondage okay that's
[04:24:38] why I didn't know I didn't have it
[04:24:40] though
[04:24:45] please Dash backwards please Dash
[04:24:48] backwards okay he just shot down fixed
[04:24:51] my
[04:24:53] Royal everybody
[04:24:57] stand o
[04:25:08] 82k okay thank
[04:25:10] you cool
[04:25:24] what does that
[04:25:29] mean is this te worth running is CH is
[04:25:31] c0 mine is C 0 well C1 but I don't think
[04:25:33] C1 actually does anything
[04:25:36] um it's good I'm pretty sure it's
[04:25:39] competitive with Vape with Chevy C6 and
[04:25:42] like slightly better slightly worse and
[04:25:43] without it it's a bit
[04:25:52] worsec
[04:25:57] silence the the thing she has over Hut
[04:26:00] is that she's performs basically the
[04:26:02] same in like a lot of like Vape monop
[04:26:05] pyro overload depending on stuff she's
[04:26:08] not as much just like a vape carry
[04:26:11] whereas Hut is more of just like good in
[04:26:14] Vape the
[04:26:17] vapage let's light it up I might as well
[04:26:20] overload
[04:26:29] this over Final War go in as you
[04:26:35] wish I'm dead dude I'm dead I'm dead
[04:26:37] like what can I do he started [ __ ]
[04:26:40] during my setup
[04:26:49] I couldn't burst there I needed to e
[04:26:51] first well I I guess I could have just
[04:26:52] YOLO bursted but like I don't want to do
[04:26:54] that that's like
[04:26:58] cringe
[04:27:08] silence into the wind shower me with PR
[04:27:12] better than CLE or Linny if she's worse
[04:27:14] than CLE I'm
[04:27:16] uninstalling she does not feel worse
[04:27:18] than
[04:27:35] CLE by Royal Decree why did I do a dude
[04:27:39] get me out official okay I don't know
[04:27:40] why I was doing bow plunges
[04:27:46] Adventure
[04:27:51] Time off we go let's light it
[04:27:56] upop everybody midnight
[04:28:07] V I can't Dodge I had no stamina look at
[04:28:09] my bar look at it look at it everyone
[04:28:11] look at it look at my St guard I
[04:28:12] couldn't Dodge okay I could have queued
[04:28:14] but I wasn't going to queue all good I
[04:28:17] could have just pressed Q I should have
[04:28:18] just pressed Q I should have just
[04:28:19] pressed Q I should have just pressed you
[04:28:20] it's fine I thought I could like I
[04:28:21] thought the crystallized Shield would
[04:28:22] have saved me cuz it was a crystallized
[04:28:24] Shield I was like oh I'm not going to
[04:28:25] die I
[04:28:28] died SLE down be
[04:28:35] Sanctified okay the problem with alting
[04:28:37] is if I ever ult then it's just a waste
[04:28:38] of DPS and then it just it's like a bad
[04:28:40] clear even if I do clear automatically a
[04:28:44] bad
[04:28:45] clear and I'm
[04:28:47] picky e setup Q
[04:28:50] E you look like the type to somehow
[04:28:53] drown in font 10 [ __ ] you here's the
[04:28:56] problem with e setup QE if you e and
[04:28:58] then set up and then Q you have to then
[04:29:00] e and then wait another 5 seconds and
[04:29:02] you're then you have to set up again it
[04:29:03] goes e set up Q E set up again and
[04:29:07] that's that's number one number two is
[04:29:09] if by God's grace you don't need to set
[04:29:10] up again let's say you have C2 then
[04:29:12] guess what just happens all of your buff
[04:29:14] up time was used on your Q which has a
[04:29:16] 8year animation and does as much damage
[04:29:18] as two normal attacks and then all your
[04:29:21] Buffs
[04:29:22] expire oh
[04:29:25] wa
[04:29:29] yeah but like I thought about that too
[04:29:32] like I was thinking like if I have my
[04:29:33] burst at the start why don't I just
[04:29:34] burst but like anytime I try to do it
[04:29:37] it's just
[04:29:37] worse so I get where you're coming from
[04:29:40] but no you shouldn't
[04:29:44] uh what was I doing oh yeah this and
[04:29:46] then this and then
[04:29:51] this why not QE setup I mean you
[04:29:54] can you know what let me do that for you
[04:29:56] let me do that for you look you want to
[04:29:59] see what doing Q at the start of your
[04:30:00] rotation does let me show you well you
[04:30:02] might as well e first cuz it resets the
[04:30:03] cool down
[04:30:04] look one Missippi to Mississippi 45k
[04:30:08] that is literally one normal attack it's
[04:30:11] like just not worth the time like you
[04:30:13] can but it's one normal attack like I do
[04:30:15] that in one [ __ ] normal oh wait I
[04:30:18] don't need to reset drop
[04:30:20] your light it
[04:30:22] up so like if you un if it's not buffed
[04:30:25] it's bad and if it's buffed it's a waste
[04:30:27] of your
[04:30:30] buff so uh tough luck oh I don't have my
[04:30:35] e
[04:30:40] midnight but all looks cool yeah then
[04:30:42] use it at the end of your rotation you
[04:30:43] can eqe if you attack long enough for
[04:30:44] your e to be
[04:30:51] back oh
[04:30:53] oops like there I could I could have
[04:30:54] aled there if I wanted to but like he
[04:30:56] shielded so I didn't but that was not a
[04:30:58] bad time to
[04:31:00] Al oops I should be on this guy
[04:31:15] go
[04:31:23] POG read our Lino good night voice
[04:31:30] line time to retire for the
[04:31:33] night oh can't sleep you
[04:31:36] say well I'm afraid you'll have to
[04:31:39] figure something out for yourself
[04:31:42] I have a certain suspicion my solution
[04:31:44] won't be to your
[04:31:47] liking seeing yourself our ideals are
[04:31:50] not do want to kill us time to retire
[04:31:52] for the
[04:32:06] night it will be to my liking do not
[04:32:09] deny this
[04:32:14] see Zero yeah level 80 weapon cuz I'm
[04:32:17] lazy I I could show the build again fine
[04:32:21] 80 glad this
[04:32:25] 866 friendship to
[04:32:27] wow pretty good stats though I mean it's
[04:32:30] glad so like everyone has good glad but
[04:32:32] yeah I'm glad you
[04:32:45] dud you know I haven't even tried her in
[04:32:46] chamber one at all like [ __ ] these pyro
[04:32:48] garbages I don't want to do
[04:32:55] this okay what should I
[04:33:02] play I could either just do like [ __ ]
[04:33:04] Vape again or I could do mono
[04:33:09] pyro can you try melt no melt is melt
[04:33:13] okay I actually did try it I mean I
[04:33:19] I I mean I I did a melt clear I like I
[04:33:23] did a melt not even clear I did it
[04:33:24] against the [ __ ] Geo VAP do I still
[04:33:26] have my
[04:33:29] Waypoint I don't it's it's it's it works
[04:33:35] like I actually managed to keep up with
[04:33:37] her pyro with melt which is cool like
[04:33:39] that felt nice but the problem is
[04:33:42] the the main reason I [ __ ] hate melt
[04:33:43] a allot of times isn't even because of
[04:33:46] like it's like strongid or whatever it's
[04:33:49] Coo's burst lasts 8 seconds rosaria's
[04:33:51] burst I believe also lasts 8 seconds so
[04:33:53] like everything's just gone after you
[04:33:55] melt like twice and it's just
[04:33:58] annoying but it works like you can keep
[04:34:01] up with the Melt it's not bad I don't
[04:34:03] think it's a bad team it's just
[04:34:06] like
[04:34:08] yeah oh yeah yeah [ __ ] Rosaria has C2
[04:34:11] yeah it's not 8 seconds it's plus 4 12
[04:34:15] maybe whatever but still Kazo right
[04:34:18] shoot every rotation with her start with
[04:34:21] E greater than Q greater than e to
[04:34:23] maximize energy no do you know what's
[04:34:25] more energy than e q e e without the Q
[04:34:28] because then you keep your full rot your
[04:34:30] full energy true because what happens is
[04:34:32] at the end of your rotation you get
[04:34:34] another E so then you e and then q and
[04:34:37] then e again
[04:34:39] or okay here's something I also didn't
[04:34:43] really explain so another
[04:34:47] reason another
[04:34:50] reason another reason why the
[04:34:53] rotation doesn't say Q unless you need
[04:34:56] to heal isn't just because it's a waste
[04:34:58] of DPS but also it's a waste of bond of
[04:35:02] life so when you queue on arlino you
[04:35:04] lose any excess Bond of life you have
[04:35:07] but AR Lino's skill only gives her up to
[04:35:11] 140 but you can have up to 200 and
[04:35:13] usually at the end of your rotation you
[04:35:15] have about 30% left cuz even if you're
[04:35:17] normal attacking non-stop you stop doing
[04:35:20] pyro hits at 30% Bond of life or under
[04:35:22] 30 so you're going to have a bit left
[04:35:24] over that bit left over is gone if you
[04:35:27] cue but if you don't quue you keep it so
[04:35:29] you have a bigger Bond of life in your
[04:35:30] next rotation so it's like better to
[04:35:32] just not press it because not only is it
[04:35:34] worse DPS than normal attacking but also
[04:35:36] it makes your next normals worse
[04:35:49] happy no I mean no mean me you geta
[04:35:55] that's fine anyway thank you for being
[04:35:58] the coolest smartest it's probably not
[04:36:00] enough cryo is iter ever Jung cook and
[04:36:02] Gojo of genin impact she feels like she
[04:36:05] definitely applies more pyro than
[04:36:07] gumming
[04:36:14] feel like she has to well I know she
[04:36:16] does but like I feel like this has to be
[04:36:17] too slow maybe it isn't where's
[04:36:21] diano where the [ __ ] is diano that's
[04:36:24] Dory
[04:36:30] diano on a scale of Shia to nlet how
[04:36:33] strong is she Shia and nlet are
[04:36:34] literally right next to each other Net's
[04:36:36] obviously better but Shia's like top
[04:36:37] three so she's not even on the scale but
[04:36:39] she's close she's she's pretty she's I
[04:36:41] think she's really good she's not neet
[04:36:43] cop him you [ __ ] coping but oh wait
[04:36:45] this is the wrong half I mean it doesn't
[04:36:47] matter actually it does matter I can't
[04:36:49] even test anything on that dude [ __ ]
[04:36:50] this Abyss
[04:37:15] why the [ __ ] did I do
[04:37:22] that by that logic Ryden top three
[04:37:24] because
[04:37:25] Trevor okay
[04:37:30] brother what does that even mean
[04:38:02] oh where the [ __ ] is it oh there is
[04:38:18] Dio The Hunt

[04:38:30] judement let's Light It
[04:38:33] Up Everlasting as the moon
[04:38:40] over okay
[04:38:42] actually I should probably reset my cool
[04:39:09] down think you can bully me
[04:39:14] everybody oh I forgot to eat whatever I
[04:39:16] mean damage doesn't matter I just want
[04:39:17] to see if it wait this isn't even like
[04:39:19] close
[04:39:21] wait wait maybe it
[04:39:28] is I mean kind
[04:39:34] of maybe
[04:39:50] H damn CH really up there with newa the
[04:39:53] team of three five stars and the c64
[04:39:56] star
[04:40:03] verus think I have to wait for that cryo
[04:40:05] to go or I don't get it no but I just
[04:40:07] applied pyro so it's over yeah [ __ ] okay
[04:40:11] maybe
[04:40:17] not light it
[04:40:28] up you can't run
[04:40:32] okay Dona
[04:40:37] wall okay but this is just bait it's
[04:40:40] literally bait
[04:40:47] I don't think this uh I mean maybe it
[04:40:50] keeps up I'm going to do Bennett first
[04:40:51] [ __ ] the up time just apply cryo here
[04:40:55] and then do this make sure I don't
[04:40:57] overtake the cryo oh I'm dead no I'm
[04:41:00] not but he's out of the [ __ ] I mean
[04:41:02] dude it's
[04:41:06] whatever think you can bully me
[04:41:17] is yeah yeah I don't know I like the
[04:41:20] Kazo team better I
[04:41:35] think oops [ __ ] am I doing
[04:41:47] 90 90 90 there is sounds good to
[04:41:52] me I don't have my e
[04:41:59] m got two boss materials every time yeah
[04:42:02] that happens yeah I'm I'm play this
[04:42:06] again I'm also skipping this which one
[04:42:09] feels scraft better The Vape overload or
[04:42:13] melt
[04:42:14] one uh Vape well I mean I know the M
[04:42:18] like I've seen the math on all of them
[04:42:20] vape and overload are similar but only
[04:42:22] if you have C6 Chevy without it vape's
[04:42:24] still F I mean overload still fine
[04:42:25] overload feels better cuz you don't well
[04:42:28] Vape feels better but overload is like
[04:42:30] better in comparison to what you're used
[04:42:31] to because there's a lot of like broken
[04:42:33] Vape characters already whereas there's
[04:42:35] aren't that many that
[04:42:36] like do what can do what she does
[04:42:39] outside of just Vape which is pretty po
[04:42:45] what the [ __ ] am I doing let's do this
[04:42:47] on this on this
[04:42:52] wind I mean this guy's [ __ ] dead I
[04:42:54] this won't
[04:42:58] even like I get the like see I melted
[04:43:01] everything well not every hit but like
[04:43:02] every time I applied pyro it's just Kos
[04:43:04] burst and Rosaria burst they expire in
[04:43:06] like 1 second it's [ __ ] annoying so I
[04:43:08] don't know
[04:43:12] not bad though that's not
[04:43:17] bad over Vape over Vape is okay it's
[04:43:20] just
[04:43:22] like it's okay I think it's a worse vape
[04:43:24] and a worse overload but like it's okay
[04:43:26] it's not bad it's it's it's over Vape is
[04:43:29] just you're playing like your team is
[04:43:31] cro Bennett already or yolon Bennett
[04:43:34] already and then it's just like fishal
[04:43:35] as the fle flex slot it's fine it's not
[04:43:37] bad
[04:43:58] di is better it doesn't matter I'm
[04:44:00] saying I like Kazo there better it
[04:44:03] doesn't matter who the things are as
[04:44:04] long as if the team works it like the up
[04:44:07] time like the the cryo ticks aren't
[04:44:08] [ __ ] faster it doesn't matter
[04:44:11] who I'm playing as long as it's enough
[04:44:13] for [ __ ]
[04:44:15] arino if it works it works I don't need
[04:44:17] to like I'm not doing a bis clear with
[04:44:18] it it's just for one [ __ ] geish
[04:44:21] app I might play this team again though
[04:44:23] but I don't know what I want on the last
[04:44:24] slot I kind of don't want I mean maybe
[04:44:26] we just [ __ ] Bennett maybe mono Pyro
[04:44:53] 200
[04:44:54] em okay I'm going to say this once and
[04:44:57] I'm going to say this only
[04:45:05] once Actually I don't even need to say
[04:45:08] this I just melt is melt is melt melt is
[04:45:10] melt it doesn't matter what the [ __ ]
[04:45:11] you're playing if you have enough cryo
[04:45:13] app and you're melting it you're okay
[04:45:15] but the up time is only going to be 8
[04:45:16] seconds on Kazo regardless diona cool
[04:45:18] Rosaria cool Lila whatever the [ __ ] your
[04:45:20] Kaa cool but your kazwa lasts for six no
[04:45:23] sorry 8 seconds so it's like it's it's
[04:45:25] good damage while it lasts but it's
[04:45:27] going to like you're going to have to
[04:45:28] like you're going to have the rest of
[04:45:29] your rotation where you're not melting
[04:45:31] but it's fine like the characters are
[04:45:33] still good or you swap out early but you
[04:45:36] can't really swap out that early H
[04:45:39] her but yeah I mean it's fine
[04:45:41] it's not as bad on her cuzz her Pyro's
[04:45:43] not that fast and her damage is very
[04:45:45] front loed so it's okay like you can
[04:45:48] melt the important stuff but you're also
[04:45:49] not melting every hit you're melting
[04:45:53] like one and
[04:45:57] three or like one and
[04:45:59] three it's standard ICD on the normals
[04:46:02] so
[04:46:04] yeah
[04:46:07] anyways I mean I'm sure it'll be good
[04:46:09] against the terror room it'll be
[04:46:11] annoying as [ __ ] against this guy and
[04:46:13] then it'll be good against
[04:46:27] this himage okay I'm going to yell on
[04:46:31] actually let's play
[04:46:32] SRO and no Shield I don't think I've
[04:46:35] done that yet I'll do this
[04:46:47] [ __ ] it we're going to suck against
[04:46:49] capellia I accepted my
[04:46:52] fate I don't want to play nevet
[04:47:07] again thought Mon Power be good yeah
[04:47:09] Mon's good

[04:48:00] s d the [ __ ] team layout and like how
[04:48:03] it saves characters and how it removes
[04:48:05] one in the middle and [ __ ] in Star rail
[04:48:06] is just objectively so much better I
[04:48:09] don't know why they don't just import it
[04:48:10] it's the samey
[04:48:11] like you can literally just copy paste
[04:48:12] it I'm sure it takes no death

[05:01:10] delivery don't worry um now this is this
[05:01:14] is dude he didn't answer me oh I'm muted
[05:01:17] you you don't need a defensive said I'm
[05:01:20] recording defensive
[05:01:22] option on my account so I have to borrow
[05:01:24] yours account did my 7 TV doesn't
[05:01:27] work I
[05:01:34] can't what's her damage without the
[05:01:36] weapon I mean it's I mean I did a clear
[05:01:38] without it's I I we're level 80 I don't
[05:01:41] think it's like I mean it's still better
[05:01:47] but it's like a it's a it's a 10 to 20%
[05:01:51] increase depending on your weapon like
[05:01:53] 30 if you have like white
[05:01:55] tassel wait is it 30 wait I have it I
[05:01:58] mean I I'll I'll put it in the
[05:02:01] video it's pretty huge compared to like
[05:02:04] a freeto playay option but it's
[05:02:06] pretty okay no no it's good okay it it's
[05:02:10] huge compared to your fre option it's
[05:02:11] good compared to other five stars but
[05:02:13] like staff of scarlet and vape is pretty
[05:02:15] similar it's maybe like it's 5 to 10%
[05:02:22] worse but I mean there there's going to
[05:02:24] be a weapon rank in the
[05:02:26] video it's also a pretty like Niche
[05:02:30] weapon but it looks cool but C1 is like
[05:02:33] 25% damage it's [ __ ] insane and
[05:02:36] resistance
[05:02:37] Interruption so yeah
[05:02:52] R5 Jade I'm pretty sure R5 Jade might be
[05:02:55] better or it's really
[05:02:58] close cuz this is dude this is a lot of
[05:03:00] [ __ ]
[05:03:04] damage was probably 24
[05:03:35] no I don't think she she has a scythe
[05:03:37] with other weapons cheddar I'm pretty
[05:03:38] sure it just doesn't
[05:03:42] transform I see it
[05:03:48] doesn't
[05:03:55] trans Skyward is
[05:03:59] different yes it does I mean it makes
[05:04:01] like the [ __ ] thing but it doesn't
[05:04:02] change how the weapon looks I don't
[05:04:04] think I mean whatever it maybe my
[05:04:07] [ __ ] maybe I'm not leaned in let me
[05:04:09] let me
[05:04:11] see it has like the like the animation
[05:04:14] like the line yeah it makes like a
[05:04:16] physical
[05:04:17] Scythe oh wait that's kind of cool
[05:04:19] actually okay I didn't notice
[05:04:28] that okay not
[05:04:30] bad wait is it the same with everything
[05:04:49] with the element infused wait a second

[05:10:52] this is [ __ ] bad
[05:10:57] vibes can you be serious what do you
[05:10:59] think about her so far no wait who are
[05:11:03] likeo yeah I mean I think the exact same
[05:11:06] as before I started stream think she's
[05:11:08] really good
[05:11:10] yeah I think unironically I really
[05:11:14] Overlook jungle's burst Synergy with
[05:11:18] okay no but that's just cuz all this
[05:11:19] [ __ ] is like Geo propaganda
[05:11:22] stabiliz no like straight
[05:11:25] up have you have you tried her with J Le
[05:11:28] on the first
[05:11:30] side no do you think I should cuz
[05:11:35] Okay like if you JY burst like after
[05:11:38] doing your whole setup
[05:11:41] this because so much of her damage is
[05:11:43] front loed losing a little bit of Ben
[05:11:46] time isn't that big of a deal wait why
[05:11:47] don't you just J the before Bennett oh
[05:11:50] you want to petrify them I see yeah it
[05:11:52] makes it so the enemies stay group for
[05:11:54] your whole first normal attacks
[05:11:56] right yeah I guess I mean that's also
[05:11:59] assuming you're fighting the [ __ ] dog
[05:12:00] [ __ ] ass cringe
[05:12:02] specters I mean it like it works on the
[05:12:04] foui operatives and it's built so good
[05:12:07] against them I see
[05:12:12] is that just quiet oh really wait why do
[05:12:14] I hear him fine okay I'll turn him
[05:12:19] up
[05:12:20] yo but I got em before a damage like
[05:12:24] damage does that mean em is easy to
[05:12:26] build I thought em was impossible okay
[05:12:28] anyways
[05:12:29] um wait I got an em s too
[05:12:34] hello got the [ __ ] em starter kit
[05:12:37] stun locked okay
[05:12:39] yeah no I think she I like her I wish I
[05:12:41] had C6 Chevy but I mean I was cting
[05:12:44] pretty fast with my [ __ ] I wish I had
[05:12:45] Chev oh you don't even have one no okay
[05:12:49] that's crazy yeah that's [ __ ] crazy
[05:12:53] it is kind of
[05:12:57] unfortunate honestly I think this te are
[05:13:00] kind of fake anyways wait you're
[05:13:03] coping like the the ones dude you
[05:13:05] haven't even played
[05:13:07] them wait oh did you viewer account yeah
[05:13:10] oh wait why are they fake hello like the
[05:13:13] the ones with Benet are good well yeah
[05:13:16] cuz it's [ __ ] Bennett but but they
[05:13:19] don't have good defensive options and
[05:13:21] the ones with defensive options feel
[05:13:23] like they're just not great they're
[05:13:26] significantly worse but you don't want
[05:13:27] to hear my take about defensive options
[05:13:29] also wait B's fine
[05:13:31] but you don't want to hear my take about
[05:13:33] defensive options I think if you play sh
[05:13:35] you're usually just going damage like
[05:13:37] you're going benett and I also think
[05:13:39] if you need a like if you need a shield
[05:13:42] you're going jangly or you're going
[05:13:43] Singo like defensive utility with Vape
[05:13:45] you're not playing [ __ ]
[05:13:47] overload like just that's what I'm
[05:13:50] saying defensive options [ __ ] suck
[05:13:52] for overload yeah but I don't think that
[05:13:53] makes the team bad I think like if
[05:13:55] you're like skill issuing make the team
[05:13:57] fake no cuz if you're skill issuing and
[05:13:59] you don't have a good shielder then
[05:14:00] [ __ ] pull Hut like what are you doing
[05:14:02] you're like pulling a hard character to
[05:14:03] play but you don't you can't play them
[05:14:05] well and you don't have a good shielder
[05:14:06] like what are you doing if if you do
[05:14:08] have a good shelder like that's the
[05:14:10] point the good shielders don't work in
[05:14:12] teams yeah then play either play her
[05:14:14] well or change her
[05:14:16] team sometimes it's not an issue of
[05:14:18] playing her well sometimes the damage is
[05:14:19] kind of just unavoidable yeah and then
[05:14:21] you just
[05:14:23] reset but like yeah I mean fair but also
[05:14:26] not fair can't you just
[05:14:33] like well I'm thinking I mean I guess
[05:14:35] it's just V I
[05:14:38] mean Toma C6 isn't terrible it's not
[05:14:41] good it's like okay there's also the
[05:14:43] fact that like you actually lose damage
[05:14:45] from having to use burst like so much
[05:14:48] damage yeah no I I refuse to press Q
[05:14:50] like I try my best not
[05:14:52] to it's just like I literally have die
[05:14:55] because I know that if I quue my
[05:14:56] rotation cooked it's not just your
[05:14:59] rotation cooked it also your next
[05:15:01] rotation deals like [ __ ] damage
[05:15:06] yeah I think I think Toma is probably
[05:15:08] not that cope like his damage sucks but
[05:15:11] like I mean C6 C6 C6 it's fine it's all
[05:15:15] he does is 15 damage I know I know I
[05:15:26] know yeah I think the team that's
[05:15:29] pleasantly surprised me the most is
[05:15:30] benett kazah only I kind of expected it
[05:15:33] to be ass but in a Content I think it's
[05:15:37] my favorite one wait you like Kaza more
[05:15:40] than uh I didn't press e oops you like
[05:15:42] Kaza more than Shang Ling yeah I kind of
[05:15:44] do that is traiter
[05:15:48] behavior it's probably just cuz this
[05:15:50] abys is like wait why are you playing
[05:15:52] first half
[05:15:54] though I'm not going to play AE like I'm
[05:15:57] not going to test her AOE on second half
[05:15:59] oh
[05:16:01] Fair
[05:16:04] yapping why you didn't say you were
[05:16:05] testing her AOE
[05:16:09] oh so what did you think I was tesing
[05:16:10] when I was talking about in AOE I prefer
[05:16:13] this team team you know what [ __ ] you
[05:16:17] how did you think I conducted my testing
[05:16:19] that's not even what your sentence was
[05:16:20] you're gaslighting me you were like oh I
[05:16:22] don't like shev's team I like this
[05:16:25] team that was a whole L different
[05:16:27] conversation you slid the conversation
[05:16:30] in the other conversation 30 seconds ago
[05:16:32] I said I'm a little I'm moving a little
[05:16:35] slow motion
[05:16:39] whatever it's fine the the pack is only
[05:16:41] as fast as the slowest
[05:16:47] wolf yeah so just
[05:16:51] just I don't
[05:16:53] know kill him
[05:16:55] okay then the pack gets faster
[05:16:59] true okay I'll actually play her first
[05:17:01] half whatever I'll try it I'll I will
[05:17:04] say though the Pyro Mage is yeah yeah
[05:17:07] that doesn't sound fun
[05:17:09] that's fine with with Kaz J Le you can
[05:17:11] kind of just break his shield with Kaz J
[05:17:14] Le
[05:17:14] true
[05:17:18] um he really likes yapping yeah he
[05:17:22] does I who he
[05:17:28] is all right kazwa
[05:17:40] H okay I'm going be honest though I know
[05:17:42] this is
[05:17:45] like oh yeah I guess it just depends
[05:17:48] what [ __ ] dude the thing with arlino
[05:17:50] teams it depends what [ __ ] content
[05:17:51] you're doing like second half I don't
[05:17:54] need a shielder at all like unless I
[05:17:56] [ __ ] up the enhancer Mech at all like I
[05:17:59] I play Kaza I play [ __ ] I played y
[05:18:01] official sh I I had a good clear but
[05:18:03] like I feel like if I fight capellia
[05:18:04] without a shield I'm like actually just
[05:18:06] dead yeah I like that it's like it makes
[05:18:10] her team building actually Dynamic yeah
[05:18:12] it's cool I agree but then I disagree
[05:18:16] with your sh teams are fake it just
[05:18:17] depends what you're doing like second
[05:18:18] half was I was [ __ ] pogging
[05:18:20] yeah wow oh I shouldn't have used that
[05:18:24] that's
[05:18:27] fine I do think though that
[05:18:32] like like she's kind of jangly
[05:18:34] propaganda for like
[05:18:37] the the like
[05:18:39] nonprofessional dodging
[05:18:42] player
[05:18:45] yeah what to get more shielders man yeah

[05:34:14] pretty good character uh her your team
[05:34:16] building process usually you want a
[05:34:18] defensive option like a shielder or
[05:34:19] something but uh if you're good at the
