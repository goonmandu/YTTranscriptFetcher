[00:13:02] think soccer is like a good Chad I like
[00:13:04] that character Arc
[00:13:12] here Yuri is cool black hair girl is
[00:13:15] cool uh the [ __ ] biker dude was cool
[00:13:17] until one thing that I'm not gonna spoil
[00:13:19] and then uh the computer programmer
[00:13:23] person was cool
[00:13:27] the reason I'm
[00:13:32] star math random event the math daily so
[00:13:35] I figured I might as well stream it I
[00:13:37] might as well still the stream the math
[00:13:44] so true
[00:13:46] true
[00:13:50] well let me change webcams
[00:13:53] [Music]
[00:13:59] okay Chad quick quick math math quizzes
[00:14:02] are daily quick quick quick magic like
[00:14:04] dude so Jeff wishes he could listen okay
[00:14:07] among them Among Us
[00:14:10] Howard Philip and Joyce among them is a
[00:14:13] good man a bad man and a liar the good
[00:14:14] man tells the truth the madman only lies
[00:14:16] on the liar he lost says anything
[00:14:19] Joy said Philip is either the good man
[00:14:22] or the bad man Philip said either Howard
[00:14:24] or Joyce is the good man which of these
[00:14:26] three is a liar okay what okay wait so
[00:14:29] Joyce okay I'm gonna a b c this no
[00:14:32] actually that's dumb okay Joy says
[00:14:33] Philip is either the good or bad okay
[00:14:35] then Philip says either Howard or Joyce
[00:14:38] is good
[00:14:39] so let's say Philip is telling the truth
[00:14:44] oh I see what's happening
[00:14:47] oh I see what's happening okay wait I
[00:14:49] need to think of my head okay okay so
[00:15:06] wait okay so the thing is okay here's
[00:15:08] the thing so the liar could say anything
[00:15:10] okay so hear me out so
[00:15:13] if if Philip is either good or bad
[00:15:17] like if Joyce is telling the truth then
[00:15:19] that means Philip can't be the liar if
[00:15:21] Joyce is badge
[00:15:25] then she'd be lying which means that
[00:15:28] Philip would be the liar
[00:15:31] the liar
[00:15:35] wait why is this okay wait
[00:15:42] if Joyce okay let's say Joyce is let's
[00:15:44] say Joyce is good
[00:15:46] then that means Philip has to be if
[00:15:48] Joyce is good Philip has to be bad
[00:15:51] if Joyce is bad Philip has to be a liar
[00:15:54] and if Joyce is a liar it could be
[00:15:56] anything
[00:15:57] Okay then if if let's say Philip is good
[00:16:03] then no Joys can't be good so Philip
[00:16:05] can't be good if Phil wait
[00:16:09] okay so if so Joyce okay so if Philip is
[00:16:12] bad then
[00:16:14] dies and it feels a liar it could no it
[00:16:16] can't because Joyce would be okay so if
[00:16:18] Joyce is telling the truth then that
[00:16:19] can't work okay so that means okay so
[00:16:22] Howard who the [ __ ] is Howard Howard
[00:16:24] sucks balls so
[00:16:28] so let's say Joyce is lying no let's say
[00:16:30] Joyce is bad if Joyce is bad then Philip
[00:16:34] is good no but then she's lying which
[00:16:36] means how it would be good
[00:16:45] which means Joyce is a lot
[00:16:48] is Joyce lying then no wait if Philip's
[00:16:51] bad Joyce is good
[00:16:53] then Howard could be a liar right
[00:16:55] right okay am I wrong wait listen so if
[00:16:58] let's say hypothetically let's say
[00:17:00] hypothetically Joyce is bad if Joyce is
[00:17:02] bad then this is a lie
[00:17:07] oh that means that Philip's a liar and
[00:17:09] then Howard's
[00:17:10] okay wait that doesn't work wait oh okay
[00:17:13] if Joyce is good
[00:17:16] then Philip is the bad man
[00:17:18] and then if Philip's the bad man
[00:17:23] then Batman only lies
[00:17:27] which means Joyce can't be good
[00:17:30] so let's say Joyce is the liar she's
[00:17:31] saying whatever the [ __ ] she wants then
[00:17:33] that means Howard or okay that means
[00:17:36] that Philip let's say Philip is good
[00:17:37] right droid's lies Philip is good if
[00:17:39] Philip is good then that means Howard no
[00:17:41] that can't work so that means let's say
[00:17:43] Philip is a liar then he's saying
[00:17:44] whatever
[00:17:47] yeah what if Joyce's liar if Joyce is a
[00:17:49] liar
[00:18:00] then Howard wait no that doesn't work
[00:18:03] okay Joyce can't be the liar Joyce can't
[00:18:04] be the liar so that means Philip
[00:18:07] let's say Joyce is good that means that
[00:18:09] Philip is bad and then that means he's
[00:18:11] lying which means that Howard is a liar
[00:18:13] okay I'm just but wait could Philip be
[00:18:16] the liar so either it's not Joyce is
[00:18:17] that the Howard or Phillip I think it's
[00:18:19] Howard wait what if it's Philip so let's
[00:18:20] say Philip's a lie right that means
[00:18:21] Joyce is good no Joyce is bad because
[00:18:24] this is a lie which means Philip is a
[00:18:26] liar and then he's just saying whatever
[00:18:28] so this is so Joyce is bad Philip is lie
[00:18:32] and then Howard is good
[00:18:35] right
[00:18:39] if Joyce is bad then she's lying which
[00:18:41] means Philip is the middle which means
[00:18:43] stay in the middle
[00:18:45] which means that Philip is is is is is
[00:18:47] is is is is the liar and then he's
[00:18:50] saying whatever which means that Howard
[00:18:52] is a good man
[00:18:53] so Philip is large please please
[00:18:57] oh I got it
[00:19:01] only took 10 minutes but I got it

[00:23:17] avoid any fake leaks or spoilers don't
[00:23:20] uh open your [ __ ]
[00:23:22] social media apps because people are for
[00:23:25] some I I think they're fake okay anyone
[00:23:27] credible is saying they're not credible
[00:23:29] so it's probably fake
[00:23:31] and I don't talk about leaks on this
[00:23:33] channel but a lot of people are spoiling
[00:23:35] [ __ ] and it's tilting me so I'm gonna
[00:23:37] assume they're fake but either way don't
[00:23:39] talk about them and just I hope they're
[00:23:42] fake
[00:23:43] because also
[00:23:45] uh I mean I tweeted about it she didn't
[00:23:47] see it what the [ __ ] is that

[00:24:02] yeah I think it's like yeah exactly
[00:24:04] people saying like Cloud Chasers I think
[00:24:06] it's that I think it's people that
[00:24:07] aren't actually like reliable like I
[00:24:09] don't I never look at these ever like I
[00:24:11] don't cover that I don't care about it I
[00:24:13] get the point of care wanting to know
[00:24:15] who's next character banners to save
[00:24:16] your Primos I get that you know I get
[00:24:19] that 100 but like story spoilers genuine

[00:24:29] walk into the river take a breath in
[00:24:31] game not real life like why are you like
[00:24:33] what are you doing what are you doing
[00:24:34] but anyway that's probably not real it's
[00:24:36] probably fake but
[00:24:38] I don't know and the worst part is like
[00:24:39] I feel like oh like don't follow them
[00:24:41] yeah I don't follow them but you know
[00:24:43] who does follow them
[00:24:44] a bunch of other people who someone that
[00:24:46] I follow might like a comment that links

[00:24:50] can't Dodge it and there's no spoilers
[00:24:52] you know what the [ __ ] spoiler okay
[00:24:53] you know what the spoiler warnings are I

[00:25:36] [Laughter]
[00:25:40] but
[00:25:43] yeah
[00:25:47] probably fake
[00:25:57] um oh yeah I'm gonna I think it's not
[00:25:59] confirmed but I think I'm gonna be
[00:26:01] streaming Final Fantasy 16 once or twice
[00:26:03] cause it looks fun and I have early
[00:26:07] access to it like the demo so I'll
[00:26:09] probably do a stream if I can hashtag at
[00:26:11] it and then we'll do that and then
[00:26:12] another one I think I'll put it twice
[00:26:14] and see if it's good or not
[00:26:20] glueless I have no glue
[00:26:23] anyways Chad get your time because uh I
[00:26:26] don't want to make Fang weight for six
[00:26:29] years so what we're gonna do is uh do
[00:26:31] our dailies and then do the challenge
[00:26:33] now the things I have to do before we
[00:26:35] start are I need to make sure all my
[00:26:37] characters are geared and almost all of
[00:26:38] them are but for yai Miko
[00:26:42] who is a pink character which may have
[00:26:45] uh relevance later on in this story
[00:26:47] Quest so keep that in mind uh I just got
[00:26:50] cucuroseverity and it's only level 80
[00:26:52] and you're like dogs why is it level
[00:26:55] so we're gonna have to travel to Great
[00:26:57] Britain to kill [ __ ] Rift wolves uh
[00:26:59] it's not gonna be fun but we have to do
[00:27:01] that we have to spend a little bit of
[00:27:02] resin not all necessarily all of it but
[00:27:03] at least a little bit and I need to do

[00:28:25] this account prob arguably the best
[00:28:27] account ever in the world so it's like

[00:28:59] Jazz thanks though tier one
[00:29:02] wow we got three per million artifacts
[00:29:04] and they all suck I mean I guess this

[00:29:20] my kitchen is C3 troll despair
[00:29:24] okay your constellations are kind of
[00:29:25] coped you but like she's a really good

[00:29:46] days actually I forgot
[00:29:50] and you don't even need a good dendro
[00:29:52] character with it like you could use any
[00:29:53] dendro it doesn't have to be a fast
[00:29:54] intro because you're just aggravating

[00:36:27] today
[00:36:29] oh it's like this shot listen to myself
[00:36:31] and I'm like dude what the [ __ ] is this
[00:36:34] guy saying
[00:36:41] well I feel like I've another parametric
[00:36:43] in like a year is it
[00:36:45] oh yeah
[00:36:49] oh
[00:36:53] oh
[00:37:02] yeah
[00:37:11] hey fob wait
[00:37:14] what just happened
[00:37:16] father quotated me
[00:37:18] I got a phone notification
[00:37:27] what is this NPC EDM it's my starting
[00:37:29] student playlist
[00:37:30] freak you
[00:37:32] I created Another Universe and founded
[00:37:35] Paradise for I official he said I'm okay
[00:37:39] with design leaks maybe even kid leaks
[00:37:40] just to get a little taste but story
[00:37:41] leagues are so unclassy it feels like
[00:37:43] many people originally took up Lika as
[00:37:44] their career path on Twitter that they
[00:37:46] all fight for visibility and spend the
[00:37:47] show with no thought SMH
[00:37:49] okay I'm gonna do the xqc take and just
[00:37:51] say interesting and then not react any
[00:37:53] further
[00:37:56] to be fair I think some people are kind
[00:37:58] of like just say [ __ ] to store [ __ ]
[00:38:00] without actually any credibility
[00:38:03] that aren't like but I also just don't
[00:38:06] look at leaks so
[00:38:07] yeah
[00:38:09] I just think uh I think quest spoilers
[00:38:11] are weird champ like I don't get it I
[00:38:13] don't get it I actually don't like if
[00:38:15] you're like oh but what about the people
[00:38:16] who only play gentian for a character
[00:38:18] okay I don't care I only play for Xiao I
[00:38:21] don't want to know if Xiao dies shut the
[00:38:22] [ __ ] up
[00:38:33] I wanna okay listen the only time you
[00:38:36] can spoil a quest for me is if [ __ ]
[00:38:38] I'll hike them rips his shirt off then
[00:38:40] it's fine if he oils up and starts
[00:38:42] twerking let me know but other than that
[00:38:44] [ __ ] why are you spoiling things
[00:38:47] if it's a character Banner you do you
[00:38:49] but if it's a [ __ ] like important
[00:38:51] part of a quest that's not out [ __ ]
[00:38:54] you know
[00:39:17] laughs
[00:39:25] why are people saying finally
[00:39:28] what does that mean
[00:39:30] finally a good stream what does that
[00:39:32] mean
[00:39:36] okay
[00:39:37] um before we do the content for the day
[00:39:40] let me do one quick Abyss clear with
[00:39:41] alhitham then we gear every character
[00:39:43] then we go that's the plan boom maybe
[00:39:45] spend a little bit of resin because I
[00:39:46] probably should but I'm gonna speed on
[00:39:48] this because I need background footage
[00:39:51] it doesn't have to be like a
[00:39:52] particularly good clear it doesn't
[00:39:53] really matter because I have a lot of
[00:39:54] algorithm footage but yeah
[00:39:56] it's awesome worried you're becoming
[00:39:58] normal
[00:39:59] true I've always been normal thanks for
[00:40:01] that uh uh thanks that message actually
[00:40:03] true actually true actually true
[00:40:06] uh a high thumb's definitely better
[00:40:08] first half right yeah
[00:40:09] yeah but this guy's I mean [ __ ]
[00:40:11] resistant to dendro and these guys suck
[00:40:13] balls
[00:40:15] this guy's also dude why is everyone
[00:40:18] immune to dendro or resistant to dendro
[00:40:22] dude ew
[00:40:31] wait that's actually the strength of Al
[00:40:32] Haytham that I get to put in the video
[00:40:34] now that I didn't think about well I
[00:40:35] thought about it but I didn't
[00:40:36] mention it yet
[00:40:39] so now I can write it down
[00:40:48] oh what is this Ox well his team damage
[00:40:50] is [ __ ] high on top of just him so
[00:40:52] even if the enemy is danger resistant
[00:40:53] [ __ ] guess what yolan guess what
[00:40:55] [ __ ] bait I guess you're playing
[00:40:57] kooky but guess what the other
[00:40:58] characters in your team are doing
[00:40:59] [ __ ] destroying their anus true true
[00:41:01] w
[00:41:05] ow don't gear no no I'm not I'm not
[00:41:07] letting uh no
[00:41:10] okay
[00:41:11] um let's just go I think all right so
[00:41:13] far we're good so I'll hide them uh
[00:41:15] yilon probably I'm not gonna do a non-uh
[00:41:18] Nikita team as well but we can do that
[00:41:20] later
[00:41:25] second half
[00:41:31] Shadow what's okay so I've cleared
[00:41:32] second I've cleared many different
[00:41:34] second half teams uh genuine but what's
[00:41:36] a consistent one where I can turn my
[00:41:38] brain off probably shangling yeah why am
[00:41:40] I asking it's just strangling it's just
[00:41:41] strangling it's it's always strangling
[00:41:43] it always was changing it always will be
[00:41:45] shingling it's probably just shangling
[00:41:47] Bennett [ __ ] dendro
[00:41:49] Hydro
[00:41:52] but nahidas on my first half I guess you
[00:41:55] don't need it like I could just do like
[00:41:56] Galileo first off but
[00:42:00] no but the thing about that team is you
[00:42:02] don't have a shield like I kind of want
[00:42:03] to be bright like super brain dead like
[00:42:05] I want to like turn my brain off Windows
[00:42:07] XP spoon
[00:42:08] [Music]
[00:42:17] wait can I shangling Kirara surely
[00:42:27] wait she took the mask off and then put
[00:42:29] it back on and has green hair
[00:42:32] chat I know who cookie is
[00:42:35] look she took the mask off and she's
[00:42:37] gonna put it back on
[00:42:45] um okay wait what's my QR con C2

[00:43:25] all right second off shangling Bennett
[00:43:29] xq
[00:43:31] what if we do Kirara for comfort is it
[00:43:33] gonna be enough dendro wait yeah surely
[00:43:35] it's fun do you even need that much
[00:43:36] gendro surely it's fine right
[00:43:39] no way Kirara can't do [ __ ] actually
[00:43:41] what if we do like
[00:43:43] cavi
[00:43:45] well I actually want to try cavi
[00:44:00] um
[00:44:02] Big T National
[00:44:05] no way no way this is a team
[00:44:11] kirara's only problem is when I'm in
[00:44:13] meow form I can't Auto attack so
[00:44:15] signature doesn't get much value but I
[00:44:16] don't think it usually matters because
[00:44:18] they were fighting shields anyways
[00:44:21] foreign
[00:44:32] National please is that are people
[00:44:34] actually playing this surely nobody is
[00:44:37] playing this team
[00:44:48] me
[00:44:50] all right fine
[00:44:52] she's on low ER though because she's
[00:44:54] built for a [ __ ] freeze team so oh

[00:45:27] here you are
[00:45:33] dude what just happened
[00:45:35] I see everything uh actually dogs have
[00:45:38] you considered that it might be a skill
[00:45:39] issue
[00:45:43] have you considered that
[00:45:48] remember
[00:45:53] I'm just gonna do like a short rotation
[00:45:55] probably should have plunge attack like
[00:45:57] how old do you plunge but all good

[00:59:33] mean I guess intro's on socks so I get
[00:59:35] my burst back instantly it's just so

[01:00:04] rate freeze build so it's not gonna be
[01:00:06] good in that team so like it's yeah it's
[01:00:09] obviously it's not gonna be like that
[01:00:11] good damage but that's kind of like I

[01:00:14] a melt team
[01:00:16] oh I forgot what this was oh
[01:00:19] I didn't even mark it
[01:00:24] okay I didn't know my uh yilon was low
[01:00:26] on energy so we have to like [ __ ]

[01:00:40] stay in the middle I play the fiddle no
[01:00:45] time for riddles

[01:00:53] uh because I I don't I can't really do
[01:00:56] the rotation without yalon's verse
[01:00:57] because elon's a big part of that this
[01:00:58] team's damage against that
[01:01:01] maybe I start with that height for me so
[01:01:02] it goes on cooldown and I get energy
[01:01:08] wait I forgot how high to me is not a
[01:01:09] source of
[01:01:15] wait Cookie's dead
[01:01:17] how did cookie die
[01:01:19] oh yeah

[01:02:23] well now
[01:02:26] I'm just gonna wait I actually don't
[01:02:28] [ __ ] care anymore I'm just gonna wait

[01:02:55] miscalculated
[01:03:13] how did you first try this well okay I
[01:03:16] was playing a different team and also if
[01:03:18] I'm like just going for a clear it's a
[01:03:20] lot easier but I kind of want it to be a
[01:03:21] good clear you got me press one nine one
[01:03:23] four two two one six three balls one if

[01:04:20] double Hydro but not solo Hydro so yeah
[01:04:23] I might not use this footage like I
[01:04:25] don't have enough VR
[01:04:28] elimination
[01:04:45] I don't know
[01:05:06] why this [ __ ] a shark
[01:05:14] Yolanda doesn't have enough yard to be
[01:05:16] to be if we're being honest honest

[01:07:12] like like a tentacing not real probably
[01:07:15] probably probably probably
[01:07:17] surely surely
[01:07:40] wowzox I'm really glad that I was there
[01:07:43] in the part of your stream where you got
[01:07:44] the Vermillion inimo goblet you've
[01:07:46] always been looking for
[01:07:48] wow
[01:07:49] wow
[01:08:20] what
[01:08:22] happened

[01:08:35] thing
[01:08:42] why is he in Vermilion again I'm not I
[01:08:45] just I died in abyss and I I had to go
[01:08:47] to my safe space
[01:08:51] wait did I not apply I thought of my
[01:08:53] curatory
[01:09:13] what's up
[01:09:20] oh crit damage attack yeah this could be
[01:09:23] good maybe I think it's a critter it
[01:09:24] would be good we can level that
[01:09:32] okay what is happening to my map when I
[01:09:34] open it too fast it's like when you get
[01:09:36] up too fast and like you're dizzy is
[01:09:37] that like what was happening to my game
[01:09:39] when I open my map
[01:09:48] chat let's recognize the amount of
[01:09:50] mental strength it takes to have a 70
[01:09:52] gigabyte game with open world 4 massive
[01:09:55] regions dozen of domains 60 plus
[01:09:57] characters and still Farm the same
[01:09:58] domain every single day for two years
[01:10:00] that's dedication
[01:10:03] dude what does that even mean
[01:10:06] I don't do this because I want to I do
[01:10:08] it because I have to it's different we
[01:10:10] are not the same
[01:10:11] all right before we hand the account
[01:10:14] over and start the challenge thing
[01:10:18] let's make sure all of our characters
[01:10:20] are geared to make it like
[01:10:23] Fang proof like to make it to where
[01:10:25] there are no mistakes possible
[01:10:29] 96 223 40f primordial J cutter official
[01:10:34] stringless
[01:10:35] 2-2 good enough
[01:10:37] uh crit damage is a little low
[01:10:39] we could use for a little bit more of
[01:10:42] the crit d
[01:10:45] oh
[01:10:55] oh
[01:10:58] yeah
[01:11:02] let's be real no way she's using Sino so
[01:11:04] we could just un gear a sign of Boom
[01:11:06] sign on official sit um no I'm I'm yeah
[01:11:08] I mean this
[01:11:14] now we want crit rate
[01:11:19] don't Omega LOL Sino what did Sino do
[01:11:21] sino's good
[01:11:24] uh that's pretty good Kirara meow for
[01:11:27] Depot we're chilling kazua forward is
[01:11:29] inventor Freedom sworn uh enough ER 166
[01:11:32] ciao ciao
[01:11:34] Sino good enough yay Miko really good
[01:11:37] the only problem with our eye is the
[01:11:39] weapon is level 80. so whoa whoa I think
[01:11:42] we'd use Alice for now and then we'll
[01:11:43] level this later I mean level 80
[01:11:44] honestly level 80 cougars might actually
[01:11:47] still be better I don't actually know
[01:11:48] but it's probably close enough to where
[01:11:50] I'm just gonna do Alice uh I'll probably
[01:11:52] level it later though
[01:11:55] wait what is the
[01:12:00] yeah this actually it has to be better
[01:12:02] still
[01:12:04] you can check us too much crit rate [ __ ]
[01:12:05] you
[01:12:06] foreign
[01:12:08] but like there are Catchings usually on
[01:12:11] a different weapon so yeah
[01:12:14] our kitchen is usually on um
[01:12:16] on this but then if I give this I'll
[01:12:18] hide them it [ __ ] a hot like if I steal
[01:12:19] this when I hide them okay that's not
[01:12:21] the right but like
[01:12:26] sorry that was toxic okay true but like
[01:12:28] I don't I don't know I think we're on
[01:12:29] the wrong
[01:12:36] there's not really much I could do about
[01:12:38] it it's just like innate because I I
[01:12:40] need to use the circuit
[01:12:43] is
[01:12:50] because like usually I can go crit rate
[01:12:52] yeah it's fine
[01:12:55] Ryden
[01:12:58] good I'll hide them
[01:13:01] good I'm out then ratio is better if I
[01:13:03] go Jade cutter because it's really hard
[01:13:05] to get
[01:13:06] uh good crit ratio with light of foliar
[01:13:09] incision
[01:13:10] but this is like as good as we could do
[01:13:12] so it's pretty good
[01:13:13] nahida

[01:31:12] top I literally felt like
[01:31:15] scary I felt like I was going into a
[01:31:17] domain and I was like if I can make it
[01:31:19] down so um in conclusion I almost fell
[01:31:23] on a walk but dude it's so steep it's
[01:31:26] like terrifying anyways we're talking
[01:31:29] about here is wonderful
[01:31:32] I've landed the perfect job
[01:31:41] I think
[01:32:00] oh anyways well I need to delete this I
[01:32:02] don't want to see it in my [ __ ]
[01:32:03] bottle
[01:32:05] I'm are you ready
[01:32:07] can you sit still for like just let me
[01:32:09] record an intro like a minute

[01:32:17] don't look awkward like it's not like
[01:32:19] I'm forcing you to be here
[01:32:28] [Music]
[01:32:32] monkey laugh
[01:32:37] we have to put sheets on you okay okay
[01:32:41] I'm just gonna hurry because
[01:32:52] you're off looking at chat oh
[01:32:57] I see myself in worse lighting
[01:33:10] anyways
[01:33:15] sorry okay
[01:33:18] I want to start with it today
[01:33:22] I'm gonna clap so that
[01:33:27] just making sure
[01:33:34] wait this music's throwing me off
[01:33:35] there's so many lyrics
[01:33:38] now let's do a song with no lyrics
[01:33:42] okay we're good
[01:33:44] today special challenge
[01:33:48] what is it you ask thanks good question
[01:33:52] today we're gonna be doing something
[01:33:53] special as you know every time I enter
[01:33:56] the abyss I can clear it without fail no
[01:33:58] deaths and honestly I don't even take
[01:34:00] damage so with that knowledge I figured
[01:34:03] we should do something different okay we
[01:34:06] should
[01:34:07] since the carnabis is arguably but also
[01:34:10] objectively the hardest one we've ever
[01:34:12] had and the most restrictive one I
[01:34:13] figured what if we chucked a casual for
[01:34:16] fun player who's abyssophobic they're
[01:34:19] afraid of the Abyss never clears the
[01:34:20] abyss place for Fun and that's cool what
[01:34:22] if we took them track them in the best
[01:34:24] so joining me today
[01:34:29] she wants to be here she's having fun
[01:34:37] a while ago flashback to that I've
[01:34:39] landed the perfect job yeah it was
[01:34:41] pretty chaotic so instead of fixing so
[01:34:44] we tried to fix that account
[01:34:46] we mostly did but I felt like if I it
[01:34:49] would be better content if I gave her
[01:34:51] arguably the best account to ever
[01:34:52] account my account oh docs what's the
[01:34:55] crit damage on your kitchen oh let me
[01:34:57] show you let me show you oh oh is that
[01:34:59] over 300 oh my God oh my God
[01:35:02] that's not even a good build but you get
[01:35:04] the point so we're gonna I geared every
[01:35:05] character I just messed up kaching
[01:35:10] so I geared like every character
[01:35:12] have all the weapons levels Talon mats I
[01:35:15] own every single character in the game I
[01:35:18] said what if we put Fang into the abyss
[01:35:20] maybe like what type of player is she so
[01:35:21] you guys saw you might have seen the
[01:35:23] account review
[01:35:24] their account was a bit disastrous but
[01:35:26] that doesn't mean their gameplay is
[01:35:30] their gameplay could best be described
[01:35:32] as trying to brush your teeth without a
[01:35:34] toothbrush you put your toothpaste I'd
[01:35:36] use this analogy a lot but only stream
[01:35:38] viewers know that because YouTube
[01:35:41] it's like it's like trying to you put
[01:35:43] toothpaste on your finger right because
[01:35:45] you don't have a toothbrush you forgot
[01:35:46] it dropped it lost I kept it I like at
[01:35:47] home when you're traveling so you're
[01:35:48] trying to brush your teeth with your
[01:35:49] finger it's not really working but it's
[01:35:51] better than nothing
[01:35:55] so
[01:35:58] we're gonna see if she can do the abyss
[01:36:00] and every time she dies we'll do a
[01:36:02] temple she dies I-10 Bull with my own
[01:36:05] money on my account which is not
[01:36:07] something I want to do because I have
[01:36:08] yai and won't activate constellations
[01:36:10] and I have yaoi Mia and one activate
[01:36:11] conversations but
[01:36:14] getting kirata constellations would be
[01:36:16] cool because meow
[01:36:17] wait I didn't hold the
[01:36:19] anyways because so we want cure rc6 but
[01:36:22] we don't want five stars
[01:36:23] also
[01:36:26] I don't want this intro to be long
[01:36:32] but also reminder she's a casual player
[01:36:35] who plays for fun
[01:36:36] and you can play how you want to play so
[01:36:38] every comment better be nice
[01:36:41] don't be mean to them you can enjoy
[01:36:43] gentian without being skilled out of
[01:36:45] this that's fine it the better you the
[01:36:47] better you are at Abyss the less grass
[01:36:49] you touch true I never
[01:36:53] foreign
[01:36:58] but for example Fang what is hyperblue
[01:37:03] I'm sorry
[01:37:05] so we're gonna let her I'm gonna try not
[01:37:08] to help too much I'll try not to help
[01:37:10] let her do her thing if there's
[01:37:11] questions I'll answer them I'll try not
[01:37:12] to help letter do your thing on my
[01:37:14] account with whatever she wants for 11
[01:37:16] and 12 fully cleared every death is a
[01:37:19] temple for me
[01:37:22] so there's a punishment every time she
[01:37:24] dies but she'll have the adequate
[01:37:26] resources to thrive
[01:37:32] oh it's all coming out now
[01:37:35] why are you laughing you can't even hear
[01:37:36] it
[01:37:38] oh it's all coming out now
[01:37:46] wait why does spamming spacebar in place
[01:37:48] not work with Kirara does everyone know
[01:37:51] yeah I know zox okay
[01:37:56] okay I think that's it for like the
[01:37:58] intro so now you're gonna
[01:38:01] so you're I'm gonna okay here's what I'm
[01:38:02] gonna do I'm Gonna Let You on the
[01:38:03] account I geared all the characters but
[01:38:05] you can change anything you can look at
[01:38:06] the builds you can gear them yourself do
[01:38:08] whatever you want you literally have all
[01:38:10] of these weapons you have all of these
[01:38:12] artifacts amazing artifacts but I'll
[01:38:13] click on a random one eyes closed this
[01:38:15] is what you're working with
[01:38:16] oh
[01:38:17] sorry that was a bit
[01:38:21] anyways
[01:38:22] um
[01:38:23] so you should be fine but you know no
[01:38:26] pressure as I said people will be nice
[01:38:28] we understand you haven't done this
[01:38:29] Abyss yet their Abyss is eight three
[01:38:31] they legit do not clear a business
[01:38:32] that's okay
[01:38:41] for this like do you want me to
[01:38:45] I don't even I don't even chat chat she

[01:40:43] I just said like be nice and comments
[01:40:45] and stuff oh oh yeah also also I'm
[01:40:48] talking to okay listen this is important
[01:40:50] this is important because I'm a nice guy
[01:40:51] I'm a nice guy but I have I have demons
[01:40:54] they call me the semen demon I have
[01:40:55] demons so listen listen this is what I'm
[01:40:57] gonna say okay I have never I love clip
[01:41:00] channels because I think they're good
[01:41:01] because I help them grow and they help
[01:41:03] me and it's a good and it's cool people
[01:41:05] like them and [ __ ] twitch I'd rather
[01:41:07] watch some [ __ ] on YouTube so I love
[01:41:08] them however when I'm making a dedicated
[01:41:11] video that's meant to be a video Don't
[01:41:13] re-upload the whole thing as like uh
[01:41:16] like ziox does this and that's literally
[01:41:18] the video I want to upload so you can
[01:41:20] still use Clips on the stream but don't
[01:41:21] just like be like
[01:41:23] the same [ __ ] that I want to do in its
[01:41:25] entirety and then make it into YouTube
[01:41:26] video so don't do that if you do I have
[01:41:28] never ever told anyone to take any video
[01:41:31] down ever and I don't want to but if you
[01:41:33] literally upload this whole stream as
[01:41:35] what I want to make it for my main
[01:41:36] Channel I might have to I don't want to
[01:41:38] so just don't do that you can still clip
[01:41:40] it like I'm not mad at anyone you still
[01:41:42] clip it do what you want but don't like
[01:41:43] use everything just still make it like a
[01:41:45] funny clip thing or whatever you want
[01:41:46] okay I'm just saying this so that
[01:41:48] there's a disclaimer because I'm not mad
[01:41:50] at anyone it's all good I just don't you
[01:41:52] know that's all
[01:41:56] just because like I want there to be
[01:41:57] clip channels because I think they're
[01:41:58] cool like I'm not you know I think
[01:42:00] they're cool so I want that to keep
[01:42:01] happening just I don't want my like

[01:53:30] to protect them all that's because every
[01:53:31] enemy's gonna try to hit
[01:53:34] education time classroom is out with
[01:53:37] monoliths and email really helps you can
[01:53:39] suck all the enemies together group them
[01:53:40] away from the monolith and like displace
[01:53:42] them so they can't hit it so it makes it

[01:53:45] for us we're not running any demo
[01:53:47] supports in either half so that's gonna
[01:53:48] be fun also in case you're wondering

[01:54:10] them away but then okay

[01:56:47] so okay wait not only not only is it a
[01:56:49] skill issue but it's also not used to it

[01:56:55] Abyss right and then like the timer
[01:56:56] would still keep going but the enemies
[01:56:58] wouldn't spawn so I would just be
[01:57:00] standing there watching my stars
[01:57:02] disappear but the enemies wouldn't show
[01:57:04] up so I like at some point I just quit

[02:06:49] uh right in for y'all
[02:06:56] no
[02:06:57] if you're on an actual team you would do
[02:06:59] like
[02:07:01] you kind of want an email because I
[02:07:02] don't think you're gonna be fine against
[02:07:04] the monolith but with that said you
[02:07:06] probably want dendro because I don't
[02:07:07] think he'd be fighting against the Enemy
[02:07:08] No not Chow
[02:07:11] what did you just say no to you okay
[02:07:14] you could do like by uh
[02:07:18] who is that I'm kidding you could just
[02:07:20] put nahida there and then
[02:07:23] nagito's here
[02:07:24] yeah but why
[02:07:26] what do you mean what are you playing
[02:07:29] virgin Mia
[02:07:31] I don't know what that means
[02:07:35] whatever that means okay so who do I put
[02:07:38] here
[02:07:39] however you want in a zoom again because
[02:07:41] women are always right
[02:07:47] okay this
[02:07:52] hurry up
[02:07:55] that is wonderful okay
[02:07:58] I don't want to start this and this with
[02:08:00] so much anxiety already like
[02:08:13] gonna [ __ ] you but
[02:08:17] oh wait wait no what about Chiara
[02:08:23] she has a shield doesn't she
[02:08:25] what if I meow
[02:08:29] okay stop don't give me that copium look
[02:08:32] seriously
[02:08:34] hey the thing is not good but it'll be
[02:08:36] fine because you have normal attack
[02:08:37] damage on the floor so your meal is
[02:08:38] better than a normal whatever that means
[02:08:41] what about Tomah okay there you can wait
[02:08:46] Tian oh it's probably better because but
[02:08:48] he's not fully young but Tom was
[02:08:50] probably better because
[02:08:51] you're not gonna proc birds in a single
[02:08:52] time
[02:08:55] is it bad to proc whatever you're saying
[02:08:57] so okay if you want a frog version is
[02:09:00] that French word if you let me explain
[02:09:02] okay hydro and dendro love each other
[02:09:04] they make a child called Bloom okay
[02:09:06] virgin comes in pyro big dick pyro user
[02:09:08] comes in what's up I'm pyro he hits a
[02:09:11] core a dendro core gets hit it explodes
[02:09:14] that's version okay
[02:09:15] it's not good it's good but you owe me a
[02:09:18] can't proc it because can't really
[02:09:19] pocket because you have to hit the cores
[02:09:21] with pyro your Mia doesn't really hit
[02:09:22] things other than enemies okay

[02:30:56] it's literally I'm not gonna spoil it
[02:30:58] you'll see what is this
[02:31:02] okay the this already looks terrifying
[02:31:05] but this looks like the dad of this
[02:31:08] one the only thing I want to say is that
[02:31:10] your team building isn't [ __ ] I'm not
[02:31:12] gonna like spoil you need but for this
[02:31:15] can you actually help me he has he has a
[02:31:17] hydro hydroshield okay a fight up
[02:31:21] sorry Hydro pyro and cryo so you need
[02:31:24] something that beats hydros like dendro
[02:31:26] he's something that beats pyro so Hydro
[02:31:28] that's something that beats Electro so
[02:31:30] like pyro or anything but that says
[02:31:32] Frost uh sorry yeah cryo
[02:31:35] what did I say
[02:31:36] oh cryo not Electro you cry out so it's
[02:31:38] it's he has cryoshield hydro shield
[02:31:40] Powershell so why is that purple
[02:31:42] I don't know I said Electro whatever but
[02:31:43] yeah cross Shield hydroshield Powershell
[02:31:45] wait are you sure there's no Electro why
[02:31:46] is it purple no you need pyro you need
[02:31:48] pyro and then selling for flame so you
[02:31:50] need one pyro for this four at least one
[02:31:53] pyro because there's a crowd Shield here
[02:31:54] and a hydro shield here so usually you
[02:31:56] want pyro plus something else usually
[02:31:57] Hydro for the flame and then for
[02:32:00] this guy you want either dendro or cryo
[02:32:02] a dendro works better
[02:32:04] and then first half do whatever we want
[02:32:05] you want so the only thing about is the
[02:32:07] second half elements you want pyro for
[02:32:08] sure and either
[02:32:10] Hydro okay or cryo and then your other
[02:32:14] element is either dendro cryo usually
[02:32:15] dendro
[02:32:19] wait so
[02:32:23] so example I'm not gonna give you a good
[02:32:25] team I'm just gonna give you the
[02:32:26] elements so example would be like fire
[02:32:28] water yes this is like example keep
[02:32:32] pandas
[02:32:33] and then example first whatever you want

[02:47:45] yeah event of a challenge okay down
[02:47:48] well I guess it's never happening

[02:47:53] floor
[02:47:54] yeah you're not done you have to redo it
[02:47:56] yes 12-1 second half is the hardest part
[02:47:58] spoiler it's [ __ ] annoying and then
[02:48:00] when you're done killing them they get
[02:48:01] shields it's not [ __ ] fun you'll see
[02:48:02] but you can do it again you could use
[02:48:04] this in here if you want I just change
[02:48:05] your shiny weapon
[02:48:08] VR
[02:48:09] so that make her like
[02:48:12] that okay
[02:48:14] no I change a weapon to make her worse
[02:48:17] yeah it does I don't remember what who
[02:48:20] it was your second half was really good
[02:48:21] your first half was okay it could be
[02:48:24] better but it was okay all right who
[02:48:26] would you pick kitchen
[02:48:29] ciao but I don't think you can nothing
[02:48:35] okay Beto's actually broken really yeah
[02:48:37] okay what do I do with Vado
[02:48:41] Chad do you think she'll die if Beto's
[02:48:43] on serpent spine
[02:48:46] yeah anyways wait I okay what
[02:48:54] okay
[02:48:55] but stop using your popcorn and help me
[02:48:58] pick it up okay
[02:49:00] don't grab with your fingers and put the
[02:49:02] buttery fingers on my keyboard
[02:49:06] why is there toilet paper on my desk ask
[02:49:08] yourself that
[02:49:11] anywhere
[02:49:13] all right so like
[02:49:15] Okay so
[02:49:17] you we'll put the same team you put okay
[02:49:20] wait what was the order that you care I
[02:49:22] don't know
[02:49:23] I was just reading from what Chad said
[02:49:27] what's the order I play then your first
[02:49:29] half if you want to do without you can
[02:49:31] it's just the only problem is that was
[02:49:32] good the only problem is your second
[02:49:33] team uses sync trouble so you'd have to
[02:49:35] do your lawn only hydro which is fine
[02:49:36] but it can be kind of
[02:49:39] um oh wasn't it
[02:49:42] something sure a better team would be
[02:49:47] because uh this Abyss has Beto's really
[02:49:50] good when enemies are exactly two at a
[02:49:51] time this Abyss is two at a time so it
[02:49:53] was really good but you could also just
[02:49:54] do what I did for my first clear was
[02:49:56] Shao farzan or Kuching official this is
[02:49:59] what it is visual then any dendro
[02:50:02] character than any Nemo character wait
[02:50:04] so no Beto
[02:50:07] no but you could also play better
[02:50:08] circuiting
[02:50:11] okay
[02:50:14] you do like Aya tomato
[02:50:22] yo is that your sister
[02:50:25] yeah yo is that ant or Jake in chat oh

[02:54:50] new Abyss guide and this Abyss he will
[02:54:53] be
[02:54:58] I
[02:55:04] by Royal Decree
[02:55:07] with sword come shadow
[02:55:11] I feel like I'm literally gonna lose a
[02:55:14] star just on this floor this first half
[02:55:17] alone
[02:55:22] too bad nowhere to hide cool
[02:55:25] how did you not three star the first
[02:55:28] half
[02:55:29] this is the easy half
[02:55:34] it's the easy half
[02:55:39] it's not about sometimes it's not about
[02:55:41] builds chat and account reviews it's
[02:55:42] about how you play the teams can I
[02:55:45] thanks gameplay is making me want to do
[02:55:46] unspeakable things okay we'll do it
[02:55:50] don't do it don't do it dude yeah
[02:55:56] no it's fine it's fine uh it's not
[02:55:58] really it's just like you don't like not
[02:56:00] knowing how the team works is fine
[02:56:01] because you don't you haven't played
[02:56:02] kachink so okay so the way coaching
[02:56:04] teams work
[02:56:07] no just listen
[02:56:08] yeah because I don't expect this again
[02:56:10] okay so the way of changes work is you
[02:56:12] want to proc aggravate aggravate you use
[02:56:14] dendro
[02:56:16] yes yeah use dendro and then use
[02:56:18] electronic that's it Dental first
[02:56:21] doesn't matter but the thing is well yes
[02:56:24] then refresh like it doesn't matter
[02:56:26] because when you use Electro and dendro
[02:56:28] it creates an aura on an enemy okay
[02:56:32] wipe my head
[02:56:38] okay
[02:56:41] they both stay on the Enemy at the same
[02:56:44] time
[02:56:44] the enemies are both dendro and Electro
[02:56:46] there's a quick and Aura on them then
[02:56:48] when you use Electro on it again
[02:56:50] the dendro stays there and you you buff
[02:56:53] your electric damage that's aggravate
[02:56:54] and because the dendro stays there your
[02:56:56] dendro character doesn't really matter
[02:56:57] it could be anything baiju all you need
[02:56:59] to do is you throw your [ __ ] snake
[02:57:01] [ __ ] at enemies and then that's it and
[02:57:02] then your electrodes boom boom so all
[02:57:04] you need to do in this team
[02:57:06] is
[02:57:07] use official then you use casual to
[02:57:10] swirl the electrode to buff your Electro
[02:57:12] damage causes swirling Electro bus
[02:57:13] Electro damage please listen if you
[02:57:15] don't like a chat
[02:57:16] baiju because I do a temple every time
[02:57:18] you I owe a temple I forgot because you
[02:57:20] reset
[02:57:22] I have to spend money
[02:57:26] okay not a five star kirata oh oh that
[02:57:30] was good
[02:57:31] oh
[02:57:33] anyways as I was explaining all
[02:57:39] okay I explained what the reaction did
[02:57:40] now how you play the team yeah first
[02:57:42] thing you need to know is because you're
[02:57:44] on an artifacts out on kitchen starting
[02:57:45] Fury
[02:57:46] every time you proc a reaction you're
[02:57:49] basically your skill cooldown is really
[02:57:51] low the more you do [ __ ] so you want to
[02:57:54] be spamming or skull catching okay
[02:57:55] something you can do is use your e once
[02:57:57] because you know skill works again
[02:58:01] they do e and then burst and then e
[02:58:03] again
[02:58:04] after that your e will be up again if
[02:58:06] the enemy is dendro so let me show you
[02:58:07] let me show you so if you put dendro on
[02:58:10] an enemy right
[02:58:11] so all you have to do like buy you eat
[02:58:13] right you see this
[02:58:14] look at this cute right then look at my
[02:58:18] ease cooldown so e again look it's back
[02:58:21] up
[02:58:21] because we propped so many reactions
[02:58:23] every time you proc a reaction it lowers
[02:58:25] the scroll down by like around a second
[02:58:27] yes so you can spam it so all you need
[02:58:31] to do to play this team is the following
[02:58:32] you put Electro on the enemies so let's
[02:58:34] say official you summon all right Oz boo
[02:58:36] then you swirl the electrodes dude
[02:58:53] it's a pretty quick swap team meaning
[02:58:55] you're just like spam I swore the wrong
[02:58:56] element but you can just kind of spam
[02:58:58] things go casual go official go buy you
[02:59:01] and then just keep spamming rotations
[02:59:02] you keep swapping keep killing
[02:59:03] everything
[02:59:09] doesn't matter does all you need is a
[02:59:11] bit of dendro his burst his e is he
[02:59:13] throws a snake and heals that's it okay
[02:59:15] it it hits enemies comes back to you
[02:59:17] then it heals after like two seconds
[02:59:18] okay his burst applies dendro every I
[02:59:22] think two seconds or something it
[02:59:23] basically just interval will apply
[02:59:24] dendro and it'll give you a small shield
[02:59:26] and we'll heal you
[02:59:29] okay
[02:59:34] so it's basically he's a Healer yes it
[02:59:37] does he's a Healer that applies under
[02:59:38] that's it that's all that matters
[02:59:41] don't look example oh also you can group
[02:59:43] enemies plants are weird if you look
[02:59:45] like if you're like here they'll like
[02:59:46] teleport in front of you look
[02:59:51] oh like the little like digging yeah
[02:59:52] look they dig you boom and then you
[02:59:54] apply Electro swirl it so you buff all
[02:59:56] your electronics you could use your
[02:59:58] crossovers to be on but dendro then you
[02:59:59] go coaching EQ
[03:00:02] second e
[03:00:03] you had like a turtle talk you could do
[03:00:04] e boom Another enemies are dead and um
[03:00:07] well this guy's not dead but you got the
[03:00:08] point boom you could just like kill them
[03:00:10] do whatever and like feel free to swap
[03:00:12] between characters a lot or attack on
[03:00:13] kaching assuming you're Electro confused
[03:00:15] and then if the enemies are being down
[03:00:16] like this and they're not grouped boom
[03:00:18] you suck them together and then Causeway
[03:00:19] carries
[03:00:21] when you do like the oh I [ __ ] up it
[03:00:23] seems like an emergency
[03:00:32] same for these like these enemies seem
[03:00:34] annoying all you need to do is Boom
[03:00:36] they're [ __ ] grouped and now anything
[03:00:37] you do will hit all of them look I go
[03:00:39] official oh it's I summon the kitchen
[03:00:44] another dead
[03:00:50] what the hell
[03:00:53] that's uh them pushing me or am I like
[03:00:56] when they like I don't know what the
[03:00:58] [ __ ] happened but the triangles
[03:01:00] if you wait too long they go invisible
[03:01:02] and then you have to proc Quicken on
[03:01:03] them which is dendron Electro for them
[03:01:04] to reappear but you don't want that to
[03:01:05] happen just kill them faster
[03:01:07] does that make sense Quicken yeah
[03:01:11] or aggravate or spread it makes Quicken
[03:01:13] and then if you apply electron and it's
[03:01:15] aggravated if you apply dendron it's
[03:01:16] spread I took the reason
[03:01:20] different names
[03:01:22] [ __ ] okay let's call it let's call it
[03:01:24] thunder plant
[03:01:28] does that help

[03:05:14] her out
[03:05:15] what
[03:05:18] like oh you know Ball Ground sticks on

[03:05:45] okay my child is

[03:05:52] try three
[03:05:56] it's a third try already she forgot
[03:05:58] everything I said
[03:06:04] I ran it and then
[03:06:08] okay
[03:06:12] okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay
[03:06:14] okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay
[03:06:17] is there a specific corner you run to
[03:06:19] usually that I should run to as well
[03:06:24] teleport
[03:06:29] oh [ __ ] nowhere to hide
[03:06:33] okay
[03:06:47] do you ever group them successfully ever
[03:06:50] well I mean you did just now but okay
[03:06:58] what went wrong was you caused this
[03:07:01] world nothing then you didn't apply
[03:07:02] dendro and then you're catching to
[03:07:04] nothing so if you want to put characters
[03:07:05] in the order you want to play them you
[03:07:06] can but you do something like Visual and
[03:07:08] then Kazo or baiju but usually official
[03:07:10] kazua baiju kaching
[03:07:23] also with official her burst resets oz
[03:07:26] so all you need to do is e and then save
[03:07:28] your burst for later or burst and save

[03:32:58] were like half HP you almost got it
[03:33:01] you actually almost got it you just
[03:33:03] needed to Shield every time your shields
[03:33:05] were off because they're scary
[03:33:13] okay listen so if you're close
[03:33:16] look you're almost done right at that
[03:33:18] point you can play safe and just Shield
[03:33:19] every time you have it up the way
[03:33:21] throughout Shield work is
[03:33:24] are you okay I don't know what button to
[03:33:26] like switch back to running or whatever
[03:33:29] control
[03:33:30] but if you um with kirara's skill if you
[03:33:34] run through an enemy your Shield gets
[03:33:35] stronger it's usually like one run
[03:33:36] through one or two enemies and get out
[03:33:37] you don't want to stay under you too
[03:33:38] long it's gonna be a lot of attacking
[03:33:39] okay and then you're gonna be spamming
[03:33:41] your Bennett burst to heal and spamming
[03:33:43] your Carrara Shield the heel and then or
[03:33:45] to shield and then your damage comes
[03:33:47] from Synchro and chain link so use
[03:33:49] reverse whenever you have them use your
[03:33:50] skills when you have them and then spam
[03:33:51] your Shield whenever you're like gonna
[03:33:53] die I said I wasn't gonna backseat but I
[03:33:54] feel like I kind of have to because you
[03:33:56] do have to yeah so it's like a helpful
[03:33:58] experience and I have to do Temple
[03:34:00] reminded that every time she dies
[03:34:03] help
[03:34:07] please please stay off or big Tonka tea
[03:34:11] fanary
[03:34:14] I'm happy
[03:34:17] yeah I would be the worst I'd rather
[03:34:18] lose the 50 not the eyes but oh
[03:34:23] okay that's too far
[03:34:25] I'll say five
[03:34:28] that's good I want to lose the 50 50 so
[03:34:30] we're building pity for next character

[04:03:18] okay educate us no I'll let you cook
[04:03:22] my ears
[04:03:24] guys oh my God okay
[04:03:31] what is snapshotting
[04:03:33] wait what
[04:03:36] what is that
[04:03:39] wait hello
[04:03:43] hello it's it's uh oh God it's over okay
[04:03:47] so oh Lord certain abilities
[04:03:50] factor in their stats when you use them
[04:03:52] for the whole duration what
[04:03:54] yeah
[04:03:55] let's say okay let's say you shoot a
[04:03:57] ball okay and then the ball hits someone
[04:03:59] in the face okay okay
[04:04:02] and when you're shooting the ball okay
[04:04:03] you got a blessing on your hand
[04:04:06] okay when you're shooting the ball right
[04:04:09] okay
[04:04:10] you were at your strongest okay
[04:04:12] you're buffed okay you're like really
[04:04:14] you just drank a bunch of caffeine G
[04:04:16] fuel okay
[04:04:17] shoot it the ball spinning really fast
[04:04:20] because you're like super amped up
[04:04:22] you're high you're buff okay when the
[04:04:25] ball hits the opponent or hits whoever
[04:04:27] you shot it at it's gonna hit them hard
[04:04:29] because you're buff whereas if you shoot
[04:04:31] it before your buffing just normal like
[04:04:32] half asleep it's not gonna hurt as much
[04:04:34] right
[04:04:35] so what's not shouting is is the fact
[04:04:37] that the ball carried over your strength
[04:04:40] in its whole spinning whereas some
[04:04:43] abilities don't do that so example
[04:04:45] strangling power NATO if you use it
[04:04:46] before Bennett it's not gonna do a lot
[04:04:48] of damage because Bennett gives you huge
[04:04:50] Buffs but if you use benassalt and then
[04:04:51] use shangling power NATO after Bennett
[04:04:54] it Buffs the power NATO because Bennett
[04:04:55] bust your character right but I'll take
[04:04:57] it one step further when Bennett's alt
[04:04:59] expires the buff expires right
[04:05:02] right
[04:05:03] give me a verbal yes sir yes sir okay
[04:05:07] so but what happens to the pattern what
[04:05:10] do you think happens do you think the
[04:05:11] power needle gets worse stops doing
[04:05:12] damage or does less damage or is it
[04:05:14] better stay just as strong as when
[04:05:16] Bandits was there when it's stage or so
[04:05:17] strong because it's harder from the buff
[04:05:19] start from the bottom now we're here
[04:05:21] yeah yeah so it stays as strong okay
[04:05:25] because you snap that's what
[04:05:27] snapshotting is certain abilities do not
[04:05:28] all of them example of an ability that
[04:05:30] should snapshot but doesn't sing show
[04:05:32] let me leave you
[04:05:34] sing show his burst it lasts a while it
[04:05:37] stays on him so if he's inside a bed
[04:05:38] it's old it Buffs him he does way more
[04:05:40] damage on it he leaves men assault it
[04:05:42] stops getting buffed it stops doing more
[04:05:43] damage but because he doesn't snapshots
[04:05:46] so abilities normally some abilities do
[04:05:48] some of these don't strangling it does
[04:05:49] so you power noodle inside of Bennett
[04:05:51] the last second it's about to disappear
[04:05:52] parido nice
[04:05:56] nice then you run away from betta's
[04:05:57] Circle and guess what you're still
[04:05:59] buffed doesn't matter
[04:06:03] it's like if you're brushing your teeth
[04:06:06] right okay
[04:06:08] you're brushing your teeth you're
[04:06:10] brushing your teeth right butt but but
[04:06:12] but but but
[04:06:15] you're like [ __ ] I'm running out of
[04:06:18] toothpaste so you roll up this you roll
[04:06:20] up the toothpaste you squeeze it out the
[04:06:23] last draw
[04:06:24] the voices but the drop is enough to
[04:06:26] spread around your mouth and clean your
[04:06:28] teeth dental hygiene that is
[04:06:30] snapshotting whereas if you couldn't
[04:06:32] snapshot the last little bit then you
[04:06:34] would put it like you put you'd be
[04:06:36] brushing and then as soon as you're out
[04:06:37] it's out and it expires and then you
[04:06:39] can't brush the rest
[04:06:41] that was even worse yeah that one didn't
[04:06:43] make sense
[04:06:45] it's like you're ordering a meal at
[04:06:46] McDonald's okay you you pull up in the
[04:06:48] drive-through third one welcome to
[04:06:50] macca's rough welcome to Mackie D's Rob
[04:06:53] what's going on guys Asian guy here back
[04:06:56] out again
[04:06:57] they're at McDonald's right
[04:06:59] and they're like hey what would you like
[04:07:01] to order
[04:07:02] and you're like okay
[04:07:04] I want
[04:07:06] oh this is a good analogy so let's say
[04:07:09] there's a limited time sauce limited
[04:07:11] time sauce okay they release barbecue
[04:07:14] Supreme you say hey I'll have a barbecue
[04:07:16] Spring sauce okay then as soon as you
[04:07:18] order right after the words left your
[04:07:21] mouth the deal expires it turns oh all
[04:07:25] day breakfast ends no they have
[04:07:27] breakfast till 10 a.m you order at 10 AM
[04:07:29] 9 59. boom as soon as the words leave
[04:07:33] your mouth it turns 10 a.m if the
[04:07:36] breakfast snapshots you get it even if
[04:07:38] by the time they cook it it's 1005. they
[04:07:40] shouldn't be cooking breakfast at
[04:07:41] [ __ ] 1005 but if you said at 9 59 so
[04:07:44] it's not shotted whereas if it doesn't
[04:07:45] snapshot like sing show instead of uh
[04:07:48] Beto or Shang Ling then what happened is
[04:07:50] you say that 9 59 they start they start
[04:07:53] cooking it ding dong Bing Bong boom it
[04:07:57] turns 10 a.m they stop they say [ __ ] you
[04:07:59] I'm not finishing this it's it's no
[04:08:01] longer breakfast suck my balls go away
[04:08:03] eat a [ __ ] Big Mac
