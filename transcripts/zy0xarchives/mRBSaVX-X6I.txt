[00:30:15] however dude
[00:30:18] I literally
[00:30:21] I'm not kidding Unstoppable swords dude
[00:30:25] everyone like his destruction Liu is so
[00:30:28] ruthless she even attacked her
[00:30:30] apprentice's Apprentice
[00:30:32] and she figured out Yen Ching's fighting
[00:30:34] style just from the sound of his soul
[00:30:36] [ __ ] blade that that hung and then he
[00:30:38] saw her coming my way I can't say I
[00:30:40] blame you
[00:30:41] I mean that's not bad then yeah sure she
[00:30:44] became a different person as for the day
[00:30:47] she crossed paths with Yan Ching it was
[00:30:50] quite the twist of fate I guess so in
[00:30:53] any case Jing Liu is unpredictable at
[00:30:56] the best catching isn't bad stop it yeah
[00:31:03] wait is that more accurate that's her
[00:31:04] right it's actually

[00:31:21] is in prolonged combat oh wait that is
[00:31:23] sick Persona takes over and she changes

[00:31:52] and enters a spectral transmigration
[00:31:55] state in the spectral transmigration
[00:31:57] State Jing Liu's every attack deducts a
[00:32:01] set price
[00:32:02] I don't know who why can't I think of
[00:32:04] who however her attack increases
[00:32:07] according to the corresponding total HP
[00:32:09] consumed ah see I told you she attacks
[00:32:12] her allies while in the spectral
[00:32:15] transmigration State jingliu's skill
[00:32:17] Transcendent flash becomes moon on
[00:32:20] glacial River and she is unable moon on
[00:32:23] glacial River
[00:32:25] wow doesn't consume skill points but

[00:32:59] to sienjo records she was taken by the

[00:33:05] subsequently detained in the shackling
[00:33:06] prison
[00:33:08] with her Apprentice Jin Yuen would come
[00:33:11] later because coming Mara struck is an
[00:33:14] unavoidable fate for sienzhou long life
[00:33:16] species but they're still trying to find
[00:33:19] a way to break free of the cycle yeah

[00:36:02] so but it feels like she's not from the
[00:36:05] law Foo
[00:36:07] of the cienjo ships I think her real
[00:36:11] name was gwenevere or
[00:36:13] [Music]
[00:36:14] or guamin's fine wood Joy Mia oh
[00:36:21] and came up with it for her
[00:36:27] this plus if you think about it
[00:36:28] gwenevere and Gwen knife and do sound
[00:36:31] kind of similar if you say them a few
[00:36:34] times right
[00:36:36] oh we might want to steer clear is there
[00:36:39] an emote called sex alarm or do you guys
[00:36:41] keep spamming that she's fines for that
[00:36:42] uh-huh seriously sanjo culture is vast

[00:42:11] investors and lenders the IPC is a big
[00:42:15] fish and with so many venture capital
[00:42:17] projects there are bound to be bumps in
[00:42:19] the road looking topaz is our go-to
[00:42:22] person to smooth out the bumps and make
[00:42:24] sure we recover what's owed oh get it
[00:42:32] when dealing with defaulters topaz and

[00:42:52] I mean
[00:42:54] within the walls of the IPC there is
[00:42:57] indeed a rumor that topaz is still a
[00:43:00] success might have something of the
[00:43:03] supernatural about it oh

[00:43:09] eyes
[00:43:10] green icing streams close hunting let's

[00:43:18] a certain unmistakable companion I'm
[00:43:21] talking about a warp Trotter number oh
[00:43:24] you probably
[00:43:28] sidekick both at work and out on the
[00:43:31] back
[00:43:32] numbee has a keen sense for sniffing out

[00:43:53] role in title really really and don't
[00:43:57] forget the corporate world mirrors the
[00:43:59] battlefield in more ways than one topaz
[00:44:02] is you're covering the code there's no
[00:44:05] code
[00:44:06] you better believe dumpy please
[00:44:08] please pardon that topaz a number oh my
[00:44:11] God now of course they put it following
[00:44:13] the path of the hunt at the start of an
[00:44:15] outline turn if no enemy on the
[00:44:17] battlefield inflicted with proof of
[00:44:19] death I'm very nice thank you flick this
[00:44:21] state on a random enemy thereby boosting
[00:44:24] the follow-up attack damage they receive
[00:44:26] during battle number starts out with an
[00:44:28] initial speed and acts autonomously he's
[00:44:31] inflicted with proof of death excluding
[00:44:33] number Zone turns every time an ally
[00:44:36] follow-up attack he's an enemy inflicted
[00:44:37] with proof of debt numbers
[00:44:41] like number numpy topaz share a strong
[00:44:44] bond
[00:44:45] [Music]
[00:44:47] get a wish topaz a skill difficult brand
[00:44:51] is able to reallocate proof of debt to a
[00:44:53] different Target allowing numbi to
[00:44:56] immediately launch an assault and deal a
[00:44:57] set percentage of topaz's attack as fire
[00:45:00] damage to the new Target this counts as
[00:45:02] a follow-up attack follow-up attack turn
[00:45:05] a profit allows numbee to enter the
[00:45:08] windfall Bonanza State okay in the state
[00:45:11] that is damage and crit damage terrible
[00:45:13] name both experience and entries wait
[00:45:15] could damage every time an allies basic
[00:45:18] attack skill or ultimate hits an enemy
[00:45:21] inflicted with proof of death numbee's
[00:45:23] action is additionally Advanced forward
[00:45:25] after number launches a set number of
[00:45:28] attacks this effect is dispelled
[00:45:31] whoa okay he's got moves some believe
[00:45:34] that everything possesses
[00:45:37] but if you treat all living things she
[00:45:40] is very corporate regardless of whether
[00:45:42] they're human okay okay okay okay okay
[00:45:45] okay
[00:45:49] you know what you're doing technique
[00:45:51] it's like when you walk around with you
[00:45:53] those topaz to summon numbing when
[00:45:54] entering a map number then automatically
[00:45:57] seeks out basic treasures and Trotters
[00:45:59] within a certain range leading topaz
[00:46:02] right to the loot the best part Striders
[00:46:05] won't be alerted to their approach and
[00:46:07] this effect doesn't even wait that's so
[00:46:09] [ __ ] cute if topaz wait that's so
[00:46:12] cute and then you have to kill the other
[00:46:13] Trotter in front of your Trotter you

[00:55:49] introduce you as a brand new event for
[00:55:51] every room to take part in oh woohoo
[00:55:54] nice recognize universally as the
[00:55:57] leading video game brand ethereum Wars
[00:55:59] is set to unbalance
[00:56:06] ethereum Wars what's that think of it as
[00:56:09] a holographic video game to secure a
[00:56:12] spot in the grand final contestants must
[00:56:15] collect and nurture ether Spirits which
[00:56:18] can be found within Victory zones
[00:56:30] your knowledge in this area is
[00:56:32] surprising I've heard a finger too about
[00:56:34] the ipc's research and cultivation
[00:56:36] programs
[00:56:38] you're right in assuming that the aim of
[00:56:40] this event is to analyze the suitability
[00:56:42] of different species as fighting
[00:56:44] companions correct and we I would
[00:56:47] believe that no real life creatures will
[00:56:50] be harmed during ethereum Wars the IPC
[00:56:53] has renovated an old weapons testing
[00:56:55] ground to serve as a tournament venue
[00:56:57] we've also set up Victory zones in
[00:56:59] different locations space station urillo
[00:57:02] 6 and the siento lawful those who
[00:57:05] managed to defeat the championship
[00:57:06] contenders in each Victory Zone and
[00:57:08] complete the hyperlink challenges will
[00:57:10] be greeted with generous rewards it's
[00:57:13] also worth noting that ether Spirits
[00:57:15] both Allied and enemy alike are
[00:57:17] classified into three what the [ __ ] is
[00:57:19] this mechanical humanoid and aberrant in
[00:57:23] combat these types have a cyclical
[00:57:24] relationship
[00:57:26] wait you get to play as the dudes
[00:57:28] animals that are vulnerable to your
[00:57:31] courageous that's actually kind of cool
[00:57:33] oh so picking a type that counters your
[00:57:36] opponents is super important you got it
[00:57:39] furthermore as you advance through the
[00:57:41] competition you'll gain access to the
[00:57:43] even more formidable Overlord ether
[00:57:46] Spirits which can be developed to boost
[00:57:48] their combat prowess
[00:57:50] so the deeper you delve into the
[00:57:52] competition the fiercer the fights
[00:57:55] become this is gonna be quite the
[00:57:57] contest

[01:12:02] bucko look at his relics okay let's okay
[01:12:06] let's look at let's say I wear to gear
[01:12:08] my genuine right let's say
[01:12:09] hypothetically I were to gear him
[01:12:10] optimally what would he look like okay
[01:12:13] this is a good uh headpiece let's look
[01:12:17] at gloves
[01:12:19] oh that's a good glove okay that's two
[01:12:22] pieces that's two that's two let's look
[01:12:23] at the body let's look at the body do I
[01:12:25] have an electro a lightning body no I
[01:12:27] don't no I don't but do you know what I
[01:12:29] do have I could go to these two piece so
[01:12:31] let's say we want let's say we want
[01:12:33] speed let's say we want attack
[01:12:37] okay I actually don't have a good body
[01:12:39] but dude I can make it work it's not
[01:12:41] even I think the main thing was I didn't
[01:12:43] have a good uh sphere so my two piece is
[01:12:45] [ __ ]
[01:12:51] into background music
[01:12:54] he didn't deserve this dude I never said
[01:12:58] I want to bench him I just don't the
[01:13:01] only dude I'm not trying to level up
[01:13:03] [ __ ]
[01:13:13] okay let me put let me put his his ring
[01:13:15] on and then we'll put
[01:13:20] dude I only have one light cone I could
[01:13:22] use on him
[01:13:23] or I get R5 seriousness of breakfast but
[01:13:26] like I don't wanna I'm not trying to R5
[01:13:28] a seriousness of breakfast
[01:13:36] say you Perma bench it's I play Sino G
[01:13:40] look g-un look look if I didn't like
[01:13:42] genuine he's I wouldn't okay well these
[01:13:44] times are only level six but I wouldn't
[01:13:46] level lightning Lord to [ __ ] eight
[01:13:48] okay I I listen it's a work in progress
[01:13:51] he's not benched
[01:13:55] did my endings like he's not gearing up
[01:13:58] with my entries actually cracked but now
[01:14:00] I'm gonna I'm dude [ __ ] jingly is
[01:14:02] coming out and she looks the same but at
[01:14:04] least she's destruction so maybe maybe I
[01:14:06] won't
[01:14:07] maybe it'll be a different build
[01:14:16] dude look at this look at this look at
[01:14:18] this let's say let's say I can use this
[01:14:19] set right look at this
[01:14:22] look at this first of all these boots
[01:14:23] are insane second of all this [ __ ]
[01:14:26] ball is pretty sick I also have another
[01:14:28] one but I don't know where it is
[01:14:30] yeah there you go I [ __ ] well she
[01:14:33] might want a different ball than
[01:14:35] enter it's Al Soto but whatever
[01:14:37] look at this this is wait where is it
[01:14:40] look
[01:14:45] well this might be I yeah
[01:14:53] just has too much crit rate but I don't
[01:14:56] know maybe
[01:14:57] surely they don't make every ice
[01:14:59] character have a million [ __ ] crit
[01:15:01] rate uh and then I can never use this
[01:15:02] body
[01:15:05] but if I can then uh yeah uh if I can't
[01:15:09] then uh we'll use uh we'll go to these
[01:15:13] two piece all good actually
[01:15:18] yeah there you go crit damage with
[01:15:20] attack percent dude crit damage with
[01:15:22] attack percent look at this [ __ ] it I'll
[01:15:24] level it right now plus nine
[01:15:27] okay we got an attack roll it's fine we
[01:15:30] got an attack roll it's fine dude we we
[01:15:33] got one it's fine it's fine it's
[01:15:36] actually fine that's one and then I have
[01:15:38] dude look at this if I go to PCS 25
[01:15:41] 25 damage attack roll and then two
[01:15:44] Critter eight
[01:15:45] rolls look at that this is insane it's
[01:15:49] on my uh dead hung right now because I
[01:15:51] love that huh ratio oh 76 158 without
[01:15:54] even a crit weapon that is pretty
[01:15:55] impressive that is pretty impressive
[01:15:57] however if I have to give the piece I
[01:16:00] also have the same on the um ignore the
[01:16:02] planner but I also have the same on a on
[01:16:04] a flower hat head does anyone call this
[01:16:07] head I guess headpiece that's what you
[01:16:09] call it so it's like not bad
[01:16:12] wailed every time dude
[01:16:15] not even 134 speed it's 133 Point
[01:16:18] there's a decibel that rounds up to one
[01:16:21] three four surely it's fine shut the
[01:16:22] [ __ ] up dude I just okay so memory
[01:16:25] accounts 12 isn't even hard for me
[01:16:26] anymore so I CL because of that I just
[01:16:28] assume it's 134 okay we just it rounded
[01:16:30] up it rounded up it rounds up there's a
[01:16:33] decibel there's a decimal it rounds up
[01:16:36] it rounded up
[01:16:38] it rounds up
[01:16:40] 12 10.
[01:16:44] dude okay but on ironically though we
[01:16:46] literally Auto battled memory accounts
[01:16:48] until the last [ __ ] chamber
[01:16:51] is what it is
[01:16:56] truly is the harmony set that above
[01:16:57] speed by six percent haha right I mean
[01:16:59] we unironically do
[01:17:01] like I'm not even kidding we do
[01:17:03] see look bronia exactly one less speed
[01:17:06] and she's on the set so technically we
[01:17:08] would go over
[01:17:10] so there you go I was right you were
[01:17:12] wrong you should be ashamed
[01:17:17] also look at this piece 29 crit damage
[01:17:22] 17 crew damage
[01:17:24] and it's not even plus 15. let's close
[01:17:26] 15 it
[01:17:27] [ __ ] it
[01:17:30] if this doesn't roll quick damage though
[01:17:31] you guys are actually the the proof this
[01:17:33] is proof that you guys are my bad luck
[01:17:35] because off stream this would have hit
[01:17:36] good damage
[01:17:38] all right well that is a tragedy
[01:17:43] you slandered brontia when did I slander
[01:17:45] bronia literally when did I slander her
[01:17:48] I like bronia
[01:17:50] okay I I don't okay
[01:17:53] I don't think her alt animation is
[01:17:56] particularly cool it's just a bunch of
[01:17:58] like soldiers
[01:17:59] but like that doesn't mean I don't like
[01:18:01] her
[01:18:07] this is double speed
[01:18:16] huh double speed
[01:18:24] oh dude I need to level links you
[01:18:25] reminded me links is actually kind of
[01:18:27] kind of pogging I actually really like
[01:18:29] links
[01:18:30] she's like she's like she's like four
[01:18:32] star
[01:18:33] um what's his name should I first
[01:18:34] started the wheelchair
[01:18:37] she's pretty sick
[01:18:39] it's pretty cracked
[01:18:41] do I need to level her I was Auto
[01:18:43] battling a bit
[01:18:44] I probably can but yeah
[01:18:54] abundance dies of cringe how is that
[01:18:56] dice of cringe why is everything dies of
[01:18:58] cringe
[01:18:59] why is abundance dies of cringe
[01:19:03] how to switch one for John's good
[01:19:05] you're welcome
[01:19:06] in-depth review she's a pretty uh pretty
[01:19:11] correct um I want to say I almost had
[01:19:13] shelter but she's not a shielder she'll
[01:19:15] just uh like tank damage for you and
[01:19:17] then heal some of it back
[01:19:28] wait she looks at me
[01:19:30] I forgot that these characters follow
[01:19:31] you when you zoom in well actually even
[01:19:33] when you don't zoom in but you can't
[01:19:34] really notice it
[01:19:37] dude why You Look At Me
[01:19:49] do that on Ting you and why why
[01:19:57] dude she's so short look at this
[01:20:06] dude why is everyone of everyone I said
[01:20:08] that everyone of my channel was typing
[01:20:09] aware and then the one person laughing
[01:20:11] was Ting yoon's crack neck
[01:20:13] okay every time every time I see this
[01:20:15] person in Chad they get a timeout
[01:20:17] increasingly long time out every time
[01:20:23] I don't know why that that name doesn't
[01:20:24] make sense fine I don't know what you're
[01:20:26] saying
[01:20:40] all right I should probably go back to
[01:20:42] sleep because it's early sorry I'm a bit
[01:20:45] dead I didn't caffeinate and then
[01:20:46] tonight we'll play gunshin
[01:20:50] or Star rail I don't know
[01:20:55] what's your team Yoon built
[01:20:58] um speed and attack but sometimes I put
[01:21:00] defensive stats on her so she doesn't
[01:21:01] get [ __ ] one-shotted but generally
[01:21:03] just speed attack I use Von walk ER rope
[01:21:05] and then the a weapon that gives energy
[01:21:07] because I need to get my ALT as fast as
[01:21:10] possible for Dan Hong ill but usually it
[01:21:13] doesn't matter that much well it might
[01:21:15] matter actually depends
[01:21:18] thank you
[01:21:30] how many hours from now is your Night's
[01:21:32] Dream okay there's no promises I'll try
[01:21:35] to stream tonight if not I'll stream
[01:21:37] tomorrow if I can stream tonight that
[01:21:39] would be in like 12 plus one hour like
[01:21:42] 13 to 14 hours 13.
[01:21:44] I'll try I'll generate a try because
[01:21:46] Mike engine I have I have to do I have
[01:21:49] to do the anniversary thing the
[01:21:50] anniversary web
[01:21:52] I have to do it
[01:21:55] also never let guys out did you like it
[01:21:57] did you love it what would you rate it
[01:21:58] you're the best you're the best what
[01:22:00] should I review next so yeah
[01:22:05] I actually did it's actually so detailed
[01:22:06] I'm proud of it I just I yeah all good
[01:22:11] also I forgot how to use a info card
[01:22:13] this thing usually sucks I've never used
[01:22:15] it before look at this now there's a
[01:22:16] thing that shows the artifact talks so
[01:22:18] if you click on it you can see the
[01:22:19] accounts
[01:22:21] please load this is embarrassing oh yeah
[01:22:22] it shows the Galaxy that's cool I only
[01:22:25] added that because I didn't mention how
[01:22:27] good or bad four piece on Adept is I
[01:22:28] just like mentioned her to death so I
[01:22:30] wanted to clarify that so I just put it
[01:22:32] there boom and now it pops up when you
[01:22:33] talk about it I wanted to add that
[01:22:36] and for those wondering it's second best
[01:22:37] but by a extremely small margin so just
[01:22:40] go based on substance go to these two
[01:22:41] bees go whatever
[01:22:43] or go marriage because that's the best
[01:22:48] oh this is a very W crit ratio and
[01:22:50] weapon on your showcase okay do you know
[01:22:52] the [ __ ] up part I know this looks
[01:22:54] insane right this looks insane I know
[01:22:56] this looks insane but two things one I
[01:22:59] lose eight crit damage from not having
[01:23:01] his weapon level 90s level 80 and then
[01:23:03] another eight or something by not being
[01:23:04] fully ascended that's two things on top
[01:23:07] of that uh our subsets aren't even that
[01:23:09] insane most of it like yeah they're good
[01:23:12] but most of it comes from crit Ascension
[01:23:14] 80 crit damage on the weapon and then
[01:23:17] Mario C so like a lot of it is just
[01:23:20] inherently we get a [ __ ] done but part
[01:23:22] of it's come with the weapon too
[01:23:26] actually how good are artifacts maybe
[01:23:28] I'm capping let's see
[01:23:29] maybe they are broken I mean this one's
[01:23:31] pretty good
[01:23:35] dude I'm using this
[01:23:38] this is my circlet
[01:23:40] oh no I changed it that was before no no
[01:23:43] no no wait that was before I changed it
[01:23:44] that's before I remembered what matters
[01:23:46] did I remember I because I I first
[01:23:48] recorded and I was like [ __ ] I'm 120
[01:23:50] criterate and then I changed it so no no
[01:23:52] no it was a bit different it's a bit
[01:23:54] different it's a bit different it's a
[01:23:55] bit different
[01:23:57] yeah like like my sounds like look you
[01:24:00] can be like this is pretty good it's
[01:24:01] what is that like uh 20 I'm tired I just
[01:24:04] woke up but like 25 ish crit value on
[01:24:06] the crit rate plus seven so like 32 3.
[01:24:10] it's like
[01:24:11] what'd I say 332 ish because it's 12.8
[01:24:15] times two but it's like it's okay it's
[01:24:17] it's good
[01:24:20] mod check I'll say that for tonight
