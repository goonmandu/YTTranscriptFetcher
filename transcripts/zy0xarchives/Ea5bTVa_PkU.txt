[00:14:51] today is that why the frame rate is a
[00:14:53] bit
[00:14:55] lower your voice sounds different
[00:14:59] I have a noise suppression on but I
[00:15:01] don't think that's a bad
[00:15:02] thing that's literally the only thing
[00:15:04] that changed I think hey CH he to oh
[00:15:07] maybe my gain's high
[00:15:17] wait
[00:15:21] okay
[00:15:24] uh okay I got
[00:15:27] it
[00:15:30] and streamlabs take a lot of CPU I use
[00:15:32] so I use regular OBS to record but I
[00:15:34] need another program to stream because I
[00:15:36] can't record and stream on the same one
[00:15:37] you be like yeah you can no you can't
[00:15:39] you [ __ ] idiot cuz you can't you you
[00:15:41] can but it records the same thing that
[00:15:42] you stream but I need background footage
[00:15:45] that's different for my stream so I need
[00:15:46] to run two different ones which is the
[00:15:47] only reason why I do that but it is what
[00:15:48] it is maybe one day I could do that with
[00:15:52] just OBS apparently you can if you like
[00:15:55] open it and then like force another one
[00:15:57] to open but that's weird weird so
[00:15:59] anyways um welcome to the stream we have
[00:16:02] a lot to do genin impact
[00:16:04] time uh I hope you're doing well is
[00:16:06] everything okay SC set up is my mic

[00:16:33] pound okay are you pulling for anyia
[00:16:37] constellations is best girl just like is
[00:16:40] best yeah of course yeah yeah I'm going
[00:16:42] to see six her yeah of course of course
[00:16:44] yep of course yep all right let me close
[00:16:48] chat we're going to do this and then
[00:16:49] we're going to G ready ready okay okay
[00:16:52] cream cream okay oh I might have to eat
[00:16:55] I didn't eat all day like at all I've
[00:16:57] just been working on
[00:16:59] video
[00:16:59] so it's basically done but apparently
[00:17:02] there was over 30 minutes so I
[00:17:02] re-recorded parts to make it shorter but
[00:17:05] uh that video is done I I the only thing
[00:17:08] dude I lowkey probably should have just
[00:17:10] done Ryden instead cuz I didn't make a
[00:17:11] Ryden guide yet and I still want to do
[00:17:13] one so it's going to be like a week late
[00:17:15] I don't know if anyone's going to watch
[00:17:16] it anymore but I probably should have
[00:17:17] rushed that one also for everyone asking
[00:17:19] about duuke cuz I've been getting an
[00:17:21] influx of DMS
[00:17:23] listen I literally recorded most of it
[00:17:27] but I've been informed form
[00:17:29] Med that it would be best to wait for
[00:17:32] future characters CH and then we'll see
[00:17:34] what cloud Rainer does before we talk
[00:17:35] about duuke just to wait and see right
[00:17:38] we don't talk about leaks on this
[00:17:39] channel but we might as well wait to see
[00:17:41] because I don't want to make a guide
[00:17:42] after 2 years and then it's instantly
[00:17:44] outdated with that in mind I've noticed
[00:17:46] everyone and their [ __ ] moms have
[00:17:47] been making deluke videos now so now I
[00:17:49] feel late to the party but it is what it
[00:17:50] is it'll be out probably in a month uh
[00:17:54] however I I'm just going to say this
[00:17:56] unrelated to everything else I've said
[00:17:57] before I [ __ ] hate uh uh uh uh the
[00:18:00] build known as Dragon strike just in
[00:18:02] case you're wondering I hate it I think
[00:18:04] it's so [ __ ] cringe and unfun it
[00:18:07] makes me want to commit Minecraft in
[00:18:10] real life I hate it it's so not fun but
[00:18:14] anyways um I wouldn't make a video and
[00:18:17] not talk about it which is why I've been
[00:18:19] delaying it cuz I don't feel like
[00:18:20] talking about it like I recorded the
[00:18:22] rest but I didn't talk about that so or
[00:18:24] like yeah I don't know I I do not want
[00:18:26] to talk about that we'll see though
[00:18:30] um anyways says the Shia main yeah but
[00:18:32] Shia's fun [ __ ] with theuk you have
[00:18:35] to like Dash jump at the perfect time
[00:18:37] you need like diona Shield or an like
[00:18:40] impeccable timing which is weird or like
[00:18:43] there's a lot of different things we'll
[00:18:44] talk about it later it is what it is um
[00:18:47] I don't like it and it's like all that
[00:18:49] it's like so the thing is if you put
[00:18:51] bias it's not cuz it's like incredible
[00:18:54] it takes a lot of mechanical skill which
[00:18:56] is fine cuz I could learn that I I play
[00:18:58] [ __ ] in most games I pick the hardest
[00:19:00] character but it's like you're doing all
[00:19:02] that to deal less damage than a [ __ ]
[00:19:04] Hut it's like you're literally doing all
[00:19:06] of that to be mid at that point play and
[00:19:09] have fun it's like if you're playing
[00:19:10] duuke you're doing it to have fun why
[00:19:12] would you torture yourself why are you
[00:19:13] giving yourself arthritis carpal tunnel
[00:19:15] for literally minimal damage like yeah
[00:19:18] it's a damage increase but we'll see so
[00:19:21] we'll see maybe future characters who
[00:19:22] knows but is what it is skill
[00:19:27] issue
[00:19:29] anyways welcome to the
[00:19:36] stream welcome to the stream I'm going

[00:27:52] not how you spell his name I haven't
[00:27:54] benched Yan or yao yao actually it's
[00:27:57] it's not even why characters I actually
[00:27:58] play most of
[00:28:08] them bro does not look well what the
[00:28:11] [ __ ] does that mean you wouldn't say
[00:28:13] that to my face it's the letter c then I
[00:28:16] [ __ ] play Soo matter of fact okay if
[00:28:19] we're going to talk about CH let's talk
[00:28:20] about CH I am the only player in the
[00:28:22] world right now that's playing sh with
[00:28:25] Soo I've been dude I played it a little
[00:28:27] it's actually fun it's actually it's not
[00:28:30] good okay like I'm not recommending it
[00:28:32] but it's fun it's actually
[00:28:37] fun
[00:28:40] meow okay it's not really fun cuz they
[00:28:43] like they like knock back into Narnia
[00:28:45] but it's it's
[00:28:46] funny
[00:28:48] also I lost Raiden to C4 D this is your
[00:28:52] fault for delaying oh [ __ ] we're
[00:28:53] actually going to have to okay I geared
[00:28:55] all my characters before starting the
[00:28:56] stream so we don't have to do gearing
[00:28:58] right I geared oh chest I geared all my
[00:29:01] characters before starting stream but
[00:29:04] backs you look like a hydro fungi I
[00:29:07] don't look like a hydr
[00:29:09] fungus I literally look I
[00:29:12] literally dude I I I geared everyone the
[00:29:17] only thing I forgot to do is level a
[00:29:19] song of days pass set that's the only
[00:29:20] thing I forgot to do
[00:29:25] um that's the only thing I forgot to do
[00:29:27] so we're going to have to level this on
[00:29:29] stream uh
[00:29:31] yeah but it's fine I might be playing
[00:29:34] DPS chevous cuz I think it's more
[00:29:38] fun but yeah anyways uh my PC is
[00:29:42] overheating let me close a bunch of
[00:29:43] Google Chrome Windows not too many okay
[00:29:46] we're
[00:29:47] good all right let's go so uh sh build
[00:29:51] in case you're wondering sorry no one
[00:29:53] asked literally no one asked also I'm on
[00:29:55] the wrong
[00:29:56] circlet
[00:29:59] dude also I'm going to say something I
[00:30:01] usually contain myself cuz I'm a nice
[00:30:03] person but I'm going to say something
[00:30:04] these [ __ ] mouth breathing saliva
[00:30:07] dripping [ __ ] keep every time I
[00:30:09] show my sh build rank like 30 by the way
[00:30:11] every like oh no er no
[00:30:14] er no er no ER [ __ ] I have C6
[00:30:18] fars on I'm running usually triple Animo
[00:30:21] or a fa character and my sh C6 I don't
[00:30:24] [ __ ] need ER also also
[00:30:29] the only reason I use I have like 50 ER
[00:30:31] pieces and the only reason I use these
[00:30:33] ER pieces that technically are better
[00:30:35] like stat investment wise and an
[00:30:37] Optimizer will tell you it's better just
[00:30:39] because it gives me more ER that I don't
[00:30:40] even need but it looks better and it
[00:30:42] ranks higher so it makes people happy
[00:30:44] but [ __ ] you sorry I'm going to calm
[00:30:46] down um I dropped my
[00:30:50] knife since when do shons give you
[00:30:54] ER okay let's talk let's say you're
[00:30:58] literally the best show in the world
[00:31:00] like me and you're very high investment
[00:31:02] like me you clear enemies in one
[00:31:04] rotation maybe two or you're a failure
[00:31:07] because of this the extra C1 charge is
[00:31:10] actually very valuable for like the
[00:31:11] average low investment I'm trying to
[00:31:13] clear Abyss for the first time take C1
[00:31:16] is not that valuable cuz you need 86
[00:31:18] rotations but if you're one rotating
[00:31:20] everything this gives you a [ __ ] on
[00:31:21] energy also if you press your C6 at any
[00:31:23] point you get infinite energy cuz you
[00:31:25] have infinite ease so when your burst
[00:31:26] ends you [ __ ] plunge your burst
[00:31:28] expires you spam e you get a bunch of
[00:31:29] energy also C2 but this
[00:31:32] sucks okay that's all but C6 farizon
[00:31:35] gives you a lot because of
[00:31:37] this she actually becomes
[00:31:44] good C ease give energy no but if you
[00:31:47] time it right you Plunge at the end of
[00:31:49] your burst which means your burst
[00:31:52] expires but it refreshes the coold Downs
[00:31:53] of your e for you have like 2 seconds of
[00:31:55] you can eam and then or one second and
[00:31:57] then for th for that second all your EAS
[00:31:59] give you energy also I feel like my
[00:32:01] camera's lagging not lagging but it's
[00:32:03] like low frame rate is it maybe I need
[00:32:05] more lighting chat is lighting the

[00:36:36] better
[00:36:41] okay benched video [ __ ]
[00:36:45] you you want to know my take on shers
[00:36:48] whoa she's awesome okay cool uh that's
[00:36:51] not even a take though you'll hear the
[00:36:52] take later okay ready who do we pull for
[00:36:54] I don't want any of these cons Maybe
[00:36:57] I don't know maybe Ryden no probably not
[00:37:01] Ryden awesome m z i completely disagree
[00:37:04] with your take I think she is great for
[00:37:07] like the niche teams she's good in
[00:37:09] meaning Ryan hyper carry and for any
[00:37:11] overload it's cool characters like that
[00:37:13] are good they're good for the game if
[00:37:15] she was straight up better than Kaza all
[00:37:16] the time I think she'd be disgusting as
[00:37:18] a
[00:37:19] fourstar I like
[00:37:25] her like I don't I think she's like I
[00:37:28] don't
[00:37:29] know I think she's good I don't think
[00:37:31] she's
[00:37:33] great I think she's fun actually that's
[00:37:35] not true I do think she can be great
[00:37:37] with C6 but without C6 she's like okay
[00:37:40] that's not even true sometimes without
[00:37:41] C6 she's good I don't even know what I'm
[00:37:43] saying I feel like I'm forced to say
[00:37:44] something that I don't want to say your
[00:37:45] camera is dirty what the [ __ ] no it's
[00:37:47] not wait
[00:37:53] how oh yeah it's [ __ ] lagging wait
[00:37:56] let me ref refresh it why is it not
[00:37:58] focusing the
[00:38:01] hell she as good as yao yao Ya Ya's I
[00:38:04] think ya Yao okay in hindsight I think
[00:38:06] Ya Ya's kind of as a fourstar ya yaa is
[00:38:09] pretty top
[00:38:13] tier like hindsight me thinks Yao yaa is
[00:38:16] even more broken like I really like yao
[00:38:18] yao cuz she enables Quicken teams really
[00:38:20] really well and other teams but
[00:38:22] especially ya
[00:38:25] teams
[00:38:47] okay like so okay okay okay here's my
[00:38:50] before we pull for her because this is
[00:38:52] less likely to get clipped cuz it's
[00:38:53] before we're playing her from my
[00:38:56] knowledge
[00:38:57] sh is good in like any overload team but
[00:38:59] primarily like two or three that we'll
[00:39:01] talk about and in r in hyper carry
[00:39:04] specifically she can be similar in
[00:39:06] strength to Kazo at C6 I don't like
[00:39:08] looking at just numbers though because
[00:39:10] some numbers are like oh slightly better
[00:39:11] but Kazo gives you grouping and stuff
[00:39:13] which is why I don't like saying
[00:39:15] something like that cuz I feel like even
[00:39:17] if it'll math out higher Kazo gives you
[00:39:19] way more utility and overload is
[00:39:22] annoying sometimes but what's cool is
[00:39:26] that
[00:39:27] because she's a viable replacement a lot
[00:39:28] of teams you can free up supports for a
[00:39:30] lot of other teams for example yoia
[00:39:32] overload gets a lot better so if you
[00:39:33] don't want to play Yia Vape or you need
[00:39:34] your SRO on your other team you could do
[00:39:36] that if your Ryden needs like let's say
[00:39:39] you don't want to run Kazu in this team
[00:39:40] can run Kazu in your other team boom you
[00:39:42] can do that also yes it gives you
[00:39:44] resistance Shad very easily even against
[00:39:46] bosses that you otherwise wouldn't be
[00:39:47] able to swirl like for example yeah you
[00:39:50] you can't pyro swirl the hydro tulpa but
[00:39:52] you could do some things like Gua swirl
[00:39:54] Jean Bennett self swirl pyro like
[00:39:56] there's ways to like swirl pyro but you
[00:39:58] can't against those bosses it's easy and
[00:40:00] just in general it's more it's not more
[00:40:01] consistent but it's like very easy to
[00:40:03] set up all you do is you overload boom
[00:40:06] anyways so I actually like her okay not
[00:40:09] dude why does my camera
[00:40:14] keep why does my camera keep on
[00:40:21] focusing wait let me turn autofocus off
[00:40:23] because we just downloaded this I think
[00:40:24] that's why I think autofocus is on let
[00:40:26] me turn autofocus off 10K camera this
[00:40:29] camera is
[00:40:33] $90 I think CLE and Linny are also good
[00:40:37] y sure I mean I would I like fishell
[00:40:39] more than y in a lot of her teams but y
[00:40:41] works I think CLE is a big winner too I
[00:40:42] agree Z Linny is weird cuz I tested it I
[00:40:46] test like I did two Abyss clears with
[00:40:49] Linny and it
[00:40:51] worked but my
[00:40:53] only how do I say this nicely the only
[00:40:56] thing is with me for Linny I'm a spoiled
[00:40:59] kid where I was like why am I not
[00:41:00] playing like Bennett changling or
[00:41:02] Bennett Jong Lee or Bennett kazua so I
[00:41:04] didn't like it as much as the other
[00:41:06] teams but it it was fine because you
[00:41:08] could play
[00:41:09] Linny uh Chev and
[00:41:12] then okay you technically could do
[00:41:14] Bennett but I feel like your pyro app's
[00:41:16] not good enough if you do that so I was
[00:41:18] running DEA which maybe is why I was sad
[00:41:21] that might be why I was sad granted I
[00:41:22] did try Bennett but I only did 121 with
[00:41:25] Bennett
[00:41:27] so de is probably why I'm sad so we
[00:41:29] will'll try that team remind me chat
[00:41:31] we'll try a liny team with Bennett today
[00:41:33] well by today I mean like now like right
[00:41:35] after
[00:41:36] me I just cuz the thing is I feel like
[00:41:39] when I was playing so when I was playing
[00:41:40] fishal Bennett Linny and Sh what's your
[00:41:44] pyro app it's just Linny which means
[00:41:46] sometimes I feel like f might overtake
[00:41:49] it thanks for the year ask to please
[00:41:53] take me to T X3
[00:41:58] I could be wrong Yeah official Shang
[00:42:01] ling a lot we could try that I haven't
[00:42:02] played that team actually I'll write
[00:42:04] that down y official
[00:42:06] shling
[00:42:09] Chev what's ration for C6 gun girl in R
[00:42:12] and Hyper the only okay the way you play
[00:42:14] R and Hyper is you just use your Buffs
[00:42:15] in order to where it's like longest
[00:42:19] duration longest duration second longest
[00:42:22] like shortest and then right in usually
[00:42:24] so like you'd probably do like sof at
[00:42:26] the end sh is before SAR Sher is either
[00:42:29] before or after Bennett it depends how
[00:42:31] much time you have in your rotation in
[00:42:32] my testing I managed to like right in
[00:42:36] get the last slash as Bennetts Buff's
[00:42:38] expiring and I got the sh with Bennetts
[00:42:40] buff in a full damage build but usually
[00:42:41] you're going to play her as a Healer and
[00:42:43] if you do that then you just [ __ ] um
[00:42:46] you just you can use her before Bennett
[00:42:47] you could CH and then Bennett and then
[00:42:49] well you would ride in E sh's burst to
[00:42:52] proc overload then you hold your skill
[00:42:54] cuz you need to fire the overload shot
[00:42:55] then you benett burst then you Sara QE
[00:42:58] or EQ whatever the [ __ ] and then you R
[00:42:59] in Q probably but anyways okay luxurious
[00:43:03] chest and then we pull you see how you
[00:43:05] see how I claimed
[00:43:08] it how much damage is he doing my shab
[00:43:11] was
[00:43:14] doing skill was 60 burst was 75 and then
[00:43:18] a bunch of 10ks like 10 10 10 10 10 10
[00:43:20] 10 it was roughly 200k damage from
[00:43:21] shevar roughly is that better than the
[00:43:23] song of days past and 20% attack
[00:43:26] probably not but you know it's cool that
[00:43:30] was CZ by the way CZ gets a bit more
[00:43:32] damage with with constellations not that
[00:43:34] it's optimal but I think it's viable
[00:43:36] that's
[00:43:43] all okay sorry for stalling Mar dra this
[00:43:46] a prime Let's uh pull who should we pull
[00:43:48] for Chad who should we pull for fast

[00:55:13] appreciate
[00:55:16] it uh I don't know if I want to go
[00:55:18] damage build or healer build yet we'll
[00:55:20] see uh I should
[00:55:24] probably we're going to level okay we
[00:55:26] have our DPS build ready I geared it but
[00:55:28] we let's build a Healer build as well so
[00:55:29] we have both what we're going to do is
[00:55:31] we're going to filter by AG penis and
[00:55:32] we're going to level it oh I have a
[00:55:34] double crit one that's bad for her but I
[00:55:36] kind of want to level it cuz I'm a crit
[00:55:37] addict do I should I seek medical
[00:55:40] attention if I'm addicted to crit value
[00:55:42] [ __ ] it oh no consumables [ __ ]
[00:55:45] it age fear ER okay crit AGP ER crit
[00:55:50] again dude you are [ __ ] me this is
[00:55:53] the wrong set to do this
[00:55:55] this is not the correct
[00:55:57] set bro are you
[00:56:01] kidding I'm trying to build a
[00:56:14] Healer dude I'm trying to heal I'm TR
[00:56:18] just want to
[00:56:23] heal okay bro
[00:56:28] I'm trying to build a Healer
[00:56:31] man what is
[00:56:35] happening okay finally HP I mean she can
[00:56:38] heal this is this is fine right this is
[00:56:41] fine I mean this is a good off
[00:56:45] pie oh it's cuz she's a cop she needs
[00:56:48] damage yeah oh oh of course of course
[00:56:52] okay yeah it's cuz she's American oh oh
[00:56:55] my God it's cuz she's American okay
[00:56:57] makes sense okay we're going to keep it
[00:56:59] we're going to keep
[00:57:00] it
[00:57:10] uh finina off piece uh yeah I mean it
[00:57:15] has attack and HP so it's kind of weird
[00:57:17] but I
[00:57:19] mean okay I mean I actually don't even
[00:57:22] know how to feel about that this one's
[00:57:24] good too I mean it's the exact same
[00:57:26] stats so hopefully we don't get the same
[00:57:27] thing twice in a
[00:57:30] row okay already looking
[00:57:38] better okay already looking
[00:57:42] better uh now that we have our Vermilion
[00:57:45] set solidified solidifi on uh Shia we
[00:57:49] can throw away some lesser used pieces
[00:57:50] that suck this
[00:57:53] one what's our wor
[00:57:55] worst flower here this one no that has a
[00:57:58] lot of attack this might be
[00:58:02] worse you I'm never using
[00:58:07] that o that's a lot of H
[00:58:13] penis oh my oh my oh my maybe this is my
[00:58:17] set what the [ __ ] bro this is my
[00:58:23] set this is actually my set what the
[00:58:37] hell Neu off piece dude stop calling
[00:58:41] every [ __ ] piece an off piece never
[00:58:44] mind okay this is not even this is not
[00:58:45] even a
[00:58:47] piece oh this is so
[00:58:49] good literally no substat other than ER
[00:58:52] matters technically this crit rate could
[00:58:54] be good if we're going fav I don't know
[00:58:56] if we're going fav but just in case
[00:58:58] we're going to level this one because
[00:58:59] it's more
[00:59:01] versatile it's kind of like why I I I I
[00:59:04] I it's like it's like going for ayato
[00:59:06] instead of child because he's versatile
[00:59:08] right okay
[00:59:10] ER although now you just go
[00:59:12] nevet okay crit
[00:59:18] rate
[00:59:23] defense
[00:59:30] wow this is terrible but it's fine I
[00:59:31] mean it's not that bad we're going to
[00:59:32] keep it
[00:59:34] goblet HP with ER that's all we need
[00:59:36] that's all we need oh my HP with ER
[00:59:42] boom crit rate crit rate crit okay em
[00:59:44] it's fine Em's fine
[00:59:50] overload ER nice let me throw a plus 20
[00:59:53] piece cuz we're running out of uh
[00:59:55] artifact XP any need plus 20 Vermillion
[00:59:58] I'm never going to use in my life what
[00:59:59] the [ __ ] is this I'm keeping
[01:00:05] it 10 11 five attack 10 11 no this is
[01:00:11] worse this is 30 crit value I feel bad
[01:00:13] throwing it but there's literally no way
[01:00:14] I'm ever going to use that right or
[01:00:16] should I just keep it for
[01:00:19] fun this is also really
[01:00:22] bad but it's emblem maybe I throw this
[01:00:26] this is so bad
[01:00:37] actually chat which one are we
[01:00:40] throwing Vermilion or
[01:00:43] emblem you can strong box yeah but I
[01:00:45] strong box
[01:00:50] Vermillion both honestly probably both
[01:00:58] fine we'll throw the
[01:01:02] Vermilion oo not bad we don't need ER on
[01:01:05] her so the thing is I don't need ER on
[01:01:07] sh but I don't need any stat on her you
[01:01:09] only care about the [ __ ] main stat it
[01:01:10] doesn't really matter um so the reason
[01:01:13] why I'm looking for ER okay we got em is
[01:01:15] for other characters because I might put
[01:01:17] this on like Bennett actually I'm
[01:01:18] definitely putting this on Bennett or
[01:01:20] something so yeah not even HP well yeah
[01:01:22] but you can't get HP as a subset when
[01:01:24] you have an H main stat like you get
[01:01:25] flat HP but flat HP sucks so like it's
[01:01:28] very minimal is it better than nothing
[01:01:31] sure but it's not worth like Min maxing
[01:01:33] for flat
[01:01:34] HP and at that point you probably want
[01:01:37] er uh on a healing bonus circlet though
[01:01:40] you can get HP per which is oh my God
[01:01:44] which is really good cuz you have ER and
[01:01:45] HP also I just realized I didn't eat all
[01:01:47] day so I should probably start eating
[01:01:49] it's fine we're going to throw this and
[01:01:51] it's going to get only HP and maybe some
[01:01:53] Er
[01:01:57] [ __ ] I mean whatever good enough he said
[01:02:01] that I'm good enough okay uh uh this is
[01:02:03] good we'll just [ __ ] the feather [ __ ]
[01:02:04] the feather [ __ ] the feather we'll go
[01:02:06] like an offset feather with
[01:02:09] hpis sorry
[01:02:13] kakomi
[01:02:16] 43k this is our HP build and we're also
[01:02:18] going to have a damage build read
[01:02:20] passive talent I know if you have 40K HP
[01:02:22] you buff your team but like you're not
[01:02:23] building flat HP for that also 40K HP is
[01:02:26] not like so it's not like it's not easy
[01:02:30] to get but usually you're running black
[01:02:31] tassel or a weapon I like even more
[01:02:34] righteous reward which is a craftable
[01:02:37] Ena zoom and blacksmith that gives you
[01:02:39] like 20 something HP 23 I think and
[01:02:42] energy so well I don't always like it
[01:02:44] more if you're not using your burst go
[01:02:46] black tassel um because you don't need
[01:02:48] to use your burst but
[01:02:51] anyways oh I said Ena zoom in whatever
[01:02:54] [ __ ] Fontan same thing the inauma
[01:02:57] one's not bad either uh K kitten Crosser
[01:02:59] meow if you want your skill to do
[01:03:14] damage
[01:03:16] okay I'm going to predict accurately
[01:03:19] exactly how much HP she's going to heal
[01:03:20] are you ready watch watch watch watch
[01:03:23] watch watch watch watch I'm going to
[01:03:25] show you watch this I'm going to predict
[01:03:28] exactly how much she heals when I played
[01:03:31] her at Talent level E uh Talent level 9
[01:03:35] on my e so I'm doing the mental math
[01:03:37] right now I'm a mental
[01:03:40] gymnast first of all let me put her in
[01:03:43] my
[01:03:47] party where is Chev there she is all
[01:03:52] right team let's move it out
[01:03:58] The Arc of justice is broken okay now
[01:04:03] now let's go here so we can
[01:04:06] heal first chev's death dude we have to
[01:04:09] to heal her it's the fastest way to take
[01:04:15] damage okay so I'm going to guess 43k HP
[01:04:18] T level 9 I'm pretty sure my my HP was
[01:04:20] similar we healed 3771 almost 4K pretty
[01:04:23] good I feel like T level six will
[01:04:25] probably get let's say
[01:04:28] 3500 don't [ __ ] kill me don't you
[01:04:30] dare don't you [ __ ] dare don't you
[01:04:32] [ __ ] dare don't you final
[01:04:36] warning oh 3K only wait why is it so
[01:04:39] much are toal level is that big of a
[01:04:41] deal what the
[01:04:43] [ __ ] oh yeah it actually is pretty big
[01:04:45] anyways we heal 3700 at Town level 9 uh
[01:04:49] but 3K here that's
[01:04:53] Gage
[01:05:00] healing sucks it's cooky ass it's so my
[01:05:03] these are my CS they're going to be in
[01:05:04] my video 3771 is how much I did Talent
[01:05:07] level 9 healing bonus cirit 43k
[01:05:10] HP 3771 which means four procs at a
[01:05:15] decent time and I thought the world four
[01:05:17] procs should get 15K
[01:05:20] healing unless my math is dog [ __ ] but
[01:05:23] that makes sense because it's almost 4K
[01:05:24] and 4 * 4 is 16 um right 13 wait how
[01:05:30] much is it
[01:05:31] 15,000 divided by
[01:05:33] 3771 yeah so four procs and if you do
[01:05:37] get it four procs then that means you
[01:05:38] can get two per rotation cuz well yeah
[01:05:41] cuz she heals six ticks right so you you
[01:05:44] can probably get two I don't really I
[01:05:47] [ __ ] hate this set but I'm pretty
[01:05:48] sure it's the best one on her um or it
[01:05:51] can
[01:05:53] be fighting new synonyms for bad kyes
[01:05:56] dude shut the [ __ ] up it's not great
[01:05:59] healing but it's enough that's what
[01:06:00] matters oh you're running her with
[01:06:02] Bennett anyways so the only reason
[01:06:03] you're maximizing her HP is for two
[01:06:05] reasons one for this passive and then
[01:06:07] two for her healing why do you care
[01:06:08] about healing if you're running Bennett
[01:06:10] you don't but it actually helps with
[01:06:11] song of days past Exile best set no I
[01:06:15] actually don't like that I actually
[01:06:18] really don't like that I've heard people
[01:06:19] talk about Exile sh and honestly I think
[01:06:23] Exile and instructor underrated but for
[01:06:25] her you actually would care more about
[01:06:27] getting the HP that the fourar artifacts
[01:06:29] won't give you and then even if you do
[01:06:30] have 40K HP often times your team won't
[01:06:33] really I mean will they need energy
[01:06:35] Ryden and shenling do if you're playing
[01:06:37] that team sure but like I don't
[01:06:42] know maybe I guess wouldn't milth do
[01:06:46] good on her so here's the thing with
[01:06:47] milth if uh if you're playing if you're
[01:06:50] playing the team if you're if you're
[01:06:52] playing the team that's the Jeff just
[01:06:54] typed in the chat right where you don't
[01:06:55] have Bennett and you can run two
[01:06:56] characters that can snapshot like for
[01:06:58] example Shang Ling fishell you might
[01:07:00] have time to go milth skill swap
[01:07:03] official e swap to shanglin Q snapshot
[01:07:05] the Millet buff on both and then I think
[01:07:07] Millet is actually pretty good but if
[01:07:09] you can't do that then milth isn't as
[01:07:11] good that's basically what it is it's um
[01:07:15] if you can snapshot milth it's good on
[01:07:17] her if not two piece is
[01:07:19] good
[01:07:21] anyways um
[01:07:28] no bless is fine no not good no bless is
[01:07:30] fine but it's the no bless is the only
[01:07:33] reason you use tr's burst if you're not
[01:07:35] DPS which I actually think isn't bad but
[01:07:37] the well copium but we'll talk about
[01:07:39] that I think the only reason you're
[01:07:41] using her burst is if you run a
[01:07:42] blast or you want like you know you have
[01:07:45] downtime in your rotation woo damage woo
[01:07:46] poers
[01:07:51] woo oh yeah you can also for Ren St
[01:07:53] socks that's true if you're playing yeah
[01:07:55] yeah that's also true you could do it
[01:07:57] for ridden teams as well uh that's a
[01:07:59] good that's a good
[01:08:03] point
[01:08:08] um
[01:08:09] however I'll actually make sure to write
[01:08:11] that in my video like just as like text
[01:08:13] let me note that
[01:08:20] down good point chat anyways
[01:08:28] um what was I saying yeah like okay
[01:08:31] let's say you're not going song cuz a
[01:08:32] lot of people aren going to farm this
[01:08:33] and I don't want to like pressure people
[01:08:34] to farm this like if you get it cool but
[01:08:36] as of right now it's like kind of a
[01:08:38] weird Niche set right so it's like if
[01:08:40] you're not farming this you're probably
[01:08:42] going twopiece twopiece or nobless or
[01:08:44] MTH and at that point at that
[01:08:47] point your stats don't matter other than
[01:08:50] like HP and maybe your burst if you want
[01:08:52] to ER if you want to burst or crit if
[01:08:54] you have five but it's like you don't
[01:08:56] need healing at that like you don't need
[01:08:57] to go healing bonus cuz it's like you're
[01:08:59] not really caring about your healing
[01:09:01] unless you're playing
[01:09:04] song
[01:09:06] um
[01:09:10] yeah check genin recommended sets
[01:09:12] they're not out yet it takes time to get
[01:09:14] tabulated I'm pretty
[01:09:16] sure right I'm pretty sure I'm pretty
[01:09:20] sure yeah takes
[01:09:22] time
[01:09:30] will you make a vid on 4.3 artifact
[01:09:31] domain no cuz I didn't really fully I
[01:09:34] didn't have time to it looked bad I
[01:09:35] didn't have I wasn't really I didn't
[01:09:37] really understand song of days pass
[01:09:38] until recently um I think it's still a
[01:09:41] niche set though it might be good with
[01:09:43] future healers not sus by the way but uh
[01:09:46] right now it's mostly like when you it's
[01:09:48] like good for like bendit with finina
[01:09:49] it's good with like in like cringe teams
[01:09:51] I mean I play this team a lot like in my
[01:09:53] shout team I run it on on
[01:09:57] Bennett it's also fine with
[01:10:00] like uh what's her name Chev Chevrolet
[01:10:04] it's probably fine with other ones
[01:10:07] too Barbara yeah I mean Barbara can use
[01:10:14] it where the [ __ ] what am I doing I'm
[01:10:18] just like St okay there they
[01:10:20] are wait no I need Sara oh I leveled
[01:10:22] Sara I didn't level her on my
[01:10:28] account want to see the Chev crit build
[01:10:30] dude you're going to see it soon you're
[01:10:31] going to see it okay I'm not doing a
[01:10:33] full I'm going to do a full clear but

[01:10:36] look so this is czo shers let's look at
[01:10:38] the difference okay day and night surely
[01:10:39] surely surely surely surely surely
[01:10:41] surely surely surely surely surely
[01:10:43] surely surely so e wait what's my
[01:10:45] rotation again it's uh this Pro
[01:10:52] overload torn to Oblivion I didn't
[01:11:05] CR you for it let's light it up going in
[01:11:10] glory to the
[01:11:12] shash now You Shall
[01:11:22] Perish
[01:11:29] hands where I can see
[01:11:32] them that's my captain brother
[01:11:49] toiv okay it's fine it's fine it's fine
[01:11:51] it's fine shut up everyone shut up
[01:11:52] everyone shut up everyone shut up
[01:11:53] everyone shut up okay watch this watch
[01:11:55] this watch this so right in
[01:11:57] E burst boom I'm not even going to bet
[01:12:01] at e it doesn't matter please don't fly
[01:12:03] up cool we okay well we got the fly up
[01:12:05] now You Shall Perish we didn't crit
[01:12:08] again we didn't [ __ ] crit again we
[01:12:10] didn't crit again we didn't crit
[01:12:20] again going please don't fly okay thank
[01:12:22] God we got the easy rotation to it's
[01:12:25] going to crit I I have 70 crit rate it's
[01:12:30] been like [ __ ] three
[01:12:36] bursts I'm not going to skill please
[01:12:39] don't fly this is fine now you shallish
[01:12:43] 4 42 no no no no now I'm not going to
[01:12:47] press any sh's abilities obviously you'd
[01:12:49] use Kazo here so you'd have the the
[01:12:51] electr swur which is similar but uh uh
[01:12:53] uh uh still if I don't use her at
[01:12:56] all I'll use her burst for resolve
[01:12:59] Stacks
[01:13:02] though wait actually that's not true cuz
[01:13:04] we get the overload passive never mind
[01:13:06] you don't need to use your skill to use
[01:13:07] her actually I
[01:13:17] lied didn't crit
[01:13:19] anyways dude I'm convinced my R in is on
[01:13:22] like six crit rate
[01:13:30] you cons I mean that was
[01:13:34] c0 I'm not going to like cause I'm not
[01:13:36] going to do anything stupid uh like I'm
[01:13:38] not going to like benett buff my my
[01:13:40] burst or anything I'm just going to use
[01:13:47] abilities so that
[01:13:49] was I think slightly
[01:13:52] higher
[01:13:55] uh although song of days past gives me
[01:13:57] more attack Buffs after but uh in kazu's
[01:14:00] offense not defense he is on oh it did a
[01:14:03] bit more okay well there you go but in
[01:14:05] kaz's uh in kaz's defense he does more
[01:14:07] damage and he groups you but in kaz's
[01:14:09] offense not defending him this time uh
[01:14:13] you have to understand I'm also on where
[01:14:14] the [ __ ] is
[01:14:16] kazua he's on freedom swen as well so
[01:14:20] wait did I even trigger it
[01:14:22] though
[01:14:25] I don't think I oh yeah I did swirl I
[01:14:26] did swirl yeah I swirl twice
[01:14:31] anyways
[01:14:33] but
[01:14:36] anyways who did better that's not what
[01:14:39] we're looking for the fact that they
[01:14:40] were both viable is all we care about
[01:14:42] because this obviously cazo is a better
[01:14:44] unit but this means you can use shelers
[01:14:46] in those teams and C in another one whoa
[01:14:52] bers
[01:14:55] yeah I think sh made our burst a bit
[01:14:58] higher which is
[01:15:00] cool
[01:15:06] um XD Ryden you're on 70 crit right yeah
[01:15:09] literally
[01:15:13] 69 literally [ __ ] literally brao
[01:15:17] [ __ ] literally I don't think I need
[01:15:20] this much er uh do I have another Circle
[01:15:23] with more CR damage this one but it's
[01:15:24] barely anything no it's not worth it h
[01:15:27] whatever I mean is fine we have a go
[01:15:34] thing okay we're going to do one domain

[01:26:52] going to try to plunge on
[01:26:59] them she seems fun yes I mean that's why
[01:27:02] I talk about the DPS build cuz I think
[01:27:04] it's more like I find it satisfying uh
[01:27:07] and even though it's not like better the
[01:27:09] only time it can be better is in certain
[01:27:11] scenarios where you have time to use it
[01:27:13] in your benit burst like you you don't
[01:27:15] need that much time on your other
[01:27:16] characters and you don't need a lot of
[01:27:18] energy so example Ryden and you're not
[01:27:20] running song of days past if you have
[01:27:21] song of past I don't think it's like

[01:37:22] pointing to due now with their light
[01:37:25] this Claymore wielding badass the very
[01:37:28] first time you meet him and for a good
[01:37:30] reason intelligent experienced albeit a
[01:37:33] little distrusting duuk is incredibly
[01:37:35] powerful taking on the abyss order all
[01:37:37] by himself with his mighty pyro
[01:37:39] abilities guy next patch I promise after
[01:37:42] leing the kns of fonus I promise taste
[01:37:45] as the owner of the Dawn Winery all
[01:37:47] these factors contributed towards him
[01:37:48] ranking high in Google search volume and
[01:37:51] popularity polls across Reddit Hool lab
[01:37:53] and the popular Japanese magazine p but
[01:37:56] he has competition for his brooding
[01:37:58] anti-hero status as his adopted brother
[01:38:00] Kaa also has an equally vocal fan base
[01:38:04] true disagree but your involvement in
[01:38:08] this just made things I feel like
[01:38:09] there's not that many Cay and drers but
[01:38:10] we're very vocal about it n kaching okay
[01:38:13] let go time is honestly Fair we live in
[01:38:16] an era of change as the old order that
[01:38:19] has existed for a thousand years is
[01:38:21] about to be Rewritten the u- hang of the
[01:38:23] leway Ching is a workaholic who also
[01:38:26] might descried as a her tenacious sense
[01:38:28] of responsibility has placed a lot on
[01:38:30] the young woman was this made in 1.3 no
[01:38:32] it's actually not that old it said one
[01:38:35] year ago which is kind of old but okay
[01:38:37] technically 2 years ago okay maybe it as
[01:38:38] old some of her employees to she's also
[01:38:41] a pretty good damage dealer with her
[01:38:43] skills being excellent for mobility and
[01:38:45] action and while exploring but while she
[01:38:47] certainly is an excellent f-star DPS
[01:38:49] Electro character we would be be remiss
[01:38:51] to mention that many users specifically
[01:38:53] describe her cute appearance and cool
[01:38:55] design so you have a visually appealing
[01:38:57] hero that can also do her fair share of
[01:38:59] damage if anything she's a good
[01:39:01] Contender for any team you should both
[01:39:04] be off to the Jade chamber don't this
[01:39:06] was pred dendral so the good Contender
[01:39:08] for any team was cap but late now number
[01:39:11] eight Ryden
[01:39:12] Shogun only through eternity are you how
[01:39:16] the fu is she only
[01:39:17] atpl not to keep pausing the video but R
[01:39:20] into popular she literally transcends
[01:39:23] genin there's literally random weees
[01:39:25] that have her as a background without
[01:39:27] knowing where she's from She's literally
[01:39:28] I've seen her on OSU Maps literally you
[01:39:30] you can't Ryden is like at least top
[01:39:32] three the electro archon Ryden Shogun is
[01:39:35] probably like one at that time don't
[01:39:37] want to trifle with the Undisputed ruler
[01:39:39] of Inazuma displays a cold
[01:39:41] and presenting a wonderfully elegant
[01:39:43] design while she might have started as a
[01:39:45] major antagonist stealing people's
[01:39:47] Powers away she became a welcome
[01:39:49] addition to anyone's fighting roster
[01:39:51] ultimately she fights for her people and
[01:39:53] in the memory of her twin sister across
[01:39:55] multiple polls through the likes of
[01:39:56] Reddit gamewith.net and high Google
[01:39:58] search rankings Ryden Shogun ends up in
[01:40:00] the top 10 throughout this is who's
[01:40:03] above
[01:40:04] Ryden are you eating
[01:40:08] Oblivion number seven G like fluffy
[01:40:12] pancakes really become a safe hard I
[01:40:14] can't even show it bro why can't you see
[01:40:16] this cryo Powerhouse is perhaps one of
[01:40:18] the most powerful DPS characters you can
[01:40:20] have on your Rost
[01:40:21] but that isn't the only reason that this
[01:40:22] queen of ice is popular G also I thought
[01:40:25] would be higher G is very popular as
[01:40:27] well her half in blood she is also an
[01:40:29] adep eye and while she might be
[01:40:31] hardworking her nervousness makes her
[01:40:32] prone to mistakes but all of these
[01:40:34] factors make her an even more adorable
[01:40:36] character whenever you ask players who
[01:40:38] their favorite female character is G is
[01:40:40] bound to pop up having been mentioned
[01:40:42] relentlessly across the countless poles
[01:40:44] we came across despite her quiet and
[01:40:46] reserved nature she has certainly
[01:40:48] impacted fans I thought you hated her
[01:40:50] personality I do oh my God I'm so
[01:40:52] overworked I'm half half yaka aasha
[01:40:57] whatever the [ __ ] half human I don't fit
[01:40:59] in anywhere oh my god oh adeptus that's
[01:41:02] the word not yaka half adeptus oh my God
[01:41:04] oh my God I'm so overworked I make
[01:41:06] mistakes sorry but I like her she's cool
[01:41:08] I mean like visually she's
[01:41:10] [Music]
[01:41:11] cool lauris Skipper okay sorry number
[01:41:15] six V floor skipp or take true to your
[01:41:18] daily to feel like vent is not that
[01:41:19] popular though when you think of An
[01:41:21] Almighty archon that rules over the
[01:41:22] continent the wine loving and
[01:41:24] free-spirited vvti might not be the
[01:41:26] first thing that comes to mind but if
[01:41:27] there was going to be one laid-back
[01:41:29] vessel it makes sense it's the animal
[01:41:31] archon while Pimon might berate him for
[01:41:33] not taking a more active role as a God
[01:41:34] among his people monat's favorite Bard
[01:41:37] is easy to root for from a gameplay
[01:41:39] standpoint he's also an excellent ranged
[01:41:41] character with remarkable abilities that
[01:41:42] help with exploration he's also likely
[01:41:44] to be the first archon vessel The
[01:41:46] Traveler will meet since he's based in
[01:41:47] monat these points likely contribute to
[01:41:50] his high Google search okay who do we
[01:41:52] think's next I think top four h in this
[01:41:54] video
[01:41:55] Hut maybe ya but Y is not above Ryden
[01:41:59] number five kazua okay yeah Fair Kaz
[01:42:07] last upon his announcement some claimed
[01:42:10] that this animal sword wielder brought
[01:42:11] nothing to the table but after he was
[01:42:13] released oh yeah definitely an active
[01:42:15] Contender for people's favorite
[01:42:16] character despite his Heritage he's
[01:42:18] quite an easygoing and gentle soul with
[01:42:20] his own code of conduct his design sees
[01:42:23] him sport cream colored hair and red
[01:42:24] kimona robes he's very effective in
[01:42:27] battle with quick energy recharge and
[01:42:29] excellent crowd control he's been
[01:42:30] described as a more affordable venti if
[01:42:32] there is one wandering Samurai they just
[01:42:34] call Kazo a more affordable ven through
[01:42:36] the
[01:42:38] competition my last line stirs the
[01:42:42] drifter's heart number four jeang Lee
[01:42:46] they say that before he s out he spoke
[01:42:50] the these words when civilization is
[01:42:52] surrounded by chaos and violent beasts
[01:42:54] The Vessel of the gearon stands firm
[01:42:57] jangi is one of the most valuable
[01:42:59] characters in gen an impact to have on
[01:43:00] your team on top of the Geo element
[01:43:02] getting buffed in later updates his
[01:43:04] Elemental Shields are unmatched wait
[01:43:06] what L point of view Gio got buffed yoer
[01:43:10] updates his Elemental Shield impact to
[01:43:12] have on your team on top of the Geo
[01:43:14] element getting buffed l oh GE
[01:43:17] buff I mean the residents got buffed
[01:43:19] that's fair I guess jangi has a VI which
[01:43:23] we won't spoil here peel back his
[01:43:24] steadfast and reserved exterior and you
[01:43:26] find a humble man who seeks peace
[01:43:29] regardless of the reasons jangi is one
[01:43:31] of the most searched on Google of genjin
[01:43:32] impacts characters and effortlessly
[01:43:34] ranks in the top five of many polls
[01:43:36] you'll find around the internet to
[01:43:38] cleanse the land and defend our Safe
[01:43:42] Harbor that was the first contract I

[01:43:50] may not be as as it appears mhm as one
[01:43:52] of the adep and a member of f fact yaka

[01:43:57] your game but when I met Shia for the
[01:43:59] first time lovers oath started playing
[01:44:01] True by the way you can look it up so
[01:44:05] yeah xia is bound by contract to defend

[01:44:15] made it to our top 10 strongest
[01:44:16] characters in genj and impact while he
[01:44:19] might be intimidating audience have
[01:44:20] found peeling back his hermit's reserved
[01:44:22] exterior quite rewarding it's not until
[01:44:24] the player interacts with him that he
[01:44:26] attempts to interact more with Mortals
[01:44:28] so you take a powerful character with a
[01:44:30] cool design and an interesting backstory
[01:44:32] slap on a tremendous English vocal
[01:44:34] performance by Lila bersin and you've

[01:45:01] despite her off thewall demeanor Shia it
[01:45:03] has a different intonation another
[01:45:04] intonation of Shia means short the way
[01:45:06] you say Shia and it's written does not
[01:45:07] actually mean short it's a different
[01:45:08] intonation furthermore if you say Jiao
[01:45:10] that actually means feet it's her work
[01:45:12] with the utmost professionalism people
[01:45:14] seem particularly fond of her design
[01:45:17] sporting long dark hair bright Scarlet
[01:45:19] eyes and funeral parlor outfits on top

[01:45:23] she is a potent pyro user if you want to
[01:45:26] Stack those numbers with a great DPS
[01:45:27] character look no further than the woman
[01:45:29] who makes her living from the death of

[01:50:31] laughing at a new player cuz I don't do
[01:50:32] that but still
[01:50:36] still I mean it is what it is content
[01:50:39] around him is helpful in a fight and has
[01:50:41] become a fan favorite anti-villain it
[01:50:43] makes sense he is currently the most
[01:50:45] popular character in the game unknown
[01:50:48] danger also
[01:50:52] A prime3 Gifted L9 content
[01:50:57] Che free that comes with it to the main

[01:52:11] look I am all for changing your mind
[01:52:14] when new information comes out because a
[01:52:16] lot of times I'll make a mistake or I'll
[01:52:18] be like oh I overlooked something right
[01:52:20] but if you like purposefully clickbait
[01:52:22] something for views and then after
[01:52:24] you're like oh this is clickbait for
[01:52:25] views because of this and then you're
[01:52:26] like oh actually and then whatever the
[01:52:28] [ __ ] that rest whatever the [ __ ] doesn't
[01:52:29] really matter unless it's like unless

[02:08:12] the best judge of other people's sense
[02:08:14] of
[02:08:17] humor
[02:08:19] everybody
[02:08:21] your I shouldn't waste bit up time on
[02:08:23] Shar but I feel like it so we're doing
[02:08:26] it what do this C it's a good Ryden team
[02:08:28] but we're using Soo instead of
[02:08:34] Ryden
[02:08:40] is let's light it
[02:08:46] up dude it's actually fun I'm telling
[02:08:48] you this team is [ __ ] sick it's not
[02:08:50] good like Soo hyper balloon is better
[02:08:53] don't get me wrong but it's fun okay I
[02:08:55] like this team it's funny and that's
[02:08:57] what makes me happy [ __ ] callus it's
[02:09:12] fine no no no no no no no I missed the
[02:09:15] eye I missed the eye I missed the eye
[02:09:23] guil why does Shang Ling have blacked
[02:09:26] hassle wait no
[02:09:37] no that was actually fine though that
[02:09:40] was actually fine though that was still
[02:09:41] a fine run that please please say it
[02:09:44] ain't so oh
[02:09:47] my
[02:09:50] she's supposed to be on hom in this team
[02:09:52] but I give it to my
[02:09:59] chevos it's fine it's okay it's
[02:10:04] fine Shang
[02:10:06] Ling and
[02:10:08] Chevrolet
[02:10:10] okay so the reason why are Bennett of
[02:10:12] times bad is cuz in so in Ryden team you
[02:10:15] can kind of fit shev's Ian burst in
[02:10:17] Bennett's burst if really fast in this
[02:10:20] team you can't so I shouldn't build my
[02:10:22] Chevy for damage in this team and I
[02:10:23] should still instead Go full Healing
[02:10:25] Song of days
[02:10:27] past but I don't care because this is
[02:10:30] more fun so Soo Chevy strangling

[02:30:05] try what if we
[02:30:08] try let me cook really fast what if we
[02:30:11] try Soo but with fishal this time Sino
[02:30:13] fishell Chevrolet benen
[02:30:19] just for one half we won't do the whole
[02:30:20] thing we can play right in after just
[02:30:21] for one half just for one
[02:30:27] half uh I think we do benett first just
[02:30:29] cuz I think sh actually does damage
[02:30:43] here that wasn't too bad though oh also
[02:30:46] official doesn't work against this boss
[02:30:47] I'm pretty sure her A4 is bogged and
[02:30:49] doesn't proc here could be wrong uh in
[02:30:51] which case
[02:31:06] sagge oh we have no pyro application
[02:31:09] okay there's no reason to play ficial
[02:31:10] here what the [ __ ] we could do Shabu
[02:31:13] Shang Ling no Bennett Maybe I'm used to
[02:31:17] it you think it would work with no
[02:31:21] Bennett take
[02:31:28] off no no healer I mean Chevy should be
[02:31:31] on a full healer build in that team yeah
[02:31:33] Shin Ling is going to need a lot of
[02:31:35] VR
[02:31:38] [Applause]
[02:31:42] yeah okay let me save the last clear we
[02:31:45] did no I'll make sure to right don't use
[02:31:47] 123 I'm going to save the clear I'm
[02:31:49] going to title
[02:31:51] it I'm going to title it Soo stream
[02:31:56] clear 121 and 2 okay don't watch pass
[02:32:00] two all
[02:32:02] right play this a Jeff team oh yeah we
[02:32:04] could but the thing with Y is like we're
[02:32:07] going to have to [ __ ] her entire build
[02:32:09] in order to adapt her to this play style
[02:32:10] because usually we go em for hyper Bloom
[02:32:13] granted she will proc overload but
[02:32:16] overload isn't worth really building for
[02:32:20] um but we'll just go attack Sands we'll
[02:32:22] take our sh Sands I
[02:32:25] guess wait never mind I have this one
[02:32:27] just
[02:32:35] chilling I probably want more ER than
[02:32:37] that right does Chevy work with yep what
[02:32:41] does your sh have damage build with HP
[02:32:42] weapon she's on
[02:32:44] Deathmatch hey yeah
[02:32:49] brother hell yeah brother de match
[02:32:52] brother hell
[02:32:56] yeah what set am I running gilded golden
[02:32:59] I don't have a good attack SS on this
[02:33:00] set right actually this is pretty good
[02:33:03] why is on F what the [ __ ] all right time
[02:33:06] to bully F again take that [ __ ] uh we'll
[02:33:09] go a goblet with we'll take the signo
[02:33:10] one with
[02:33:12] ER okay
[02:33:15] better
[02:33:20] how could
[02:33:22] you in this team though an HP build is
[02:33:26] definitely better so we're going to
[02:33:33] go how much H have that's
[02:33:37] nothing I don't want to swap my entire
[02:33:39] [ __ ] build man
[02:33:45] fine
[02:34:00] huh can you hear Fang screaming in the
[02:34:02] background yeah I think she's playing
[02:34:03] lethal Company please uh try your best
[02:34:06] to ignore
[02:34:08] it okay we're
[02:34:11] geared I 10
[02:34:13] months live together no I'm literally
[02:34:16] just temporarily streaming here supposed
[02:34:17] to be for like 2 days but I got stuck
[02:34:19] here cuz I got Co and then we're going
[02:34:21] to the New York concert in like a day so

[02:34:39] Bennett bad boy Shang
[02:34:42] Ling and Chevrolet second half we're

[02:34:48] net
[02:34:52] Bennett okay no Bennett who would be the
[02:34:54] last slot here I think we can do this we
[02:34:56] need a Healer we need a
[02:34:59] Healer maybe

[02:40:49] I really like about chv is she's making
[02:40:51] my AR like 40 team good again cuz I used
[02:40:53] to play duuke fishal overload and I know
[02:40:56] that's not what you want to play but

[03:17:49] you ask for
[03:18:09] it just took 150 minut
[03:18:12] at a roll and cleared floor two of a b w
[03:18:15] in the
[03:18:26] chats trying to figure out what the
[03:18:28] title
[03:18:30] this
[03:18:36] um congrats
[03:18:41] swiggy
[03:18:51] wait
[03:19:11] whatever chatting I'm trying to figure
[03:19:12] out what thumbnail I want to go
[03:19:14] with either I go with they're both bad
[03:19:17] chests so get your bad chest
[03:19:28] ready either we
[03:19:31] do Chevy is awesome bat chess or don't
[03:19:35] build her wrong scholars in the Academia
[03:19:37] are prime
[03:19:40] examples bat chest
[03:19:55] dies of
[03:20:10] cringe
[03:20:25] wait
[03:20:33] um broken she's not
[03:20:39] broken dude don't build Chevy wait do
[03:20:42] you guys don't like her I think she's
[03:20:43] pretty cool I see everything I like
[03:20:50] her I have a pretty positive feelings
[03:20:52] about her
[03:20:56] overall of elimin like not design wise I
[03:20:59] don't care about the design I'm saying
[03:21:00] like like gameplay wise uh pretty
[03:21:02] positive overall to you like everyone no
[03:21:07] I think a lot of characters are mid I
[03:21:09] still make videos on them but I think a
[03:21:10] lot of characters are mid
[03:21:16] I think she's actually pretty good at
[03:21:17] what she does like there's not super
[03:21:19] many teams that want to use her but
[03:21:21] there's quite a bit where she's decent
[03:21:23] like a few where she's decent and then
[03:21:24] at C6 she gets a lot better so I think
[03:21:27] she's all right like I don't think she's
[03:21:28] like you know someone you would
[03:21:30] clickbait but like I think she's
[03:21:37] decent take it
[03:21:40] easy
[03:21:43] we are team in cold
[03:21:53] yeah quietly
[03:21:57] now I mean we've been over this My
[03:21:59] Philosophy is I think every character
[03:22:01] good or bad should have a guide and if
[03:22:02] they're bad I'll just call it like you
[03:22:04] know best build and if they're good then
[03:22:06] I'll be like yo this character is insane
[03:22:08] this character is great or this
[03:22:09] character is whatever right it varies
[03:22:11] like for example cuz I'm honest with
[03:22:13] this stuff I'm honest for example nlet
[03:22:16] is insane true I almost Rod broken but I
[03:22:18] held myself Back official broken build
[03:22:20] true strongest rizzly build strongest
[03:22:22] REM
[03:22:24] build right it's like you
[03:22:27] know great new healer
[03:22:31] true Candace guy okay well I didn't do
[03:22:33] that got a new from an inform looks like
[03:22:37] the situation has changed
[03:22:40] again
[03:22:51] although strongest build I guess I don't
[03:22:52] always do when they're bad like I did
[03:22:53] for Nita cuz I had two Nita videos so I
[03:22:55] guess it depends
[03:22:59] but cuz even bad characters need guides
[03:23:01] and I'm not going to be like this
[03:23:03] character is [ __ ] although I'm honest in
[03:23:04] like the review part if they're not that
[03:23:06] great which I said with Dory I said with
[03:23:09] fem rizley was okay he's not bad
[03:23:13] um I I just think he wants you one but
[03:23:24] anyways got a clickbait for the views I
[03:23:26] don't really think so like I use like
[03:23:28] attractive thumbnails and like if a
[03:23:30] character is broken I'll say they are
[03:23:31] but if they're not I don't need to like
[03:23:33] pretend they are which like I don't need
[03:23:35] to fake it I'll just be like like I call
[03:23:37] it complete guide like nothing in the
[03:23:38] title is like too attractive but then
[03:23:40] the thumbnail just like sells it a bit
[03:23:43] that's
[03:23:44] all that's
[03:23:47] all what does crazy
[03:23:50] mean whoa bad chest crazy means bad
[03:23:54] chest Cole guide um so when Cole first
[03:23:59] came out that was the release of dendro
[03:24:01] 3.0 I made a DMC video instead and a TI
[03:24:04] video I had two videos and then I didn't
[03:24:06] do Cole
[03:24:08] because um at the time she was just seen
[03:24:10] as a worst enro MC now I while that's
[03:24:12] still oftentimes true I understand her
[03:24:15] value in 15sec rotation teams or with
[03:24:17] elegy or if you need front loaded dendro
[03:24:19] with like
[03:24:20] Neu but like for the most part it's
[03:24:22] still kind of but I probably should have
[03:24:25] made
[03:24:30] [Music]
[03:24:35] one Cloud I'm not going to click on a
[03:24:38] link if you type it 20
[03:24:40] times
[03:24:42] I'm not clicking that but if you're
[03:24:44] referencing what I think you're
[03:24:45] referencing yeah I saw
[03:24:48] this wait let me pull it
[03:24:53] up I saw this where is
[03:24:57] it let me open
[03:25:02] [Music]
[03:25:09] it this [ __ ] dude this channel that's
[03:25:12] not even Z Jeffs by the way a fan
[03:25:14] Channel uploaded this with like
[03:25:17] basically the last Del video I did
[03:25:19] titled copy pasted dude I can copyright
[03:25:22] strike this what the [ __ ] that's weird I
[03:25:25] mean it's fine I don't care cuz it's Z
[03:25:27] but it's weird it's not even a it's
[03:25:29] literally just talking while killing the
[03:25:30] Vish
[03:25:32] app which is you know I love ad streams
[03:25:36] I'm sure it's good content I'll watch it
[03:25:37] later but I'm just saying it's literally
[03:25:40] cofy based
[03:25:42] it's not a Jeff no well I don't think so
[03:25:44] it's uh
[03:25:45] unofficial
[03:25:49] see have you ever pets they're very
[03:25:53] [Music]
[03:26:07] cute at least he made one true we will
[03:26:10] make one the thing is I don't
[03:26:14] like
[03:26:16] um how do I say this I don't like that I
[03:26:20] with duuke I have to I've been having to
[03:26:22] wait for a new character like eight
[03:26:23] times I should have just made eight
[03:26:25] different videos like a normal YouTuber
[03:26:26] and just kept on milking it so that's
[03:26:28] probably what I should do I honestly
[03:26:30] don't even want to wait for 4.4
[03:26:31] genuinely cuz I don't feel like it but I
[03:26:33] I will I just don't dude it's like I had
[03:26:35] to wait for Nikita another I forget who
[03:26:38] was after her that I wanted to wait for
[03:26:40] and then finina and then then I just
[03:26:42] excuses and now [ __ ]
[03:26:44] 4.4 what new character I mean we have to
[03:26:46] see we don't
[03:26:53] know Shang artifacts
[03:26:56] sure nothing too crazy on our strangling
[03:26:59] well it's pretty good but it's just
[03:27:02] emblem this is usually em though
[03:27:05] actually no ER is good sometimes we're
[03:27:07] usually on the catch though but now I'm
[03:27:09] on homo no I'm on Deathmatch the
[03:27:19] [ __ ] is here and
[03:27:31] now but yeah anyways with that in mind

[04:18:58] you guys with a very entertaining video
[04:19:00] to watch okay I'm gonna go on
[04:19:03] YouTube I'm going to search Zio
[04:19:11] clip and I'm going to click whatever the
[04:19:13] first result
[04:19:16] is okay it's
[04:19:18] this this was the first result why is
[04:19:21] there a CO
[04:19:30] warning Z Clips covid warning bro
[04:19:35] what
[04:19:38] what if they watch this clip of me
[04:19:39] watching the clip that they clipped of
[04:19:41] my stream dude okay Allan my guide
[04:19:44] editor who also makes shorts he was
[04:19:45] asking me if it was unethical if for our
[04:19:49] Tik Tok we took clips from clip
[04:19:51] compilations of me and I wasn't sure I
[04:19:53] was like they're my clips and I streamed
[04:19:55] them but if they're from a clip
[04:19:57] compilation is it our content like yes
[04:20:00] but is it weird if they T like I was
[04:20:02] actually like I didn't know the answer
[04:20:03] is it am I allowed to take clips from a
[04:20:05] clip channnel me and then like subtitle
[04:20:08] it and edit it for a Tik Tok or a
[04:20:10] YouTube short I mean I guess so cuz it's
[04:20:11] my content but what if it's like what if
[04:20:14] it's like like some dude impact I think
[04:20:16] shout out he made like a z clips of
[04:20:18] sumaru patch and then it's like old ass
[04:20:19] clips that's hard to find without it so
[04:20:21] I mean I guess it's still my content but
[04:20:24] it's like a very
[04:20:26] useful maybe I'll just like PayPal them
[04:20:28] if I use them I'll let Allan use them I
[04:20:30] mean it did is my content but if Allan
[04:20:31] uses them and they pop off I'll be like
[04:20:33] yo what's your PayPal I don't know ises
[04:20:36] that guy still exist shout out impax if
[04:20:38] he still
[04:20:41] exists I think
[04:20:43] so you ask for permission okay but the
[04:20:45] problem is it's
[04:20:47] like I can't ask for permission for my
[04:20:50] content like I know I'm allowed to use
[04:20:52] it I'm just like I'm wondering what the
[04:20:55] morality behind taking it from a clip
[04:20:58] channel is I don't know it's not me like
[04:21:00] my editor like I'm not like watching
[04:21:02] them but it's like I don't
[04:21:05] know
[04:21:14] just tell them
[04:21:17] yeah but also I wouldn't really know cuz
[04:21:20] it's not like I'm watching them it's
[04:21:22] just but yeah
[04:21:27] anyways yeah if it's like a that's what
[04:21:29] I was thinking too if it's like an
[04:21:30] edited video like the the one suyo
[04:21:33] does um who by the way made a video for
[04:21:36] me too for the second Channel and I
[04:21:39] haven't uploaded them yet but they're
[04:21:40] bangers I promise so stay tuned for
[04:21:42] those they're actually bangers but like
[04:21:44] this guy actually makes like well
[04:21:47] there's a few Clippers like this but
[04:21:49] like these are like actually like edited
[04:21:51] like if I turned this into like my own
[04:21:53] video then yeah it's still my content
[04:21:55] but it's very like transformative to
[04:21:56] where I'd feel bad but if it's just like
[04:21:58] a okay wait what is this oh my God it's
[04:22:00] the thirst
[04:22:05] trap yeah like this is very clearly like
[04:22:08] a work of art whereas if it's just like
[04:22:10] Clips in a row I don't think it's a big
[04:22:18] deal okay we're not watching
[04:22:21] this okay anyways I'm going to beb I
[04:22:23] have to
[04:22:24] pee I made that yeah it's actually yeah
[04:22:27] I mean yeah
[04:22:32] yeah don't fall in I can show you guys
[04:22:34] the video he sent me but okay let me be

[04:24:34] literally like the one with the
[04:24:35] subscribers it literally took like 6
[04:24:37] hours EV last 40 days listen here if
[04:24:39] you're a master procrastinator like me
[04:24:41] 40 means two and two means one why is my
[04:24:43] trending President Biden and then Moira
[04:24:46] and then cave we're not going to talk
[04:24:47] about it we're going to farm resent
[04:24:48] we're going to do the new event or the
[04:24:49] not even new anymore but the one with
[04:24:52] Che I'm going to record the show guide
[04:24:55] tomorrow you might be like how do you
[04:24:56] know sus well there's a trial of her so
[04:24:58] we know what she does she's basically
[04:25:00] Neu but for overload [ __ ] the burst and
[04:25:02] build her dpse e so she's basically the
[04:25:05] ne of overload now overload is kind of a
[04:25:07] do sh reaction but what's cool a lot of
[04:25:09] electron power characters are pretty
[04:25:10] good so like Ryden benett changling
[04:25:12] that's already overloading by accident
[04:25:14] uh yoia bishell B Shang C6 is
[04:25:17] [ __ ] 60% power damage and Electro
[04:25:20] damage bonus for my understanding this
[04:25:21] is all from your skill so I don't know
[04:25:23] what the point of her burst is that's
[04:25:24] what the point of the Mask is like why
[04:25:26] do you even press Q on her damage w wow
[04:25:30] I can't wait to deal damage on my knee
[04:25:32] loose wait am I wait am I missing
[04:25:34] something wait your damage skills on
[04:25:35] attack but you're healing and your buff
[04:25:36] is HP okay yeah why would you even wait
[04:25:40] it's not a de moment cuz she's like Neu
[04:25:41] like she'll just buff your damage
[04:25:42] regardless so who cares about her Dam oh
[04:25:44] if you're C6 you heal though a lot maybe
[04:25:46] at C6 you want
[04:25:48] HP I don't know if you're playing

[04:41:35] it at some point I just don't remember

[04:41:44] she found karbala should I read this I
[04:41:46] didn't finish her story Quest though
[04:41:48] like her I did the archon I didn't
[04:41:49] finish her story
[04:41:51] one finina once found a relatively
[04:41:54] unknown book in the library of Fontaine
[04:41:57] and the story's main character was a
[04:41:58] servant working in an opulent
[04:42:03] Mansion wait uh your in my playlist I'm
[04:42:06] skipping the song
[04:42:09] though the idealistic young mmal
[04:42:12] following by a newspaper advertisement
[04:42:14] came to a remote manner in the mountains
[04:42:16] to apply for employment and despite her
[04:42:18] clumsiness became a maid there all the
[04:42:21] same the master of the Mansion did not
[04:42:23] appear often and though his
[04:42:25] loqu superintendent and etiquette minded
[04:42:29] janum managed in in his absence she led
[04:42:32] a Carefree life there none of the men
[04:42:34] attendance had been to the city in quite
[04:42:36] a long while and so the maid taught them
[04:42:39] to sing the latest songs play the latest
[04:42:41] tabletop games and thus the servants
[04:42:43] grew closer and closer and enjoyed ones
[04:42:45] and one another's company this there was
[04:42:48] one there was but one Ironclad rule
[04:42:51] which was that none should approach the
[04:42:52] heavy wooden door that led three floors
[04:42:55] underground behind which was locked a
[04:42:57] secret that only the master of the
[04:42:59] Mansion was privy to though the maid was
[04:43:02] curious she measured her vibrant life
[04:43:04] there too much to pry time passed
[04:43:06] quietly and one day there were told they
[04:43:08] were told by the jeam that the master
[04:43:10] was about to visit so the servants
[04:43:12] hurriedly began to prepare the banquet
[04:43:16] was akin to a festival and laughter and
[04:43:18] cheer filled every corner of the Mansion
[04:43:20] at least until the master was late the
[04:43:22] second day and upon investigating the
[04:43:25] maid was to discover his already cold
[04:43:30] corpse
[04:43:31] wow the guards narrow down the suspects
[04:43:34] the servants but the maid convinced that
[04:43:35] the Master's death has something to do
[04:43:36] the Mansion Secret at least decided to
[04:43:38] open the Forbidden gate to her surprise
[04:43:39] what awaited her on the other side was
[04:43:40] the mansion's main hall upon the central
[04:43:43] stairs of which stood the all too
[04:43:45] familiar Su of the house the words she
[04:43:47] spoke to were bizard known to the maid
[04:43:50] ah you must be the newest applicant
[04:43:52] cabaletta I believe finina was
[04:43:54] dumbfounded when she read that for the
[04:43:56] story that recalled similar events in
[04:43:58] her memories she admitted that the happy
[04:44:01] lives of the maid and she she admired
[04:44:03] the happy lives of the maid and the
[04:44:04] other and the maid's courage in facing
[04:44:05] down the ancient secret to defend that
[04:44:07] later life to defend that life later
[04:44:09] finina dreamt of that same mansion in
[04:44:11] Her Dream she was cabaletta huffing and
[04:44:14] puffing as she ran down to that door of
[04:44:16] Secrets and with one deep breath pushed
[04:44:17] it open behind it was a torrent of
[04:44:19] seawat that drowned the mansion in an
[04:44:21] instant dissolving all of its weake the
[04:44:23] guards the superintendent the je and
[04:44:24] even herself funa woke with a start
[04:44:26] looking around her to gather her wits
[04:44:29] and the rest of her story sprang to mind
[04:44:31] unbidden crab Aletta made use of the
[04:44:33] time Loop triggered by opening the door
[04:44:36] to solve the mystery of the Master's
[04:44:37] death and discover the Mansion secret
[04:44:39] freeing all its inhabitants from an
[04:44:41] ancient curse thank you crab Aletta she
[04:44:44] thanked the brave staled girl for giving
[04:44:47] that tale a happy ending and as for
[04:44:50] several Vivid F figures from the story
[04:44:53] they would eventually be given lovely
