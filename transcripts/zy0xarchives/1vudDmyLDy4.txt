[00:30:05] Showcase a bit more realistic obviously
[00:30:07] my sh is like insane so it is high
[00:30:09] investment but I will explain more on
[00:30:10] that in the Showcase section now

[00:36:43] commemorate the legendary lock Knights
[00:36:46] who went on a quest to search for uh the
[00:36:49] holiday but what's with that weird
[00:36:51] expression on your face it's like you're
[00:36:53] trying really hard to remember
[00:36:55] something
[00:36:57] ah I was just trying to recall the exact
[00:37:00] description from the books in order to
[00:37:02] avoid any uh unnecessary arguments over
[00:37:06] well either way P thinks she gets it now
[00:37:08] it's just like the yes those are F to
[00:37:11] commemorate the lock kns people but a
[00:37:13] few years ago that really does the whole
[00:37:16] thing oh that sounds pretty ah yes it
[00:37:19] appears the falia film festival is an
[00:37:21] event proposed by the Fontaine film
[00:37:23] Association this year now that film Tech
[00:37:26] ology during this time people may submit
[00:37:29] films to be evaluated and the finina
[00:37:32] award what
[00:37:34] award the finina award wait that's kind
[00:37:37] of sick I want that Aran they coined it
[00:37:40] while lady finina was still in power but
[00:37:43] uh even though things have changed
[00:37:45] perhaps everyone still thinks of it as a
[00:37:47] pretty appropriate name even though she
[00:37:49] isn't the high spoilers ARA is still
[00:37:53] what
[00:37:54] the what the [ __ ] event SPO
[00:37:57] pretty well when you put it that
[00:37:58] way oh but who would have guessed there'
[00:38:01] be an issue with the
[00:38:04] funding oh my God chori oh my God how to
[00:38:09] describe her remarkable design anyway CH
[00:38:12] I feel yo is this toxic I don't know if
[00:38:14] this is toxic she gives me my she gives
[00:38:17] me like standard Banner geoc character
[00:38:20] Vibe cast for the film but I don't know
[00:38:22] if this is like a kind soul who are the
[00:38:25] actors from inuma do we know them not in
[00:38:28] a mean way I'm just saying like we

[00:38:40] is beautiful and she's standard Banner

[00:38:47] going to get a new standard maybe I mean
[00:38:50] yeah we didn't get one for inauma so I

[00:53:43] if you do why are you on
[00:53:52] emblem c0 yeah c0 doesn't go CZ goes to
[00:53:57] emblem I mean I guess you're just
[00:53:59] stacking ER like I might as well deal
[00:54:01] damage sure I guess see one to five on
[00:54:03] emblem no it's still vescent but you
[00:54:05] filter you filter so unless you're
[00:54:07] playing okay if you're playing Shia
[00:54:09] farzon and then finina you want

[00:54:14] farzon and then like let's say Jong
[00:54:17] Lee then okay you might not need
[00:54:19] vescent and benett but then it's like

[01:11:19] would literally do crab I would do crab
[01:11:22] Roots every day for adep is Temptation
[01:11:25] is dude actually but now adeptus it's
[01:11:28] not even the best food cuz you you you
[01:11:30] want the [ __ ] the the the the the
[01:11:31] where is it the this one the [ __ ]
[01:11:33] pile them ups but you need this
[01:11:35] one and the the chii food too they give
[01:11:37] 20 crit damage 20 crit rate so it's good
[01:11:40] for like bad
[01:11:45] chesting anyways say one story dude I
[01:11:49] got a I got a [ __ ] birthday mail from
[01:11:52] Dory
[01:11:54] dude why is she sending me mail who gave
[01:11:57] you my number Dory who gave you my
[01:12:03] number wait that's actually crazy the
[01:12:05] two family members I have that are genin
[01:12:07] characters are literally back toback
[01:12:10] birthdays that's crazy someone someone
[01:12:13] there knows me someone there has my
[01:12:17] docks delete
[01:12:22] her
[01:12:27] they don't know you okay we'll see we'll
[01:12:31] see cuz who was the one asking for Abyss
[01:12:34] cooldown resets for years everyone not
[01:12:37] just me I know but I was Community whoa
[01:12:40] whoa what the [ __ ] I just opened a
[01:12:42] tab I thought I could do a survey how do
[01:12:44] I do a survey oh is there a survey [ __ ]
[01:12:47] never mind wait what if I check my mail
[01:12:52] again never never mind
[01:12:57] delete is the new Claymore good you mean
[01:13:00] the freet to play one or the verdict if
[01:13:01] you mean the freet to play one well
[01:13:02] they're both pretty good but verdict uh
[01:13:03] the free to play one this one is
[01:13:05] actually so many stats dude if it's R5
[01:13:07] this should be 24 plus 2 that's 48
[01:13:09] attack with a high base attack and a
[01:13:10] bunch of ER so for any Claymore that
[01:13:12] wants even a bit of ER is really good
[01:13:13] cuz you can use the ER and then a lot of
[01:13:20] attack at Z recommended strong box for
[01:13:24] anari why would you add me for
[01:13:26] that seek Jesus why did I say that I'm
[01:13:29] sorry uh uh I mean wanders is pretty
[01:13:33] good but you don't need to strong box
[01:13:34] wanders cuz you get it from boxes uh not
[01:13:36] boxes bosses so if you play that like I
[01:13:38] don't know if you're like new you
[01:13:40] probably don't have good wanders but
[01:13:41] like as you ascend a bunch of characters
[01:13:43] you might get a wander set if not you
[01:13:44] could do deepwood and golden troop no I
[01:13:47] said build the troop again you could do
[01:13:49] deep with and gilded dreams and then you
[01:13:51] might get uh gilded uh uh uh which is
[01:13:54] like a cool thing to just get while
[01:13:55] you're farming your D stuff or you can
[01:13:57] do twopiece twopiece but most people go
[01:13:59] wanders I feel like wanders is pretty
[01:14:01] good it's pretty easy to get you could
[01:14:02] also strong box like if you have like a
[01:14:03] few pieces you can also strong box
[01:14:10] it golden troop what is it called it's
[01:14:12] golden troop gilded dreams gilded dreams
[01:14:16] golden troop Guild the dreams golden
[01:14:18] troop I got
[01:14:20] it well how do I get this should get
[01:14:22] this way point let get this
[01:14:26] point what Geo character should I use
[01:14:28] with Navia if I don't have jeang le
[01:14:30] albo sorry uh you could sorry you could
[01:14:33] use uh
[01:14:35] technically okay technically you could
[01:14:37] Noel finina or you could GI MC
[01:14:40] personally I un I I genuinely believe
[01:14:43] it's better or technically ning Wong but
[01:14:45] I believe it's better to just not have
[01:14:47] another Geo at that point you could go
[01:14:49] MC you could ning Wong with like
[01:14:51] thrilling tales and then walk through
[01:14:52] her Jade thing and then you get buffed
[01:14:54] or not use throwing tails and use it sub
[01:14:55] DPS but I feel like it's just better to
[01:14:58] solo Gio and just play a high energy
[01:15:00] team like fishal or some
[01:15:10] [ __ ] like I would I don't know
[01:15:12] personally I'd rather have a ficial in
[01:15:13] my team than a
[01:15:14] GC Goro unironically dude but the thing
[01:15:17] with Goro the thing hydr sorry this 18
[01:15:20] months shout out the thing with Goro
[01:15:23] dude here's what I okay okay okay he's
[01:15:25] fine but it's just dude it's like all
[01:15:27] the stats you're getting are wasted you
[01:15:28] get literally you don't even get [ __ ]
[01:15:31] crunch you don't get the Geo damage
[01:15:32] bonus you just get defense and and and
[01:15:34] and resistance Interruption wow impregn
[01:15:37] impregnable wow and then conations C6
[01:15:40] you get a bit of crit damage to your Geo
[01:15:41] damage but it's 20% unless you're triple
[01:15:44] Geo but you're not going to be triple
[01:15:45] Geo so it's literally 20% crit damage
[01:15:46] which is okay CR damage is okay but like
[01:15:49] I'd rather have a
[01:15:51] FAL just like cuz FAL also is is like a
[01:15:53] battery she's just
[01:15:56] like why you guys typing huh it
[01:15:58] literally said
[01:16:00] that so do a third Geo [ __ ] they
[01:16:04] said they don't have albo or Jong Lee do
[01:16:06] you want them to play not what do you
[01:16:07] want them to do do you want their team
[01:16:08] to suck unless you're doing Noel Goro
[01:16:11] Navia finina but outside of that what
[01:16:13] you're going to do two bad Geo
[01:16:14] characters to funnel one good
[01:16:20] character hey there hey there

[01:44:28] KES
[01:44:32] boom let's make 30 sucros I want to see

[01:44:40] zros this is why you're better than Kwa
[01:44:42] uh we're going to go weapons boom no
[01:44:44] wrong character who's a catalyst boom
[01:44:46] boom nope wrong
[01:44:49] weapon
[01:44:56] nice well I can Auto out 40 at a time
[01:44:59] now right maybe I should just Auto at
[01:45:01] it's I don't
[01:45:07] know obious C1 more or less value than
[01:45:09] verdict C1 is just ER help uh mostly C2
[01:45:13] is the nice one so I don't really I'm
[01:45:14] not a big honestly I'm not that big of a
[01:45:16] fan of either I just think verdict is a
[01:45:17] nice axe verdict is better if you don't
[01:45:19] play Bennett or if you don't have a good
[01:45:21] like a good weapon already like serpent
[01:45:22] spine serpent spine is so good if you
[01:45:24] have serpent spine you're
[01:45:25] chilling but it's an axe so I want it
[01:45:27] like there's no reason for me to also
[01:45:29] level 90 woo uh C's a bait C2 is fine
[01:45:33] it's not bad like it's not like I don't
[01:45:35] know it's just crit
[01:45:37] rate that's nice it's I actually think
[01:45:40] it's pretty nice I don't think it's as
[01:45:41] good as a lot of characters c2s but it's
[01:45:43] pretty
[01:45:46] nice also some Stacks but yeah um
[01:45:53] dude dude dude dude what is it called
[01:45:54] what it called I think dude dude dude
[01:45:55] dude dude I listen I have no reason to
[01:45:57] get verdict but it's an axe but who
[01:46:00] would I use it on cuz I'm probably the
[01:46:03] only thing is if I get it then my
[01:46:05] serpent spinosi which is currently on
[01:46:07] BET no it's on Navia but usually it's on
[01:46:09] BET this means I could keep verdict I
[01:46:12] could keep serpent spy on BET and
[01:46:14] verdict on
[01:46:19] Navia I could also use it on duuke but
[01:46:22] the thing with duuke
[01:46:26] is I
[01:46:31] could it's way too cool yeah it's
[01:46:34] literally my favorite weapon okay the
[01:46:35] problem is chat no leaks no leaks but
[01:46:40] the problem is whatever Cloud retainer
[01:46:42] weapon is I'm probably going to get it
[01:46:43] no leaks I'm just saying whatever it is
[01:46:46] I'm probably gonna get it I'm just
[01:46:47] saying cuz I like her and her
[01:46:49] personality I'm just saying and I can't
[01:46:51] be pulling on every web man because then
[01:46:53] I become a whale so I kind of want to
[01:46:55] save but it is an axe so I'm conflicted
[01:46:58] I don't know I don't
[01:47:09] know just [ __ ] get
[01:47:19] it is there someone else who oh oh Mama
[01:47:24] Mia I might also get arinos cuz if she
[01:47:26] comes out I don't [ __ ] know but look
[01:47:28] at her
[01:47:29] chat [ __ ] but I I whatever I I probably
[01:47:33] have a good weapon for whatever weapon
[01:47:34] she is probably like whatever it is she
[01:47:38] looks okay I probably shouldn't talk
[01:47:40] about this cuz you guys are like but
[01:47:42] like I don't even like I visually she
[01:47:44] looks like she'd use not a claymore or a
[01:47:46] catalyst one of the other three probably
[01:47:48] not a bow either so a sword or pole arm
[01:47:50] probably
[01:47:50] and I have good both of
[01:48:07] them verdict is sexy it is dude it's so
[01:48:12] cool I've been saying I want a like
[01:48:15] scythes and axes so like I think I
[01:48:19] should
[01:48:28] chat chat we do the strong Box video
[01:48:32] versus slice right and if I lose I pull
[01:48:35] on the weapon better till I get it win
[01:48:38] win I'm probably going to lose anyways
[01:48:40] you guys have seen my
[01:48:45] luck can you please watch this if you
[01:48:48] don't watch it I will deep throw your

[01:48:54] full YouTube video for 100
[01:49:00] bits all right so we what the [ __ ] is
[01:49:04] this what the [ __ ] is this middle
[01:49:06] parting right here how do we get rid of
[01:49:08] it the first reason why you probably
[01:49:11] have a m middle or Center parting is
[01:49:13] just because of your hair being very
[01:49:16] long and the natural weight of your hair
[01:49:18] wants to just simply your hair dude

[02:53:43] wither
[02:53:44] and I occasionally catch a scent of
[02:53:47] loneliness I once again am thinking back
[02:53:49] to the research in my childhood together
[02:53:52] with you in no man's land that comfy
[02:53:54] cabin teaming with boundlessly joyous
[02:53:57] forms of life those days are
[02:54:02] Unforgettable I understood the fastness
[02:54:05] of the universe too early I was
[02:54:08] different than every other
[02:54:12] kid okay thank got
[02:54:18] this all
[02:54:20] [Music]
[02:54:21] again W birth growth
[02:54:37] death lamenting the process of life is
[02:54:40] the origin of my
[02:54:43] thinking
[02:54:45] sorry I began to realize that I longed
[02:54:48] for something
[02:54:49] pure attachment involves the insular
[02:54:53] cortex okay first of all move these
[02:54:56] subtitles bro bro okayy and
[02:55:01] pain the laws of emotion can be easily
[02:55:04] broken down children will become more
[02:55:07] well behaved when they receive random
[02:55:10] rewards when I discovered how easy it
[02:55:13] was to cultivate a plan minute I began
[02:55:15] to feel empty the [ __ ] was
[02:55:18] that I increasingly understand that I
[02:55:21] long for more fundamental
[02:55:24] research recently I've had some
[02:55:26] different thoughts why made such a
[02:55:29] headache at first I was terrified of its
[02:55:33] appearance it is born of Wonder does not
[02:55:35] resist and does not grieve it is the
[02:55:37] closest thing to the feeling I had when
[02:55:39] I was a child not carrying one at
[02:55:43] all
[02:55:45] it asked me where does the research
[02:55:49] end life is so colorful but it has
[02:55:53] nothing to do with me you
[02:55:55] my I explore the mysteries of the
[02:55:57] universe and seek deeper
[02:56:01] answers I have nothing to lose and
[02:56:04] nothing to
[02:56:07] gain if life is cultivated and
[02:56:12] reproduced you can dissect remembrance
[02:56:15] control equilibrium deconstruct Beauty
[02:56:17] and reproduce
[02:56:20] permanence I will understand life and
[02:56:22] touch on these
[02:56:23] [Music]
[02:56:25] conceptions and perhaps I too can become
[02:56:30] an what become yo yo yo you got

[02:59:40] listen to like his theme I listen to the
[02:59:41] character themes a lot but a lot of
[02:59:42] times when I play genin I have music
[02:59:44] down because I it's like it's
[02:59:45] inconsistent sometimes it's really loud
[02:59:47] it's not really loud that's
[02:59:48] [Music]
[03:00:02] why
[03:00:04] who no I don't want to watch this again

[03:00:42] though
[03:00:46] I
[03:00:49] mean thanks by okay bye thing I'm Pro
[03:00:56] no I'm Pro characters dying like I think
[03:00:58] characters should honestly more
[03:00:59] characters should die in genin but here
[03:01:01] it wouldn't make sense for him to die
[03:01:03] cuz his his [ __ ] dad's the Geo archon
[03:01:05] bro like he's not L you wouldn't make
[03:01:10] sense but I like characters that have
[03:01:13] like a good art where they die and it's
[03:01:14] like it means something like no spoilers
[03:01:17] but like the arc like the 4.2 Quest I
[03:01:19] think the characters that did die it was
[03:01:21] like okay like I'm sad they died but
[03:01:23] it's like okay that's kind of like it
[03:01:25] feels like it was for
[03:01:30] something which is why oh his name which
[03:01:33] is why people are like oh like like
[03:01:34] anytime I joke about child dying like I
[03:01:36] hope child dies child's not going to die
[03:01:38] this joke is getting old it's like bro
[03:01:40] shut the [ __ ] up it's okay if a villain
[03:01:43] Di in like a good way if Shia dies to
[03:01:46] save like the [ __ ] save genin impact
[03:01:49] I'll be happy I love Shia I don't want
[03:01:50] him to die but it'd be cool if it was
[03:01:52] like
[03:01:55] meaningful
[03:02:01] sorry oh this Rex Cano yeah I know the
[03:02:03] song okay well I'm I'm definitely going

[03:17:19] bro burst it after benett burst again
[03:17:21] yes you don't understand you literally
[03:17:24] you are so listen you are so you are you
[03:17:27] are the Jeff pill right now you are so
[03:17:29] in your in your one rotation mindset
[03:17:31] that you don't even understand what I'm
[03:17:32] doing I'm doing it to get more sacks on
[03:17:34] finina so when I press e One Shot St and
[03:17:36] it does more damage I am stalling as
[03:17:38] much as I can swapping into Navia so
[03:17:40] that when I do my golden troop is is
[03:17:42] still active and finina gives me as many
[03:17:44] Buffs as possible which which you cannot
[03:17:46] even fathom you cannot even
[03:17:49] fathom you cannot even fathom you cannot
[03:17:52] even fathom that's why e on Bennett it's
[03:17:54] not for the particles it's for the
[03:17:56] additional time of healing this com at

[03:18:04] it I don't have enough Stacks never mind
[03:18:06] I
[03:18:10] do can't even work properly is there in
[03:18:13] a mode for you yapping okay you're doing
[03:18:16] one rotation yeah but you always do one
[03:18:17] rotation with like domain for Navia and
[03:18:19] in Abyss you do when you're a true Navia
[03:18:21] main true Navia Mains are like dude
[03:18:23] Navia if you invest into it literally
[03:18:24] clears in either one and a half or two
[03:18:26] and a half rotations cuz you [ __ ] one
[03:18:28] shots everything and you can extend your
[03:18:29] rotations so let's say a normal
[03:18:30] character would need one or two you can
[03:18:32] do. five which basically gives you a
[03:18:34] whole new rotation in like 2 seconds
[03:18:36] because you just wait for one more e to
[03:18:37] extend your combo it's a big five we
[03:18:41] have pop Nemo and have

[04:27:50] have to connect them like I don't know
[04:27:52] what I'm trying to
[04:27:53] do I assume they have to connect to
[04:28:04] here
[04:28:08] but like what the [ __ ] is
[04:28:11] this what if I put one here what
[04:28:14] happens okay what if I put one
[04:28:34] here
[04:28:40] wait does this thing have anything to do
[04:28:41] with this puzzle like do I have to do do
[04:28:43] these [ __ ] main things matter oh my
[04:28:57] [ __ ] what if I put one here this
[04:28:59] looks like a good spot I lost it it's
[04:29:00] not in my [ __ ] inventory
[04:29:03] anymore in the AR terms of an
[04:29:11] Angel chat I hate inauma okay puzzles
[04:29:14] and listen call it a skill issue I don't
[04:29:17] care sumaru exploration it's like it's
[04:29:19] like it's like it's like it's like it's
[04:29:21] smooth like butter like a criminal
[04:29:24] undercover boring Fontan graceful
[04:29:29] elegant no no here is where I think
[04:29:32] right but why is it oh I can just
[04:29:34] connect it with myself wait true I go in
[04:29:37] the middle and then they stay in the
[04:29:39] middle wait I'm
[04:29:41] cooking this one I don't think goes here
[04:29:43] but I'm just going to put it here for
[04:29:43] now I need a third one right I need a
[04:29:45] third one where's the third one it's
[04:29:51] down some was worse than Inazuma yeah
[04:29:54] you're [ __ ] yeah nice try yeah that's
[04:30:04] bait
[04:30:31] uh I am directionally challenged by the
[04:30:33] way I know you guys can tell but like
[04:30:35] this this is just my life okay I like
[04:30:37] I'm good at most things but directions
[04:30:40] don't ask me for
[04:30:48] them bro where the oh
[04:30:53] here you're giving me a
[04:31:00] headache uh this one should probably
[04:31:03] be I'm actually not sure I'm going to be
[04:31:05] real I'm going to put it here I'm just
[04:31:08] going to leave it here for now I don't
[04:31:09] know how I'm supposed to connect this
[04:31:10] one wait let me see
[04:31:17] something wait let me try something over
[04:31:19] here
[04:31:20] actually does this do
[04:31:22] anything what the [ __ ] bro [ __ ] you
[04:31:26] relay Stone come
[04:31:34] here
[04:31:48] okay this thing does not go backwards it
[04:31:49] literally
[04:31:50] doesn't it it can't it literally can
[04:31:52] only go there unless it's just stupid
[04:31:55] maybe it's just
[04:32:04] stupid
[04:32:12] okay I need to somehow get that
[04:32:19] there wait but then e stop
[04:32:30] shooting why does it choose a
[04:32:34] favorite
[04:32:47] oh wait but how do I connect can I
[04:32:49] connect these two or did they just not
[04:32:51] connect wait I can what if I do
[04:32:55] this I hate you know Zumo I if I could
[04:32:59] nuke if I could nuke this island I
[04:33:02] wouldn't but I would consider it
[04:33:07] so I assume I have to be Electro in the
[04:33:10] middle and connect all of them I just
[04:33:11] don't know where to place the relay
[04:33:12] Stones that's it like I get that I have
[04:33:14] to be the connector I get that I get
[04:33:16] that I have to connect all the like
[04:33:17] pillars but I don't know where the
[04:33:20] stones have to be that's the only
[04:33:33] thing I got
[04:33:39] Fon wait I have one already right here I
[04:33:43] forgot wait let me make sure this
[04:33:47] works okay yeah I definitely have to do
[04:33:51] that on I don't know why I did that I'm
[04:33:57] waiting
[04:33:58] [Music]
[04:34:03] yeah okay
[04:34:06] took so long it became a new day I will
[04:34:09] literally I
[04:34:10] will don't test me do I need another
[04:34:13] relay Stone what is this please I'm I'm
[04:34:17] I'm losing it right now I'm about to
[04:34:19] lose it right now I'm about to lose
[04:34:24] it okay let me make sure my theory works
[04:34:27] but that's just a
[04:34:30] theory okay wait a second that's one
[04:34:34] wait wait wait
[04:34:36] so that's done all I need to do is
[04:34:37] connect that one so which of these
[04:34:39] Stones is
[04:34:40] wasted
[04:34:42] um one of these is too many unless
[04:34:45] there's an extra relay Stone there might
[04:34:47] be is if there's another relay Stone I'm
[04:34:49] going to pee in a
[04:34:52] mug I'm just going to assume there's not
[04:34:55] cuz I don't want to do
[04:35:02] that Chad do I sound like Kirby be
[04:35:04] honest what hey okay that was kind of
[04:35:06] bad let me do it
[04:35:08] again that was Yoshi not bad though
[04:35:11] actually not bad actually not bad like
[04:35:12] like five out of 10 6 out of 10 6 out of
[04:35:26] 10 yeah yeah I'm done I'm done the
[04:35:28] puzzle yeah of course I would have still
[04:35:30] be at the same puzzle
[04:35:34] right
[04:35:46] oh wait what what the [ __ ] did I just
[04:35:48] connect to why I just connected to
[04:35:50] something H what the [ __ ] is
[04:35:53] that you [ __ ] why did it respawn oh my
[04:35:57] God they
[04:36:01] despawn yeah yeah let's just put a
[04:36:03] despawn timer on them yeah yeah why not
[04:36:05] why
[04:36:14] not they expire with
[04:36:34] range
[04:36:36] bro does that
[04:36:40] connect wait that
[04:37:00] works bro what the [ __ ] you are useless
[04:37:05] you are useless nobody loves you sorry
[04:37:07] sorry but you are sorry but you are
[04:37:10] sorry this thing is
[04:37:15] useless let me just test some things
[04:37:21] out bro is talking to a stone
[04:37:25] dude I don't know how to I'm I assume I
[04:37:28] need to like float like in the middle
[04:37:29] and then it like connects a bunch but I
[04:37:31] don't know how the flip wait can I
[04:37:33] connect this thing
[04:37:36] but but
[04:37:38] but what if I put a stone
[04:37:45] here [ __ ] I missed people wonder why the
[04:37:48] devs keep the game casual you are the
[04:37:50] prime specimen they use as an example oh
[04:37:53] yeah exploration is really hardcore
[04:37:55] content oh yeah when I ask for endgame I
[04:37:58] want a puzzle to explore woohoo yep also
[04:38:03] dude sumu and font 10 puzzles are
[04:38:05] actually way better who are you dude who
[04:38:07] do you think you are
[04:38:09] sorry maybe I'm just a toddler with no
[04:38:29] hands I lowkey forget what relay Stones
[04:38:31] do though I can't lie well I mean now I
[04:38:33] can tell what they do wait okay so okay
[04:38:36] okay I'm going to assume I have to
[04:38:37] connect this and
[04:38:40] that to
[04:38:42] that which
[04:38:44] means I probably make a triangle which
[04:38:47] means I probably
[04:38:49] do can I put the one like there let me
[04:39:03] see I just don't know which way the like
[04:39:05] what is a [ __ ] what shoots and what
[04:39:08] takes the electricity that cuz that
[04:39:09] thing goes
[04:39:11] up how the [ __ ] do I connect this
[04:39:14] one no that's not right never mind let
[04:39:17] me take it back I should probably put
[04:39:19] wander in my team
[04:39:27] huh uh fin you're a little benched I'm
[04:39:32] sorry what do you want
[04:39:37] okay I don't need this thing
[04:39:44] here wait let me
[04:39:49] think wait okay they all need to go
[04:39:51] there see this new cool video that was
[04:39:53] just up hours ago wait wait wait if they
[04:39:57] all go there and this thing I can't move
[04:39:59] that means that that has to go to the
[04:40:01] middle and then the middle has to go to
[04:40:02] there which means there has to be one in
[04:40:04] the middle and then has to be one this
[04:40:05] has to connect to either that or that
[04:40:08] I'm not sure probably that which
[04:40:11] means wait let me see something let me
[04:40:13] try something let me try something I
[04:40:14] just want to see something I just want
[04:40:15] to see something
[04:40:20] Fury
[04:40:26] huh but like this doesn't shoot anywhere
[04:40:29] so how the
[04:40:33] [ __ ] maybe it needs an another Stone and
[04:40:35] then I go okay let me keep let me keep
[04:40:37] cooking is this Ina Zuma no this just
[04:40:39] came out this is Fontan
[04:40:45] 2 The Wind
[04:40:48] Rises if the solution is way easier than
[04:40:51] I think it is I am I am going to lament
[04:40:54] very loudly because I assume I need
[04:40:56] everything to
[04:40:58] thing press G and look at
[04:41:01] functions
[04:41:03] functions
[04:41:07] puzzle it's l not what is that called
[04:41:09] what are those even called wait let me
[04:41:10] go to inuma one
[04:41:15] sec let's [ __ ] font bro wait where's
[04:41:20] inuma sumaru
[04:41:27] sumaru there's literally none about the
[04:41:29] oh actually there wait there might be oh
[04:41:31] there it is yeah but I know that
[04:41:40] I know
[04:41:53] that okay let me try
[04:41:59] something
[04:42:02] behold okay I connected two now I just
[04:42:04] need to connect
[04:42:06] three how do I do that I don't know one
[04:42:10] stone two Stone where's the third one I
[04:42:12] supposed to have one more where's the
[04:42:13] third one I'm supposed to have one more
[04:42:15] where's the third one I'm supposed to
[04:42:16] have one more where's the third one I'm
[04:42:17] supposed to have one more where's the
[04:42:18] third one I'm supposed to have one more
[04:42:20] where's the third one I that one more
[04:42:22] where's the third one I that one more
[04:42:23] Stones one more time and then maybe you
[04:42:25] look at them again you're the third no
[04:42:28] I'm the [ __ ] fourth there's three
[04:42:30] there's literally
[04:42:32] three I got it
[04:42:35] I got
[04:42:37] it
[04:42:40] wah also listen if you beat this in like
[04:42:44] four minutes that's cuz first of all
[04:42:46] congratulations second of all it's cuz
[04:42:47] you were Ena Zuma in the mindset I just
[04:42:49] came back I don't remember what anything
[04:42:50] does that's number one number two if you
[04:42:51] looked up a guide for this you cannot k
[04:42:54] w or type you can't cuz I did it I am
[04:42:56] being a trooper right now okay anyways
[04:42:59] how the [ __ ] do I I have to
[04:43:01] climb Wind Rises it just came out true
[04:43:07] quit following me quit following
[04:43:14] me you're a mental Titan
[04:43:18] true uh so this one I'm going to put
[04:43:21] this I think that one so I'm going to be
[04:43:23] the middle connector I don't know this
[04:43:27] thing only this thing only this thing's
[04:43:29] a bottom it's it's literally not
[04:43:30] shooting it just
[04:43:33] [ __ ]
[04:43:35] it just [ __ ] sits
[04:43:38] there wait wait let brother
[04:43:43] cook I think one of my Stones is
[04:43:46] misplaced but I'm cooking a
[04:43:47] little like I feel like I'm cooking a
[04:43:49] little cuz if what if I go here and then
[04:43:51] I connect all of them no okay this is I
[04:43:54] [ __ ] up but I I get the idea I get the
[04:43:57] idea so like I have to be here this is
[04:44:00] ugly maybe that one's wrong maybe both
[04:44:03] of them are wrong actually
[04:44:17] swen
[04:44:29] Fury
[04:44:33] no
[04:44:35] this [ __ ] stopped
[04:44:50] working oh wait maybe I don't need this
[04:44:54] to
[04:44:55] wait okay wait I just need to know what
[04:44:57] happens if I do this I just want to
[04:45:00] see that did nothing never
[04:45:03] mind
[04:45:09] Pythagorean theorem that's to calculate
[04:45:12] the [ __ ] E news bro chill wait so
[04:45:14] this wait wait wait I actually figured
[04:45:16] out I actually cooked I actually cooked
[04:45:18] I actually cooked I actually cooked wait
[04:45:19] wait wait wait wait
[04:45:32] wait so I'm going to going to make this
[04:45:35] connect to something and this connect to
[04:45:37] something and then both of them are
[04:45:38] going to shoot there so [ __ ] this thing
[04:45:40] this thing I don't need to cuz this
[04:45:42] thing is useless I think I could be
[04:45:44] wrong
[04:45:49] but no no no no wait I actually cooked I
[04:45:52] actually cooked I actually cooked I
[04:45:53] actually
[04:45:54] cooked wait no this thing also has to
[04:45:56] connect there wait I need something here
[04:45:58] I this thing needs to go there but it
[04:46:01] also needs to go there how the [ __ ] do I
[04:46:03] line them up
[04:46:19] I just want to test something another
[04:46:21] test
[04:46:25] subject dude this electr grum kind of
[04:46:27] looks like
[04:46:32] Vermilion I just want to see what
[04:46:33] happens
[04:46:46] huh what if I do like
[04:46:49] this no it doesn't that doesn't shoot
[04:46:52] that's bad I just want
[04:47:03] to
[04:47:16] like what's the range on this one oh
[04:47:18] that actually
[04:47:33] worked
[04:47:35] oh my
[04:47:42] God I just understood what you have to
[04:47:44] do oh my God why did I look at
[04:47:47] it bro this thing you okay this thing
[04:47:51] has three things which means you have to
[04:47:53] connect all three bro I didn't look at
[04:47:55] it okay I didn't look at it I thought
[04:47:57] you just have to connect the big
[04:48:01] things okay it's actually obvious this
[04:48:03] is actually so obvious how did I not
[04:48:05] just look at it but also what I didn't
[04:48:07] know what to look at man I didn't know
[04:48:09] what to look at how the [ __ ] would I
[04:48:10] know but I was awesome I should have
[04:48:12] just looked at it uh I still have to
[04:48:14] figure out what to do but at least I
[04:48:16] know what to do like I know like roughly
[04:48:18] what to do but bro [ __ ] me
[04:48:23] man okay so I need to send all three of
[04:48:25] them to that I didn't know I thought I
[04:48:28] had to send them all to that thing no
[04:48:30] wonder it made no sense all these words
[04:48:33] they make no sense
[04:48:34] sense BT never mind I don't want to
[04:48:37] think right now [ __ ] you I lost my relay
[04:48:40] Stones didn't
[04:48:42] I can't wait to go back and get more
[04:48:46] Stones wait I did
[04:49:02] it
[04:49:17] how many days in genin has it been since
[04:49:19] you started this puzzle I've never done
[04:49:21] this puzzle Wind
[04:49:24] Rises doesn't work in Co-op
[04:49:27] oh wait wait but okay where are my
[04:49:29] stones again oh I [ __ ] placed one
[04:49:31] here I
[04:49:32] forgot okay let me okay these are
[04:49:34] [ __ ] disgusting
[04:49:36] wait so if I'm okay let's say let's say
[04:49:40] does this thing see
[04:49:43] me [ __ ] you okay let's
[04:49:47] say I need to put three things there
[04:49:49] right which means this thing needs to
[04:49:51] shoot there and this thing needs to
[04:49:52] shoot there so this thing this thing
[04:49:54] what if I put it like what if I put it
[04:49:55] like what if I put it like I'm going to
[04:49:57] assume they don't need you to Glide
[04:49:58] which means I could this will probably
[04:50:00] work surely
[04:50:02] right never mind
[04:50:26] wait wait
[04:50:29] wait okay this is actually stupid
[04:50:31] there's no way this goes here there's
[04:50:32] actually no way
[04:50:34] I'm like certain something needs to be
[04:50:36] here though I'm like 99% sure or this
[04:50:39] might be Me Maybe I stand here but I'm
[04:50:41] like 99% sure cuz it's faster to
[04:50:43] diagonal them like it's easier to
[04:50:45] [ __ ] like connect them like like that
[04:50:47] which means I probably have to put

[05:22:39] I can't reuse them I was telling him I
[05:22:41] want to have an artifact set on each

[05:22:46] more like have to spend way more resin
[05:22:48] for it so I I actually kind of agree cuz
[05:22:50] the end result would be the same so I
