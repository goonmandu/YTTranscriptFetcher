[00:06:49] regardless of your time zone what what
[00:06:51] if like the dev streams and the patches
[00:06:53] both came out at the same time so that
[00:06:54] if it's your full-time job to do both
[00:06:57] you wake up at the same time

[00:32:52] is why we have chosen this moment to
[00:32:54] convene the war dance it is also for
[00:32:57] this reason that the title of Sword

[00:40:15] swords he collects them like they're
[00:40:17] going out of fashion then never uses

[00:40:22] the most damage but that's okay he's
[00:40:25] trying you guys don't share everything

[00:40:36] he's already stronger than anything out
[00:40:39] there weapons of this caliber usually
[00:40:41] get their own
[00:40:43] name what do you call them not bad
[00:40:45] feathers finally someone who understands

[00:40:52] ages old metal old metal it's it has a
[00:40:58] ring about it I like it too me and old
[00:41:02] metal have a deep connection every time
[00:41:04] I get into a scrap I ask old metal which
[00:41:07] one do you want to strike old metal
[00:41:10] usually says something like let's start

[00:41:20] right old Metal's adorable manner belies
[00:41:23] his formidable stature you might Young
[00:41:27] she's confident and unafraid to speak
[00:41:29] her mind it's time we took a look at her
[00:41:31] skills sure let me lock in as a physical
[00:41:34] type character following the path of
[00:41:37] Destruction gentle persuasion isn't
[00:41:40] really my style when using my skill I
[00:41:43] restore my own HP while dealing physical
[00:41:46] damage to a single Target and adjacent
[00:41:49] enemies classic set you Le a part in
[00:41:52] combat is the way she counters the enemy
[00:41:54] when attacked she immediately launches a
[00:41:56] counter on the attacker dealing damage
[00:41:58] to the Target and adjacent enemies Bears
[00:42:01] a grudge and knows friend from foe she
[00:42:04] doesn't mess around you got wait am I
[00:42:06] going to get her before I get CL after
[00:42:09] using my ultimate I acquire the Perry
[00:42:12] state which allows me to sustain lower
[00:42:14] damage and taunt all enemies in addition
[00:42:17] my ordinary counter is upgraded to
[00:42:20] powerful counter which deals higher
[00:42:23] damage you seem well versed in the art
[00:42:26] of wait too one assumes that surprise
[00:42:29] attacks during exploration aren't a
[00:42:31] concern for I wanted japar to release of
[00:42:33] venturine before I got him I wanted CL a
[00:42:36] special effect for a set duration if an
[00:42:38] enemy launches an attack during that dur
[00:42:41] the attack is blocked and upon entering
[00:42:43] battle I launch a powerful counter on a
[00:42:46] random enemy imagine you've hardly
[00:42:48] regained your footing when a girl with a
[00:42:50] giant blade comes running straight for

[00:45:44] I spend so much time delving into the
[00:45:47] spicy miracles of medicinal Cuisine a
[00:45:50] meal is not simply a merry occasion but
[00:45:52] an opportunity for food to work this the
[00:45:56] oh [ __ ] system okay my bad isn't that
[00:46:00] beautiful why baller dividing the pot
[00:46:02] into nine sections if you're going to
[00:46:04] eat from all of them sorry no silver
[00:46:06] wolf slander she's good sorry I'm a
[00:46:08] self-confessed Chow Hound she's
[00:46:10] definitely better than pil I eat and
[00:46:13] then I leave oh you ain't going anywhere
[00:46:15] yet doctor delicacy is aside let's talk
[00:46:18] some more about that healing of yours
[00:46:21] before you came under General faa's
[00:46:23] command you were well known in this yino
[00:46:25] ya chink's out
[00:46:27] commission you went on to cut your teeth
[00:46:29] as a military healer with the cloud
[00:46:31] nights on campaigns for the hunt I heard
[00:46:35] you decided to retire only returning to
[00:46:38] service at the personal request of The
[00:46:40] Cauldron Master H Some people prefer
[00:46:43] work to Leisure I suppose well I am
[00:46:46] fortunate enough to be respected for my
[00:46:49] craft some even go so far this guy keeps
[00:46:51] calling himself a Healer but is he even
[00:46:53] a Healer as general faia strategist show
[00:46:57] applies his taste for spice to
[00:46:59] Battlefield tactics combat is a bubbling
[00:47:02] broth with each side occupying
[00:47:06] One Hot Pot indeed battles are marked by
[00:47:10] Myriad changes constantly evolving in a
[00:47:14] we're about to see I guess and
[00:47:16] young well said General they say foxes
[00:47:19] are cunning creatures seems like Mr J
[00:47:21] what if for every debuff he heals you I
[00:47:24] think it's time we took a look at what
[00:47:25] our delicious doctor can do on the
[00:47:27] battlefield show me well about time I am
[00:47:31] a fire type character on the path of nil
[00:47:34] when using my technique during
[00:47:35] exploration I create a special Dimension
[00:47:38] after entering battle with an enemy
[00:47:40] within the dimension I inflict them with
[00:47:42] fire damage and there's a possibility of
[00:47:44] following up with a stack of Ashen roast
[00:47:47] debuffs okay we're cooking the enemy
[00:47:52] alive Ashen Rose turns up the heat by
[00:47:55] causing enemies to sustain greater
[00:47:57] damage any attack that jao lands on an
[00:48:00] enemy has a chance of inflicting Asen
[00:48:02] roast indeed take more damage chasing
[00:48:04] point if I were to use my skill to deal
[00:48:07] blast damage there would be a chance of
[00:48:09] simultaneously inflicting a stack of
[00:48:11] Ashen roast on the target did you just
[00:48:15] throw spices into the battlefield sharp
[00:48:18] eyes General after launching My ultimate
[00:48:20] the battlefield becomes an enormous
[00:48:22] yyang Hot Pot the enemies are trapped in
[00:48:26] a serious broth which inflicts damage on
[00:48:29] each and every one of them at the same
[00:48:32] time the effects of Ash and roast are
[00:48:34] compounded for enemies inflicted with
[00:48:36] the debuff in line with the current
[00:48:38] highest number of stacks immediately
[00:48:41] after a field appears which lasts for a
[00:48:43] set number of turns all these hot pop
[00:48:47] visuals are making me hungry again okay
[00:48:51] I mean my brain is thinking acaron
[00:48:53] enemies within the field sustain greater
[00:48:55] ultimate damage okay and during their
[00:48:58] action there's a chance they will be
[00:48:59] inflicted by a stack of Ashen R okay
[00:49:02] this guy just printed foron for example
[00:49:05] acaron were on the team you would be
[00:49:07] able to help her acquire ultimate
[00:49:09] Char absolutely right nice of you to
[00:49:13] invite the enemy to dinner before
[00:49:15] showing them the door the last
[00:49:19] experience where hello Mr military
[00:49:21] healer where was the military
[00:49:23] healing well we've got to know new
[00:49:26] friends from both the zooming and the

[00:51:15] called March 8 or like April
[00:51:18] 7 on returning to the sieno March 7th
[00:51:22] brimming with excitement for the
[00:51:24] upcoming War dance and as SI to learn
[00:51:26] Sword Play from Masters Yun Le and Yan
[00:51:30] Ching I still vividly remember hting
[00:51:33] yanqing in the way of the sword now he's
[00:51:36] already passing on his knowledge to
[00:51:40] others how time flies March s might be a
[00:51:43] rookie but also a natural did he say Yan
[00:51:47] Ching taught her oh she's cooked taught
[00:51:49] her the best in juming Sword Play so
[00:51:52] naturally she's made quick
[00:51:54] progress y is also March 7th's Master F
[00:51:59] to deprive and inquiring mind of tuition
[00:52:01] is not in his nature all right you are
[00:52:05] General I heard that March 7th was a bow
[00:52:07] and arrow user Brave of her to take up
[00:52:10] the sword and no doubt a challenge for
[00:52:13] her Masters I'll say not to mention
[00:52:16] yunle and yening sore play isn't exactly
[00:52:19] similar well March 7th end up with a
[00:52:21] weird mix of
[00:52:23] styles you're overthinking things if
[00:52:26] you're dedicated to the sword you just
[00:52:28] need to swing it ah Follow The Sword and
[00:52:32] victory will
[00:52:34] follow well we've done a lot of talking
[00:52:37] time to see March 7th sword plan action
[00:52:39] March 7th the hunt basic attack deals
[00:52:42] imaginary damage when using her skill
[00:52:46] March 7th selects a teammate to master
[00:52:48] wait itally with a special to increase
[00:52:51] their
[00:52:52] speeded good Apprentice as a promising
[00:52:55] young student March 7th has a keen
[00:52:58] understanding of her master style when
[00:53:00] her master launches an attack or
[00:53:02] ultimate March 7th acquires charges when
[00:53:05] charges reach a set number of stacks she
[00:53:08] immediately takes action again and
[00:53:10] obtains an enhanced basic
[00:53:12] attack basic attack deal set hits of
[00:53:14] damage to a Target enemy with a Chance
[00:53:17] of dealing further hits just a
[00:53:21] chance she's a rookie remember her moves
[00:53:25] might be a little rusty but they can
[00:53:27] surprise you all the same depending on
[00:53:30] her master's path her specific attacks
[00:53:32] possess additional effects that's right
[00:53:36] for example Masters on the PA of
[00:53:38] Destruction IR addition or the hunt can
[00:53:41] cause specific attacks to deal
[00:53:43] additional damage and Masters on the
[00:53:46] pass of nihility Harmony preservation or
[00:53:49] abundance can raise the toughness
[00:53:51] reduction of specific attacks putting
[00:53:53] learning into practice
[00:53:56] where do I find an apprentice after
[00:53:59] using her ultimate March 7th can deal
[00:54:01] damage to a Target enemy while improving
[00:54:03] her next what the [ __ ] is that and for
[00:54:07] those who were wondering what having
[00:54:09] marchas an apprentice is like there you
[00:54:12] have it March 7th is humble and learns
[00:54:14] from all her allies during exploration
[00:54:17] for every time a teammate uses their
[00:54:19] technique March 7th acquires a charge at
[00:54:21] the start of the next battle when using
[00:54:24] her own technique she regenerates enery
[00:54:26] at the start of the next battle it must
[00:54:28] be a great privilege to have an
[00:54:30] apprentice with such powers of
[00:54:32] perception that's cool well get this
[00:54:35] completing specific tasks in the version
[00:54:36] 2.4s trailblaze continuance will unlock
[00:54:39] March 7th the hunt once unlocked a path
[00:54:42] switching option will appear in the
[00:54:44] character interface for this yep that's
[00:54:47] my Apprentice she certainly does have
[00:54:49] the or yeah she has to be I think we
[00:54:52] could all lie down more exciting update

[00:55:27] no I'm
[00:55:32] not wait so is that guy just Pila too
[00:55:35] but an ALT buffer primarily I heard
[00:55:38] vulnerability debuff and ALT like
[00:55:41] increased Al like alt vulnerability or
[00:55:43] some [ __ ] I don't know I don't remember
[00:55:44] exactly what they said but like one that
[00:55:46] increases damage and one that increases
[00:55:48] alt damage and
[00:55:50] debuffs we'll see I will say though cuz
[00:55:53] I was kind of joking but there's new
[00:55:54] Chatters so you could tell if I was
[00:55:55] joking
[00:55:57] uh silver wolf is good but PE is [ __ ]
[00:55:59] broken so yeah like actually broken like
[00:56:03] best nil well suppen to it's time we

[00:56:12] as the war dance approaches guests and
[00:56:14] visitors from all Corners are converging
[00:56:16] on the lau but not all are harboring
[00:56:19] Noble
[00:56:21] intentions I'm sure all you remember a c
[00:56:24] IPC representative by the name of Scott
[00:56:27] oh the
[00:56:29] alliance the conduct and deeds of the
[00:56:31] IPC hardly
[00:56:33] surprising well Scott is out to
[00:56:36] demonstrate that Ceno Sword Play is no
[00:56:39] match for R PC Tex o not only does he
[00:56:42] have a Mech related provocation in store
[00:56:45] but also wants to assert his authority
[00:56:47] through battle for real I think me and
[00:56:49] old metal owe this guy a beating or 10
[00:56:53] hold your horses Miss unun Le as a
[00:56:56] matter of fact your Apprentice got a
[00:56:59] little impulsive and took up the
[00:57:01] challenge she's due to face off against
[00:57:04] her opponent in just 15 days time A
[00:57:07] Familiar turn of events are we able to
[00:57:11] assist Miss March in this endeavor of
[00:57:13] course to help Marsh defeat this IPC
[00:57:16] rotten egg Dr bers will take up the
[00:57:19] position of personal trainer the goal
[00:57:22] develop a 15-day crash course in Sword
[00:57:25] Play H 15 days crash course what the
[00:57:29] [ __ ] do you know about have you heard
[00:57:31] the proverb haste makes waste have you
[00:57:35] heard the proverb when needs must
[00:57:38] between me and Yan heard the every has
[00:57:42] an end except bananas which have two
[00:57:45] still training also requires rest
[00:57:49] relaxation and fun the fabled work life
[00:57:54] balance s like you've got to figure it
[00:57:57] out
[00:57:57] missley results are your money this
[00:58:00] looks cool I have a feeling Mar will
[00:58:02] have some pous encounters and crucial
[00:58:05] assistance along the way Oho I might
[00:58:08] just have to offer a helping hand myself
[00:58:11] the encounters and sword training
[00:58:13] experiences that March accumulates will
[00:58:15] dictate the nature of the story's
[00:58:17] conclusion the end result will always be
[00:58:20] a solo confrontation with Scott though
[00:58:23] the nature of The Showdown will also VAR
[00:58:26] according oh [ __ ] three Idol ending traz
[00:58:30] acit this isn't an event then right it's
[00:58:31] probably permanent March 7th wait no
[00:58:34] it's event wait but no way the idol on
[00:58:36] are temporary surely Miss March will
[00:58:39] prevail over Scott ABS it has to be pero
[00:58:44] as long as a sword master
[00:58:46] is no but events to worry about wise
[00:58:50] words yeah yeah it's Perma it's Perma

[00:58:59] will remember with fondness their
[00:59:01] unpredictable old I guess the other

[00:59:05] fair seem these old friends have
[00:59:08] appeared on the sieno appear they have
[00:59:11] and a medical intern from pentacon is on

[01:04:02] optimizations yet oh quality life system
[01:04:05] when using the filter function to screen
[01:04:07] relics already in your possession filter
[01:04:10] choices can be saved for a faster

[01:04:24] Relic set priority ization with the most
[01:04:27] suitable relics appearing first sure

[01:04:37] don't know why they don't just addad
[01:04:39] most frequently used Relic set but also
[01:04:41] the recommended Main and subsidiary
[01:04:44] stats that's still good though that's
[01:04:45] definitely better than nothing checking
[01:04:47] simulated Universe interface and Cavern
[01:04:49] of corrosion in the interal peace guide
[01:04:52] Trailblazers can see recommended
[01:04:55] characters for the relics in question
[01:04:57] how considerate now to allow triers to

[01:05:06] set it just shows like 60 characters ADV
[01:05:09] access feature for both trailblaze

[01:05:57] for the normal map and the temporary
[01:05:59] Maps unlocked as a result of advanced

[01:06:03] Trailblazers achieve the normal event
[01:06:05] activation requirements during the
