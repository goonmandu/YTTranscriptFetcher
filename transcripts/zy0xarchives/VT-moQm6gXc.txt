[00:03:28] need to protect Catherine's idea okay
[00:03:30] welcome for that Catherine yep
[00:03:35] the need up to Nate is just a trap
[00:03:38] if something were to happen my existence
[00:03:41] may be the only trump card we'll be able
[00:03:43] to play after all the Academia should
[00:03:45] still be unable to confirm the existence
[00:03:47] of my Consciousness in the outside world
[00:03:49] yep yep exactly and I love this okay
[00:03:53] also another question another question

[00:17:12] you just said it in the beginning okay
[00:17:13] cool awesome just do it dude no
[00:17:18] okay this is why I started this Quest
[00:17:21] offstream by the way I did the first
[00:17:23] five minutes because I tried to get the
[00:17:24] time
[00:17:25] I I keep [ __ ] his name because I'm
[00:17:27] saying tainary because she says that
[00:17:28] anyways I tried to get this part of the
[00:17:30] quest but I think I didn't get there
[00:17:31] it's like [ __ ] it
[00:17:33] it pertains to the safety of the Avidia
[00:17:35] forest's inhabitants
[00:17:37] huh what happened not long ago we
[00:17:41] received word that a section wait is
[00:17:43] this just actually Catherine seems to
[00:17:45] have become contaminated wait what the
[00:17:47] [ __ ]
[00:17:49] I mean
[00:17:50] a new I don't know did I skip this
[00:17:52] that's why because it's not the Arkham
[00:17:53] Festival to investigate the situation
[00:17:56] this is for
[00:18:01] [ __ ]
[00:18:04] wait she's not here anymore
[00:18:07] oh we're fine
[00:18:09] wait that's it
[00:18:12] okay cool
[00:18:19] I did I did needless Quest I fully
[00:18:21] finished it off stream I just couldn't
[00:18:22] do exactly it wouldn't let me
[00:18:26] nahida
[00:18:28] thank goodness you're okay
[00:18:35] I don't trust this
[00:18:37] this was supposed to be a tattoo reunion
[00:18:39] but your ruined actually it's very smart
[00:18:42] that the traveler okay right now
[00:18:45] after all the doctor has shown that his
[00:18:48] technology can apparently even control
[00:18:50] human Minds I mean are they humans if
[00:18:52] they're all NPCs
[00:18:55] it's not like you could have known what
[00:18:56] happened after we split up and I was
[00:18:58] facing the doctor by myself
[00:19:01] I mean okay if an archon lost a 1v1 to a
[00:19:04] fatoui Harbinger you don't deserve to be
[00:19:05] an archon I said it I'm sorry I said it
[00:19:07] I said it I'm sorry there should be a
[00:19:09] better arc on if you lose the datori you
[00:19:11] shouldn't be an archon maybe datori
[00:19:13] deserve to win that's all I'm saying
[00:19:16] hmm
[00:19:17] feels like only the real Nikita could
[00:19:19] come up with such an obscure analogy huh
[00:19:24] so when your trust
[00:19:28] is to clarify my point
[00:19:30] well we understand that point now please
[00:19:32] nahida tell us more about what happened
[00:19:34] are those poor people all right
[00:19:37] when you left I was still in the middle
[00:19:40] of restoring everyone's Minds
[00:19:42] thankfully when the doctor mentioned
[00:19:45] dude got slapped around by Senora but
[00:19:48] that's the Senora being better sorry
[00:19:50] she's built if you're not nice try
[00:19:52] unlucky continue being a Verdes inventor
[00:19:54] of support my bad bro
[00:19:56] like well I I didn't actually listen
[00:19:58] thankfully when the doctor said uh okay
[00:19:59] cool
[00:20:07] she's ripped Bozo yeah because ryden's a
[00:20:09] [ __ ] Giga chat right I was like [ __ ]
[00:20:11] you and then cut her in two luckily I
[00:20:14] managed to finish my Restorations and
[00:20:16] mine jump away from him just as he was
[00:20:18] about to capture me
[00:20:21] I still don't trust this I don't know
[00:20:23] I'm so sausage hidden cards but
[00:20:30] [Music]
[00:20:32] it's towards everyone's Minds which
[00:20:34] means we've lost another one of our
[00:20:36] Trump cards
[00:20:38] also the doctor is already an expert at
[00:20:42] modifying Akasha terminals
[00:20:45] maybe it's only a matter of time until
[00:20:47] he captures my Consciousness inside
[00:20:51] I feel like okay fair I trust her bit
[00:20:53] more now between mine
[00:20:55] we need to hurry
[00:20:57] he's toying with us
[00:21:02] apparently enough to make it worthy of
[00:21:05] being number
[00:21:07] yeah he is number two okay I guess he is
[00:21:09] pretty strong true true
[00:21:13] let's try to find another way to attack
[00:21:15] this problem
[00:21:16] actually nahida how did
[00:21:19] you were trying to get to do you think
[00:21:20] the Tori has an ego you think we can
[00:21:22] make fun of him for not being number one
[00:21:23] you think he deserves to be number one
[00:21:24] yes I have
[00:21:27] do you think that's how we defeat him we
[00:21:28] just make fun of his ego so introduced
[00:21:30] her destination by looking at the
[00:21:32] direction you were moving though

[00:24:40] reason she's happy and we're seeing this
[00:24:41] NPC that we typically wouldn't care
[00:24:43] about is so that we feel bad about
[00:24:45] someone dying but mihoyo doesn't want to
[00:24:46] kill off a character that's too
[00:24:48] important so they're making us like

[00:25:08] my current self has not only gained true
[00:25:11] Insight but I can even help you
[00:25:13] establish a direct connection to the
[00:25:15] consciousness
[00:25:16] you can do that oh
[00:25:19] do you believe her uh oh why would this

[00:25:51] don't do it pee on the ground to Sir
[00:25:54] dominance
[00:25:57] ready
[00:26:10] it took three betrayals for me to
[00:26:12] finally understand who's that the world
[00:26:15] is just an elaborate tablet that's scar
[00:26:17] eyes it is scarra this is edgy as [ __ ]
[00:26:21] will never will never be 12.

[00:27:29] so I said so you burned his house I
[00:27:32] denounced the world
[00:27:38] let's guess that imagine dying and then
[00:27:39] burned his house
[00:27:43] away every last trace of human emotion
[00:27:47] then it will be empty
[00:27:49] a blank slate wait these guys just

[00:28:39] you ever [ __ ] do that I like scarra
[00:28:41] but don't ever he's not in the same
[00:28:43] league as child [ __ ] you for saying that
[00:28:45] it's different
[00:28:47] Xiao still has a father though
[00:28:57] I know he is a puppet okay I know I get
[00:29:00] it I'm just I'm just joking don't don't
[00:29:03] take this literally okay my job is to be
[00:29:05] funny not smart
[00:29:07] do you know anything about xiao's
[00:29:08] parents

[00:29:35] I'm saying no I'm saying okay I'm
[00:29:37] actually saying my point here here's my
[00:29:39] conclusion if you're gonna take away one
[00:29:40] thing take away this my point is we can
[00:29:42] still fix scarra like I think he just
[00:29:44] needs a hug like I actually think he can
[00:29:46] be fixed I'm just saying I'm just saying
[00:29:49] I'm just saying I think he's just very
[00:29:51] sad but he doesn't want to let it out I
[00:29:53] think he just needs a hug and you could
[00:29:55] fix him I think Xiao is actually just
[00:29:56] suffering
[00:30:00] true
[00:30:02] Scara can be fixed that's what I'm
[00:30:04] saying it's good news it's good news he
[00:30:06] can be fixed the Tori can't the Tori is
[00:30:08] irreparable
[00:30:11] anyways
[00:30:13] actually the balladeer's memories
[00:30:14] everything matches what we know about

[00:33:30] here wait wait
[00:33:34] something feels different
[00:33:37] oh she possessed us Travelers back
[00:33:43] it seemed like she jumped over to you as
[00:33:46] an emergency measure right before the
[00:33:48] Catherine puppet was destroyed after
[00:33:50] that tainari heard the commotion and
[00:33:53] came he true how can travel to solo with
[00:33:56] the Tui Harbinger but can kill a couple
[00:33:58] of NPCs
[00:34:00] true
[00:34:02] I don't know maybe they got to the
[00:34:03] heater too fast you know
[00:34:06] what you swept places you mean your
[00:34:10] Consciousness also went into nahida's
[00:34:12] body oh wait we have to do that I just
[00:34:15] dude ruin you guys see the ruin we have
[00:34:17] to go do that I didn't even notice Paul
[00:34:19] we just found one
[00:34:20] [Music]
[00:34:24] never imagined
[00:34:25] an individ Consciousness could this
[00:34:26] could be transferred around like this
[00:34:29] had I not seen it with my own eyes I
[00:34:31] would have never believed it
[00:34:34] think this can be achieved with current
[00:34:35] humans wait guys so she was gone for a
[00:34:38] bit we and he wasn't controlled by Tory
[00:34:40] which means he has to have been on a
[00:34:42] date with I know there's no other option
[00:34:43] also while we were running the
[00:34:45] Consciousness in your body told me to
[00:34:46] pass on a message she said the doctor
[00:34:49] has found a way to trap my Consciousness
[00:34:51] so I can't Journey with you anymore oh
[00:34:54] damn
[00:34:55] wait does everybody have Catherine back
[00:34:57] in the adventures Guild but even in a
[00:35:00] moonless night let's go shower of
[00:35:02] starlight can still drown out Illusions
[00:35:04] and lies
[00:35:07] he is trapped in the sanctuary of Sirus
[00:35:10] thought I forgot this time was that
[00:35:12] message all she left for us it's pretty
[00:35:14] big
[00:35:16] the code that only we know we can't let
[00:35:18] the doctor figure out what we're up to
[00:35:20] that makes sense since the doctor
[00:35:22] captured her she won't be able to say
[00:35:24] anything without him knowing even in a
[00:35:27] moonless night a shower of starlight can
[00:35:30] still drown out Illusions and lies
[00:35:36] the moon Illusions and lies are from the
[00:35:39] alchemical Divination at the sub-zeros
[00:35:41] festival didn't nahida use a Starlight
[00:35:44] analogy before it had something to do
[00:35:47] with sataria
[00:35:50] the moon refers to nahira Starlight
[00:35:52] refers to the people of the desert
[00:35:53] Illusions and lies refers to the
[00:35:55] academia's plans
[00:35:59] but I'm on
[00:36:02] said sanctuary of surastana
[00:36:05] does this mean that this nahida you're
[00:36:08] talking about the Consciousness who was
[00:36:10] occupying this guy's actually clueless
[00:36:12] the dendro archon this is actually
[00:36:15] Clueless
[00:36:18] correct but that's all right a Scholar's
[00:36:22] curiosity doesn't need to be appeased
[00:36:23] right away
[00:36:25] as for the complicated nature of the
[00:36:27] situation
[00:36:28] safe to say I have witnessed that for
[00:36:30] myself I've spent some time with you and
[00:36:33] it looks like the dendro archons also on
[00:36:35] your side so
[00:36:37] I trust you oh thank you
[00:36:40] oh actually we came here to ask you a
[00:36:42] question what do you know about the
[00:36:44] project that the sages have been working
[00:36:45] on ah that
[00:36:48] while I was indeed invited to join that
[00:36:51] project
[00:36:52] all I know is that that project has
[00:36:55] something to do with the restoration of
[00:36:57] Urban Soul
[00:36:58] huh did you see something when you were
[00:37:01] in the evening is turning the balladeer
[00:37:03] into a god true
[00:37:05] wait why is he called the Battle of the
[00:37:07] Year I thought it was The Wanderer I
[00:37:09] thought it was Skyrim why I just have
[00:37:10] three names dude who cares I don't care
[00:37:13] about lore just give him one name
[00:37:15] one name please please you can make a
[00:37:19] lower loophole to give him a name four
[00:37:21] what's the fourth one
[00:37:23] Connie
[00:37:26] I can't read that okay Big K what do you
[00:37:30] have any evidence
[00:37:34] five okay
[00:37:37] uh God okay
[00:37:41] yeah
[00:37:42] [Music]
[00:37:44] yo Dexter I think that's three months
[00:37:46] it's what happened
[00:37:48] that explains why hapagious symptoms
[00:37:51] are those the things you have to kill
[00:37:53] with like cryo or it's because like the
[00:37:55] hype with the hypostasis God is that
[00:37:58] like the process of being born
[00:38:07] I noticed tapatious mental anomalies the
[00:38:09] mental anomalies geez bro chills
[00:38:13] Di and began searching for a way to
[00:38:16] return her to her normal self it's gonna
[00:38:18] just call this a mental anomaly that's
[00:38:21] actually
[00:38:24] if I didn't take action
[00:38:26] pagia would have already been he said
[00:38:28] this Cara stands a mental anomaly
[00:38:30] exactly
[00:38:33] now that you mention it I knew the
[00:38:36] Academia has never thought particularly
[00:38:39] highly of lesser Lord kusan Ali but
[00:38:43] but I still didn't expect them to do
[00:38:45] something as arrogant as creating a new
[00:38:48] God yeah that makes sense looks like I
[00:38:49] made the right decision by not accepting
[00:38:51] their invitation the doctor and the
[00:38:54] balladeer
[00:39:00] sounds like from your description I
[00:39:02] don't think they've completed their
[00:39:04] project there may still be room for us
[00:39:06] to intervene true then
[00:39:09] what is the connection between creating
[00:39:11] a new God and restoring ehrmann's Soul
[00:39:15] yeah it feels like we're still nowhere
[00:39:18] close to figuring out the Sage's goals
[00:39:21] great we've pretty much gone over
[00:39:23] everything we need to know I'll stay
[00:39:25] here for now
[00:39:26] still want to try a few more things to
[00:39:28] help don't try to help her just shoot
[00:39:29] her bro shoot her literally nip her in
[00:39:31] the butt oh I brute you that that'll be
[00:39:34] your come find me here if there's
[00:39:36] anything else I can do to help cool all
[00:39:39] right let's go to the thing we saw in

[00:43:15] there's no need to thank me I've never
[00:43:17] cared to keep track of personal favors
[00:43:20] all I did was correct a mistake I

[00:43:24] developed at the Academia
[00:43:27] well why is he so tall wait a second
[00:43:31] not as tall as Chow but yeah so we know

[00:43:40] same thing as I told where you press in
[00:43:41] he's like but I'll hide them so it's
[00:43:43] better oh
[00:43:45] so you've already landed yourselves on
[00:43:47] The academia's Hit List
[00:43:50] I can't say that I didn't expect it
[00:43:52] however
[00:43:54] and I wish to turn you over to the
[00:43:55] Academia don't you think you'd already
[00:43:58] be the aeromite's honored guests by now
[00:44:00] true right
[00:44:02] um you do have a point
[00:44:06] I have no interest in running errands
[00:44:08] for that project
[00:44:10] as a scholar I've always belonged to the
[00:44:12] camp that promotes research or autonomy
[00:44:15] and these days you're more fascinating
[00:44:17] than anything the sages can offer
[00:44:20] pog
[00:44:23] dude what is he wearing by the way why
[00:44:24] is it like see-through it's distracting
[00:44:26] it's like shanha's outfit it's like I
[00:44:28] get like why are you distracting me why
[00:44:31] not quite
[00:44:33] to tell you the truth I'm still
[00:44:35] investigating the Divine knowledge
[00:44:36] capsule
[00:44:37] unfortunately I've run into some
[00:44:40] difficulties everyone says the capsule
[00:44:42] originated in the desert and was
[00:44:44] eventually moved to Port ormos
[00:44:46] if I'm to get to the bottom of this I
[00:44:49] must understand how the capsule first
[00:44:51] came to be which brings me back to you
[00:44:53] and why you're so interesting I'm
[00:44:56] interested
[00:44:57] use the Divine knowledge capsule right
[00:45:00] in front of you and upon seeing him your
[00:45:02] expression became perplexed and you were
[00:45:05] lost and thought for quite some time to
[00:45:08] have that kind of reaction I think you
[00:45:10] must have realized something
[00:45:12] are you interested at all in Sharing
[00:45:14] what you've been hiding
[00:45:15] oh I didn't mean to click I'm not hiding
[00:45:18] anything I'll hide them it was because I
[00:45:19] was so shocked to hear those words again
[00:45:20] World forget me
[00:45:29] so that's your answer oh he's
[00:45:32] disappointed wow I'm sorry for the
[00:45:34] Academia after all
[00:45:36] so considering that it is indeed wise to
[00:45:39] keep your cards close to your chest
[00:45:41] but speaking of Chess you do have some
[00:45:43] undisclosed information about the Divine
[00:45:45] knowledge capsule am I right
[00:45:48] no matter
[00:45:50] rather than simply learning the answers
[00:45:51] from you I'd still prefer to investigate
[00:45:54] on my own
[00:45:55] speaking of you two are also headed to
[00:45:58] the desert
[00:46:00] you have the same plan as you but we
[00:46:02] don't really have any concrete goals at
[00:46:04] the moment
[00:46:05] the night suggests starting with but is
[00:46:07] Fort almost theme starting the largest
[00:46:09] settlement in the desert so it'll
[00:46:10] probably have more resources and until
[00:46:12] then no it's not for almost I don't know
[00:46:14] but this seems kind of buzzing
[00:46:15] would you like to head there together
[00:46:17] wait what do you say a certainly Village
[00:46:19] okay going together let's head together
[00:46:25] true
[00:46:26] time on you could leave us no one likes
[00:46:28] you go away
[00:46:30] where'd he go
[00:46:31] bam
[00:46:33] fine he'll meet us there
[00:46:39] before us lies aru Village the safe
[00:46:42] haven of the desert Folk
[00:46:44] wow it's Lance
[00:46:56] oh
[00:47:05] wait
[00:47:08] why are we fighting Sino
[00:47:14] what the double caca
[00:47:18] cheese
[00:47:23] dude relax we can all be together it's
[00:47:25] we can be a unit we can work as a team
[00:47:28] you don't have to fight we can
[00:47:41] unless my memory fails me we have barely
[00:47:45] spoken two words to each other before
[00:47:47] now at the Academia
[00:47:49] would you care to enlighten me as to
[00:47:52] when and how I invited the general
[00:47:53] mahamatra's Wrath I hate them
[00:47:57] do not think you can escape my judgment
[00:47:59] just because you managed to escape my
[00:48:02] attack oh judgments judgment so that's
[00:48:06] how you'd characterize your actions here
[00:48:07] is it or would elimination perhaps be a
[00:48:10] more accurate description had I used my
[00:48:13] full strength not even this traveler
[00:48:15] would have been able to stop me
[00:48:18] them those styled like an assassination
[00:48:20] I sought only to ensure that my target
[00:48:23] would be unable to flee or resist why
[00:48:25] are you explaining bro no one asked
[00:48:27] practice sorry sorry I'm sorry
[00:48:29] I'm sorry it seemed to me more like your
[00:48:31] own personal touch
[00:48:32] [Music]
[00:48:41] General mahamatra Sino head of all the
[00:48:44] Mantra at the Academia
[00:48:47] he's a formidable Hunter and the
[00:48:49] Ultimate Nightmare for any who have
[00:48:51] committed that's why the Jeff hates him
[00:48:52] because he's like a cop he seem to have
[00:48:54] placed a lot of trust and I'll hate them
[00:48:55] to the point of blocking I remember
[00:48:57] people telling me every time he said a
[00:48:59] dialogue lines and Jeff would talk like
[00:49:00] four hours
[00:49:03] I wouldn't believe a single word that
[00:49:05] comes out of his mouth
[00:49:07] I have been pursuing this scribe for a
[00:49:09] long time
[00:49:10] I urge you
[00:49:12] stand back and do not seek to defend him
[00:49:15] any longer
[00:49:16] otherwise
[00:49:18] there will be consequences
[00:49:20] I don't trust him as much as he seems to
[00:49:22] think but that doesn't mean I'm going to
[00:49:23] stand by and do nothing
[00:49:26] I won't waste my breath explaining
[00:49:28] things
[00:49:29] are haitham
[00:49:31] I saw it during our fight take it out
[00:49:36] waiting on your person yeah take it out
[00:49:39] yeah for myself yeah do it
[00:49:43] very perceptive of you nothing escapes a
[00:49:47] mantra's senses
[00:49:51] what the [ __ ] is that how did he keep it
[00:49:53] there he doesn't have pockets where did
[00:49:55] he keep that
[00:49:56] [Music]
[00:49:59] no wonder you speak with such confidence
[00:50:01] Sino
[00:50:02] but I must admit is that what he used to
[00:50:05] cheat in chess
[00:50:06] what does this capsule mean to you and
[00:50:09] why as general mahamatra of the Academia
[00:50:12] are you all alone in the desert
[00:50:14] as far as I'm aware the other Mantra
[00:50:17] have been speculating about your
[00:50:18] disappearance
[00:50:19] have you been given a mission that's
[00:50:22] let's say morally dubious
[00:50:25] if I was the real Target of your mission
[00:50:28] what was stopping you from Simply using
[00:50:30] your Authority and resources to judge me
[00:50:32] within the walls of the Academia
[00:50:39] I should have known you'd be difficult
[00:50:41] to deal with
[00:50:42] um not kiss
[00:50:44] what should we do traveler my Mom feels
[00:50:47] like we can't trust either of them
[00:50:50] um well look at you two acting all tough
[00:50:52] and self-righteous over there

[00:51:05] you gotta help us out here

[00:51:18] for sure
[00:51:19] listen I know you academic types love to
[00:51:22] fill up your big brains with
[00:51:23] self-righteous morality and Lord your
[00:51:25] empty rules and virtues over each other
[00:51:27] but how dare you bring your petty
[00:51:30] disputes into the city yeah how dare you
[00:51:31] bring your petty disputes seems like

[00:53:48] as a guardian charged with the
[00:53:49] responsibility to protect my fellow
[00:53:51] villagers from harm I was observing your
[00:53:54] conflict from afar even before the
[00:53:56] sandstorm started
[00:53:58] and now that you've set foot with an
[00:53:59] aura Village itself it is all the more
[00:54:02] my responsibility everyone in this cut

[00:54:10] conversation with one another and put
[00:54:12] your hostile feelings to rest if anyone

[00:54:17] are under this roof
[00:54:19] I will not hesitate to send them out for
[00:54:21] some quality time with the creatures of
[00:54:23] the sandstorm dumb
[00:54:29] and that goes for you too Miss Dia oh do
[00:54:32] I make myself clear
[00:54:34] all right we got it Candace
[00:54:39] that's what I like to hear
[00:54:41] so
[00:54:43] which of you will begin I'm kind of
[00:54:45] getting a chat from Candice mediator
[00:54:55] trying to be a mediator she's trying
[00:54:58] it's Daya shut up I'm on I have nothing
[00:55:00] to hide
[00:55:01] so there's no except your nipples why
[00:55:03] does I don't have no nipples explain
[00:55:04] that can you explain it wrong about the
[00:55:06] other Mantra not knowing my whereabouts
[00:55:09] it's not because I've been assigned a
[00:55:11] morally dubious Mission rather Dante
[00:55:14] Park he literally doesn't have anything
[00:55:15] this isn't being me being weird
[00:55:20] a little while ago
[00:55:22] I discovered that there was Data missing
[00:55:24] in the academius project Planning and
[00:55:26] Development files
[00:55:28] what little they did report clearly did
[00:55:31] not match the Project's actual progress
[00:55:33] as general mahamatra
[00:55:36] I had the responsibility and authority
[00:55:39] to request an audit
[00:55:41] however
[00:55:42] to my surprise the person responsible
[00:55:45] for the erroneous data was none other
[00:55:48] than Grand sages are himself I tried to
[00:55:51] investigate the issue myself before
[00:55:53] submitting a formal audit request
[00:55:56] but I soon found that all leads and
[00:55:59] potential pieces of incriminating
[00:56:00] evidence
[00:56:02] I began to realize that they were
[00:56:05] cautious of me from the very beginning
[00:56:08] surprisingly the grand Sage rejected my
[00:56:10] audit request as soon as the submission
[00:56:12] reached his desk
[00:56:14] he even said to me
[00:56:16] the power of the general mahamatra is
[00:56:18] granted by the Sages
[00:56:21] you have no right to judge us
[00:56:25] I realized
[00:56:27] the matcha are nothing more than tools
[00:56:30] for the sages to assert and maintain
[00:56:32] their control over knowledge
[00:56:34] the vows that we took
[00:56:36] the principles that we strive to uphold
[00:56:40] they are meaningless to the Academia of
[00:56:42] today
[00:56:43] [Music]
[00:56:47] okay so you decided to Exile yourself it
[00:56:49] would be wise to flee the Academia
[00:56:51] before the sages had a chance to take
[00:56:53] action against me
[00:56:54] this way they can no longer see nor
[00:56:58] predict my ass that's just people
[00:56:59] talking I will never give up on this
[00:57:01] investigation
[00:57:02] there's no need for someone else to give
[00:57:04] me power or authority
[00:57:07] okay surely we're all friends now surely
[00:57:09] we're all friends I will administer
[00:57:11] judgment judgment that's why this
[00:57:13] judgment lays upon you your Penance is
[00:57:16] due
[00:57:19] to plus now that he's no longer the
[00:57:21] general mahamatra he's somehow
[00:57:25] if that's your story then why did you
[00:57:28] see all
[00:57:29] hate it
[00:57:30] when I was investigating the matter in
[00:57:32] the Academia
[00:57:34] I overheard a conversation between all
[00:57:36] Haytham and a sage
[00:57:38] just asked you to investigate a blonde
[00:57:40] hair traveler do you dispute this I'll
[00:57:44] hate them
[00:57:45] wow wow just what I thought we were
[00:57:49] friends yeah now what
[00:57:53] like many parts of the project this
[00:57:56] assignment was undocumented yeah
[00:57:58] now throw in your suspicious Behavior
[00:58:00] yes Behavior capsule wait did someone
[00:58:03] say sauce I think we deserve an
[00:58:04] explanation yeah
[00:58:06] yeah
[00:58:08] yes
[00:58:09] I was indeed tasked with investigating
[00:58:12] The Traveler
[00:58:13] after all the promised reward was so
[00:58:16] great that hardly any scholar could have
[00:58:18] refused
[00:58:20] the sage told me
[00:58:22] once you've completed this assignment I
[00:58:25] can give you a glimpse of divine
[00:58:27] knowledge
[00:58:28] wait his either like turquoise
[00:58:32] the most unfortunately those academics
[00:58:34] don't know me at all
[00:58:36] their words contained one key piece of
[00:58:39] information namely that Divine knowledge
[00:58:42] indeed exists that gave me all I needed
[00:58:45] to know
[00:58:46] from my perspective the sages are far
[00:58:49] from trustworthy
[00:58:51] think about it
[00:58:52] isn't it a little strange they're so
[00:58:54] willing to share Divine knowledge with
[00:58:56] anyone even as reward true
[00:59:00] so I began my own investigation
[00:59:03] following the lead of the Divine
[00:59:05] knowledge capsule
[00:59:06] in the end I realized my wisdom in
[00:59:09] committing to this rather than
[00:59:10] collaborating with the sages
[00:59:12] and I've been less guarded I probably
[00:59:15] would have ended up like that einel
[00:59:17] ahmar mercenary incapable of remaining
[00:59:20] sane for long enough to hold a
[00:59:21] conversation
[00:59:23] you mean
[00:59:25] but the sages originally planned to
[00:59:27] dispose of you using one of those
[00:59:29] capsules that drive people insane
[00:59:32] what you encounter with me did you join
[00:59:33] forces just so you could investigate me
[00:59:35] already given up on the assignment by
[00:59:36] then
[00:59:37] I only told the Academia I was waiting
[00:59:40] in Port oromos for you to appear so they
[00:59:42] wouldn't suspect anything
[00:59:43] so it came as quite a surprise when I
[00:59:45] encountered my erstwhile Target while
[00:59:47] investigating the Divine knowledge
[00:59:49] capsule
[00:59:50] criminals do love to talk about
[00:59:52] coincidences Fido stop being a covered
[00:59:55] once
[00:59:57] 170 I'm sorry I'm sorry I ran into the
[01:00:00] traveler by chance I had no intention of
[01:00:02] providing assistance to the Academia
[01:00:04] also you should remember you were the
[01:00:07] ones who decided to follow me and strike
[01:00:09] up a conversation after I left that
[01:00:10] Tavern
[01:00:11] yeah cause you're hot
[01:00:13] I'll hear some help to sad at Caravan
[01:00:16] rebought this one I'm willing to
[01:00:17] apologize if that's worth anything to
[01:00:19] you I took the Divine knowledge capsule
[01:00:21] behind your back because I judged its
[01:00:24] existence to be a significant risk
[01:00:26] I felt that it would be best for no one
[01:00:28] to interact with it before it had been
[01:00:30] properly studied
[01:00:32] after all
[01:00:34] curiosity often proves to be the most
[01:00:36] dangerous thing in this land
[01:00:38] you should be well aware scribe I'll
[01:00:40] hate them that Curiosity can also lead
[01:00:43] you to danger and suspicion
[01:00:46] answer do they keep saying
[01:00:48] any information about their project with
[01:00:51] you
[01:00:52] have I not made myself clear
[01:00:54] you and I are both distrusted by the
[01:00:57] Academia do you really think they would
[01:01:00] tell me anything
[01:01:01] fine
[01:01:03] although you have been completely proven
[01:01:05] your innocence
[01:01:06] I won't regard you as an enemy for now
[01:01:09] As You Wish
[01:01:12] good I'm glad to see you two clearing up
[01:01:16] your misunderstandings and now you deal
[01:01:18] yeah
[01:01:21] oh sorry do you like one of the boys
[01:01:23] must have been so boring that I spaced
[01:01:26] out
[01:01:27] um my situation is pretty
[01:01:29] straightforward my employer doing your
[01:01:32] Zod of the homi Yani family is friends
[01:01:34] with the traveler and is currently
[01:01:36] recovering from her illness at home
[01:01:38] okay I had nothing going on so I decided
[01:01:41] to return to our village for a visit I
[01:01:43] was actually looking forward to a pretty
[01:01:45] exciting time getting back together with
[01:01:47] everyone here okay then I saw these two
[01:01:49] random guys in the middle of a pointless
[01:01:51] argument it'd take me off and things
[01:01:53] went downhill from there is that all
[01:01:57] well I will admit that definitely sounds
[01:02:00] like your style
[01:02:02] in that case
[01:02:03] welcome back dear
[01:02:06] that's more like it I missed you all so
[01:02:08] much Candace

[01:02:18] but you're no longer at each other's
[01:02:20] throats please make yourselves at home
[01:02:23] I'll take a quick trip outside to clear
[01:02:25] out some of those creatures in the
[01:02:26] sandstorm thanks Candace
[01:02:30] fighting in a sandstorm is not for the
[01:02:32] faint-hearted
[01:02:33] anyone without extensive training in
[01:02:35] these conditions is at a disadvantage
[01:02:37] you needn't worry
[01:02:39] yeah just leave them to Candace don't
[01:02:41] worry she's as tough as they come boy
[01:02:43] how do you know

[01:02:52] sandstorm's over right Candace still

[01:03:04] little DG no more Candace all right

[01:03:09] the boys are as chatty as the floor

[01:03:50] never mind
[01:03:55] yes
[01:03:57] they just keep coming in waves
[01:03:59] I've lost count of how many I've
[01:04:01] defeated
[01:04:02] before I realized it even the sandstorm
[01:04:05] had stopped not only is she really
[01:04:07] strong her stone is also something else
[01:04:11] leave this around us I got interrupted
[01:04:14] earlier but now I have something to take
[01:04:16] my anger out on
[01:04:19] it's been quite a while since I've seen
[01:04:21] the flame Mane in action flame main I'll
[01:04:24] leave these to you then
[01:04:25] I'll be sure to put on a good show
[01:04:28] wait do you get her as a trial character
[01:04:30] no we don't I would have heard about it
[01:04:32] [ __ ]
[01:04:39] bro what am I doing
[01:04:42] one with nature
[01:04:51] dude why don't we get a trial there
[01:04:55] shoot
[01:04:58] the creature stopped appearing was that
[01:05:01] the last of them
[01:05:04] what we thought just now was probably
[01:05:05] the aftermath of the sandstorm well
[01:05:07] fought everyone whoa who the injuries I
[01:05:10] hope bro who are you
[01:05:13] huh
[01:05:16] I apologies I haven't had a chance to
[01:05:19] greet you yet I had my hands full taking
[01:05:21] care of the villages elderly and
[01:05:24] children bro who are you I am the chief
[01:05:27] of Arrow Village everyone usually calls
[01:05:29] me uncle anpu
[01:05:32] cool sir I am also originally from the
[01:05:35] desert
[01:05:36] but I have not been back for some time
[01:05:38] now
[01:05:39] may I ask if such sandstorms are common
[01:05:42] I can't say they've always been common
[01:05:45] but recently the storms have become
[01:05:48] increasingly severe should I add old
[01:05:51] what the [ __ ] is old sandstorms we also
[01:05:54] occasionally get earthquakes according
[01:05:57] to an investigator who stayed in the
[01:06:00] village a while ago these unusual
[01:06:02] natural phenomena are related to the
[01:06:05] withering of Urban Soul
[01:06:15] withering zones in the forest and
[01:06:18] sandstorms and earthquakes here in the
[01:06:20] desert everything in the natural world
[01:06:22] is inextricably connected to Urban Soul
[01:06:25] these Regional symptoms can indeed be a
[01:06:28] reflection of urban Soul's present State
[01:06:30] cool everyone in our village needs to
[01:06:33] take good care of themselves uh speaking
[01:06:36] of which why haven't I seen a single
[01:06:38] Village their dad's the Tory moment
[01:06:41] [Music]
[01:06:43] does your curiosity no no bounds Village
[01:06:47] keeper is how aru Village refers to Mad
[01:06:50] Scholars exactly yeah yeah yes I know
[01:06:54] I'm a little stupid
[01:06:57] after a period of training in the Avidia
[01:06:59] Forest
[01:07:00] the Academia believes that they're
[01:07:02] crazed mutterings may have a negative
[01:07:04] effect on the psyches of other Scholars
[01:07:07] so
[01:07:08] they're forcibly exiled to the desert
[01:07:11] now if you ask me
[01:07:13] it's all a boatload of nonsense
[01:07:16] alas that's exactly what we've been
[01:07:19] trying to investigate One By One The
[01:07:22] Village keepers have been mysteriously
[01:07:25] disappearing Without a Trace Trace
[01:07:27] during the village has ever seen them
[01:07:29] leave if you're planning to stay around
[01:07:32] the village for the next few days I'd
[01:07:35] appreciate it if you could keep an eye
[01:07:37] out for them I've had encounters with
[01:07:39] those people in the past
[01:07:41] I'll see what I can do to help the match
[01:07:44] were the ones responsible for their
[01:07:45] exile
[01:07:46] now that you're no longer with them are
[01:07:49] you trying to alleviate your guilt in
[01:07:51] its own past sins
[01:07:53] I'm fascinated by how you um
[01:07:56] mock me if you will
[01:07:58] guilty
[01:08:00] I will eliminate you regardless of my
[01:08:03] position or identity
[01:08:05] oh you're the former General mahamatra
[01:08:09] you must be Informer in these kinds of
[01:08:11] Investigations is it because you're
[01:08:13] reminded of a pasia shut up
[01:08:16] shut up my mind
[01:08:19] I'll be grateful for the assistance
[01:08:22] no doubt you will do a better job than
[01:08:24] some of my former subordinates not
[01:08:27] paying attention I did pay attention
[01:08:28] it's like does that remind you of
[01:08:29] hypatia but are you sure it's good to go
[01:08:31] with Sino I read it I just didn't want
[01:08:32] to hear her say it
[01:08:34] what up foddle wait let's go back
[01:08:56] although I've sent myself into exile
[01:09:00] I'm still doing essentially the same
[01:09:01] things as before
[01:09:03] do you still have any questions for me
[01:09:05] before we start our investigation why do
[01:09:08] they refer to the Mad Scholars as
[01:09:09] Village Keepers subordinates told me
[01:09:11] that this title has its origins in a
[01:09:14] strange incident yeah Academia has long
[01:09:16] exiled mad Scholars to aru Village
[01:09:19] a mysterious phenomenon exists here okay
[01:09:22] mad Scholars first arrive
[01:09:25] they are as incoherent and deranged as
[01:09:27] before
[01:09:29] but
[01:09:31] after spending some time here
[01:09:36] initially
[01:09:37] the people of aru Village greatly
[01:09:39] resented having to take in the Mad
[01:09:41] Scholars
[01:09:43] but a strange incident one night changed
[01:09:46] that
[01:09:47] [Music]
[01:09:48] aru Village was struck by the strongest
[01:09:51] earthquake in living memory
[01:09:54] seeing buildings on the verge of
[01:09:56] collapse all around him thumb the then
[01:09:58] chief of the village oh no the chief is
[01:10:01] dead to safety suddenly
[01:10:04] he noticed a mad scholar crouching the
[01:10:06] corner caressing the ground with his
[01:10:08] hands
[01:10:10] soft green light radiated from them
[01:10:14] like a Divine glow against the backdrop
[01:10:16] of night
[01:10:17] despite the powerful Tremors that ripped
[01:10:19] through the ground that night
[01:10:21] all the houses remained upright
[01:10:24] almost as if they had grown Roots
[01:10:26] reaching deep into the ground
[01:10:29] in the end
[01:10:31] not a single building collapsed and no
[01:10:34] one was hurt wait a second after that
[01:10:36] the people of aru Village treated the
[01:10:38] Mad Scholars with greater kindness and
[01:10:41] began to refer to them as the village
[01:10:43] why do you want everyone dead because
[01:10:45] maybe it's good for some characters to
[01:10:46] die
[01:10:50] [Music]
[01:10:51] it must have been nahida she protected
[01:10:54] the villagers
[01:10:55] [Music]
[01:10:56] do you know if any of the Mad Scholars
[01:10:59] continued to wear their Akasha terminals
[01:11:01] at aru Village in theory they would
[01:11:04] continue wearing them so the Academia
[01:11:06] could still monitor their activities
[01:11:09] with that said
[01:11:10] the main Akasha system would no longer
[01:11:13] have any interaction with them
[01:11:21] it was probably nahida who calmed them
[01:11:25] if you are able to draw a conclusion
[01:11:26] from this one story alone
[01:11:29] then it appears you possess much more
[01:11:31] information than I do
[01:11:33] so what do you make of the story
[01:11:36] the Mad Scholar's power likely came from
[01:11:39] lesser Lord kusanali
[01:11:41] really
[01:11:44] what you don't believe us
[01:11:47] no it's not so much that I don't believe
[01:11:50] you
[01:11:51] I'm just struck by your reasoning Master
[01:11:54] Lord kusunali the current dendro archon
[01:11:58] she really active in sumero the Academia
[01:12:02] has always placed far greater importance
[01:12:04] on The Late greater Lord Ruka devata and
[01:12:07] he's dead if more or less ignored lesser
[01:12:09] Lord kusanali so now what and I've never
[01:12:12] had any reason to doubt their views
[01:12:14] in addition
[01:12:16] I've never heard any stories about
[01:12:17] lesser Lord cousinalli and her Deeds
[01:12:21] to me she Whatever It Is Well have been
[01:12:23] a God that never existed she's dead
[01:12:28] I don't know Laura okay
[01:12:32] she's a good archon who's kind and wise
[01:12:36] even if she says weird stuff sometimes
[01:12:39] I've spent many years interrogating
[01:12:41] criminals so I can easily tell when
[01:12:45] someone is lying
[01:12:46] good then you should know that we're
[01:12:49] telling the truth
[01:12:50] that look in your eyes
[01:12:54] I have never seen that from a liar
[01:12:57] okay I've never seen that from a liar
[01:13:02] our archon has been amongst us this
[01:13:04] entire time among us all right now it's
[01:13:07] our turn to put our skills to good use
[01:13:09] for this investigation
[01:13:19] [Music]
[01:13:25] maybe we can start by knocking on some
[01:13:28] I'm surely there's no more among uses
[01:13:31] wait oops are you here to help me find
[01:13:35] my grandpa huh
[01:13:37] who are you

[01:14:24] help I won't be a nuisance ah so you're
[01:14:28] the one who was eavesdropping on us
[01:14:30] around the village Chief's house I was
[01:14:32] planning to go out and take care of
[01:14:34] whoever it was
[01:14:36] but I had a vague feel whoa
[01:14:38] oh Ethan wasn't kidding about me
[01:14:42] okay I made jokes about him being a
[01:14:44] furry but he's literally like dog wolf
[01:14:46] senses he's actually fully furry he's
[01:14:49] actually completely yeah he definitely
[01:14:51] barks sorry
[01:14:52] in his spare time
[01:14:55] it won't work Grandpa
[01:14:59] 's I know
[01:15:01] but first let's confirm the facts with
[01:15:04] Candace
[01:15:09] I have to wait until night oh never mind
[01:15:11] where is she
[01:15:18] okay cool I like engine impact very fun
[01:15:23] foreign
[01:15:30] [Music]
[01:15:42] he just wanted to confirm something with
[01:15:43] you
[01:15:44] do you know a boy by the name of isak
[01:15:48] I had a feeling he'd go looking for you
[01:15:51] huh yes
[01:15:54] although he tried his best to stay
[01:15:56] hidden I still noticed him eavesdropping
[01:15:59] outside the window
[01:16:00] he really wants to get his grandfather
[01:16:02] back esoc's parents were both aeromite
[01:16:05] mercenaries who rarely returned to the
[01:16:07] Village after finding employees the size
[01:16:09] of cringe forcing another useless child
[01:16:11] into the plot line dies of cringe okay
[01:16:14] listen I'm sure Isaac is is goaded okay
[01:16:16] I'm sure I'm sure this guy has like a
[01:16:19] vision it was only a few years
[01:16:21] way
[01:16:24] very young at the
[01:16:25] young at the various families in the
[01:16:27] village took turns caring for him so he
[01:16:29] could survive
[01:16:31] can this mic is peeking really I didn't
[01:16:33] hear it later
[01:16:35] an elderly mad scholar arrived at the
[01:16:37] village
[01:16:38] isoc thought the scholar bore striking
[01:16:41] oh on the s's grandfather
[01:16:43] and thus often spied on the man
[01:16:47] so I had that in my audio hey Candice if
[01:16:50] you ever need some audio uh help hey
[01:16:52] come to me trust me I got you can have a
[01:16:55] one-to-one conversation I'm really good

[01:16:59] nblc right now don't worry I can uh
[01:17:02] uh your audio in two seconds or less can
[01:17:05] be perfect what I did my s's repeating
[01:17:07] on my recording I added something called
[01:17:08] a de-esser uh uh a noise
[01:17:12] um a a TDS or plug-in and it helped it
[01:17:18] however the scholar wasn't kept in
[01:17:20] appearance and incoherent in speech
[01:17:23] although esoc referred to the manus's
[01:17:25] grandpa yeah her s's are actually
[01:17:27] peaking and didn't dare to approach him
[01:17:31] One Summer Night [ __ ] why did you
[01:17:34] mention a job I didn't notice and now I
[01:17:36] can't stop hearing it
[01:17:38] then [ __ ] you okay now this is annoying
[01:17:41] isoc hiding in the distance
[01:17:46] so Grandpa walked up to isoc and patted
[01:17:48] him on the head [ __ ] you guys he even
[01:17:50] took Esau to the entrance of the village
[01:17:52] where he patiently taught the boy the
[01:17:54] names of the stars and accompanied his
[01:17:57] sock until he fell asleep
[01:17:59] foreign
[01:18:01] the next morning
[01:18:03] isak woke up and wanted to go find his
[01:18:05] grandpa again
[01:18:07] only to realize his grandpa no longer
[01:18:09] recognized him whoa whoa what however
[01:18:12] even so
[01:18:14] Grandpa obtained his calm expression
