[00:15:22] then in the you guys couldn't see it but
[00:15:24] there was a dog that came up on my
[00:15:25] keyboard while we were fighting Senora
[00:15:26] at the end which me that I couldn't beat
[00:15:28] her and then that happened and yeah but
[00:15:30] I saved the puppy he was actually
[00:15:31] injured so I helped fix his leg and now
[00:15:33] we're okay okay that was a lot okay so

[00:18:13] of your hosts today atsu I'm not
[00:18:15] affiliated to any of the team names that
[00:18:17] you see today for those of you that
[00:18:19] missed it and I'm joined by the one only
[00:18:22] winning good morning
[00:18:26] everyone so today we will also have
[00:18:29] continuing on from yesterday a bunch of
[00:18:31] giveaways from our absolutely wonderful
[00:18:34] sponsor one plus as you can see these

[00:18:50] twitch chats most importantly though
[00:18:53] twitch.tv/ ASR Carnival that is a s r a
[00:18:57] c a r n IV so as you can see down here
[00:19:01] this is some of the stuff that you can

[00:19:04] turned on so that people can contact you
[00:19:06] as well if you do win hopefully people
[00:19:08] from my community can win and from win's
[00:19:10] Community as well that's right so U what
[00:19:14] did you think of the competition
[00:19:16] yesterday I know we uh talked a little
[00:19:19] and you were mentioning that you're a
[00:19:21] little disappointed by the uh ar60
[00:19:24] gameplay that we saw displayed on stage
[00:19:27] what are your thoughts today some of the
[00:19:29] ar60 gameplay we saw was definitely very
[00:19:32] very very embarrassing you know coming
[00:19:34] out from zionic and also Tonto I did
[00:19:37] expect a little bit more granted they
[00:19:39] did have a reasonable excuse that they
[00:19:41] did go first because you did see the
[00:19:43] other team had a similar team
[00:19:45] composition but probably slightly more
[00:19:47] improved with the Nita pick as well
[00:19:49] which turns out was psyo in control of
[00:19:52] psycho or rather psycho was in control
[00:19:54] of the Nita yesterday and that character
[00:19:57] came out very very clutch we had some
[00:19:59] strong fighting words from definitely
[00:20:01] fob Master today and not psycho doing
[00:20:03] all the heavy lifting today but
[00:20:05] hopefully we're going to see a more
[00:20:06] close competition we are going to have
[00:20:08] another boss fight towards the end as
[00:20:10] well Boss Rush towards the end rather so
[00:20:13] I'm very much looking forward to that
[00:20:15] lots of points on the line today mhm and
[00:20:18] as we mentioned uh yesterday it is still
[00:20:22] anyone's
[00:20:23] game I do believe that the winners or
[00:20:28] the team in the lead was atsu's unpaid
[00:20:32] employees I'm still trying to get my hat
[00:20:34] around these unpaid employees team
[00:20:37] psycho and fob Master they are the ones
[00:20:39] in the lead right now I think they have
[00:20:40] over a 300 point lead on the opposition
[00:20:44] which is atsu's neglected children once
[00:20:46] again not affiliated to myself in any
[00:20:49] way shape or form so this is the team
[00:20:51] preview as you can see we have twano and
[00:20:53] Z we may have boxbox joining us later on
[00:20:56] in the day as a special guest but these
[00:20:59] are the the information that we know
[00:21:01] Tonto AKA Jake there very beautiful
[00:21:04] photo actually that photo you know you
[00:21:06] see that shoulder there that's actually
[00:21:08] my shoulder very very wonderful shoulder
[00:21:10] there but shoulders aside it says we
[00:21:13] don't know his favorite character but we
[00:21:14] know it's jean jean jean and then for Z
[00:21:18] we also know it's Sha Sha Sha that's
[00:21:21] right and
[00:21:23] um I will personally say that this time
[00:21:26] as a fellow sh I am I'm rooting for them
[00:21:29] but here on the other side we have uh
[00:21:32] ziko with uh a Catgirl theme going on
[00:21:35] ar60 favorite characters being diona
[00:21:37] Lynette and the one and only Kirara
[00:21:40] which is her cosplay and then we also
[00:21:43] have a fa Master uh favorite characters
[00:21:46] being csing ganu and Nu all the pretty
[00:21:52] ladies and then potentially we will be
[00:21:54] joined by Jake who I believe played
[00:21:57] genin for the first first time yesterday
[00:21:59] fell in love with it unsurprisingly
[00:22:01] fantastic game that we all love of
[00:22:03] course and then they did pop off
[00:22:05] yesterday Jake did a fantastic Jake to
[00:22:08] by the way because we do have another
[00:22:09] Jake on Team One AK Tonto who didn't do
[00:22:13] that well so an ar60 player versus an
[00:22:15] ar1 player you know there is some skill
[00:22:18] issue going on there we will we see a
[00:22:20] repeat of that today I don't know I hope
[00:22:23] not because I would like to see the best
[00:22:25] of the best today now we do have some
[00:22:30] very interesting twists today M and I
[00:22:34] think we can give you a tiny sneak
[00:22:36] preview but today the games are going to
[00:22:38] be chosen by the contestants based on
[00:22:41] how much they're willing to bet
[00:22:44] themselves on the line for these points
[00:22:46] that they gathered yesterday so they are
[00:22:48] going to have a certain amount of points
[00:22:50] that they've bet today in secrecy away
[00:22:53] from each other so team one and team two
[00:22:55] they don't know how many points they
[00:22:56] they put on the line with each other
[00:22:58] yesterday and whoever bet more between
[00:23:00] them will be picking the games and it
[00:23:01] seems like we have picked the game
[00:23:04] charge and clash and the rules
[00:23:07] are yeah so each team will be consisting
[00:23:10] of two members for a total of four
[00:23:12] participants all the players will be
[00:23:14] using C6 saou at the start of the game
[00:23:17] and with a time limit of 5 minutes they
[00:23:19] will be in Dragon spine dodging the
[00:23:22] attacks of the great snowboard King near
[00:23:24] the teleport Waypoint shown below wow
[00:23:27] that that is actually very fun I'm glad
[00:23:30] to see the snowboard King getting some
[00:23:33] love a lot of people didn't believe this
[00:23:36] this enemy or this this monster was real
[00:23:39] when they was introduced into Dragon
[00:23:42] spine I remember my own chat when I was
[00:23:44] streaming Dragon spine I was like you
[00:23:46] know there's a Bor King right like no
[00:23:48] you're lying you're capping but no it's
[00:23:50] it's actually real so we are going to
[00:23:53] set up the Bor King here so this is the
[00:23:55] B King for those of you who have never
[00:23:56] seen it or afraid of of dragon spine
[00:23:59] it's a real boss it's a real boss so
[00:24:01] we're going to see a bunch of sa
[00:24:03] swirling and running around rolling
[00:24:05] around as well trying to avoid the bull
[00:24:08] King mhm it will definitely be a sight I
[00:24:11] don't know about you U but it's been a
[00:24:12] while since I personally Steed foot in
[00:24:14] Dragon spine so it's nice to go back to
[00:24:17] near the start of the game it's like um
[00:24:20] a good walk down memory lane and it's
[00:24:23] been a while since I fought this boss
[00:24:25] and I'm sure it's been a while for our
[00:24:26] contestants as well so let's see if they
[00:24:29] remember the tactics for how this boss
[00:24:31] works I agree Dragon spine is somewhere
[00:24:34] that I personally do avoid I am
[00:24:36] terrified of the sheer cold I get enough
[00:24:38] of that being British and living in the
[00:24:40] UK it's very cold where I come from but
[00:24:42] Dragon spine definitely with the sheer
[00:24:45] cold mechanic I can see why a lot of
[00:24:47] people do like to stray away we did see
[00:24:49] yesterday in the lasora fight that they
[00:24:51] were struggling with the sheer Cod
[00:24:54] mechanic especially team one struggling
[00:24:56] very very hard not able to find those
[00:24:58] butterflies to melt the crystal phase or
[00:25:00] The Shard phase of Lenora for phase one
[00:25:03] so hopefully the sheer Cod is not going
[00:25:05] to absolutely destroy them this time
[00:25:08] around that's true that is something
[00:25:10] that they will have to be fighting
[00:25:11] against as well and oh I think we've had
[00:25:14] a little switch up here and they've
[00:25:16] agreed to go with a bunch of CLE rather
[00:25:19] than a bunch of s I think this is maybe
[00:25:22] because they need to melt things
[00:25:24] potentially but we will see in a moment
[00:25:27] they do have the the totem here to avoid
[00:25:31] she cold and I wonder if if they're
[00:25:35] going to be able to survive because
[00:25:37] maybe the share code will trip away at
[00:25:39] them over here when they enter the arena
[00:25:43] okay so they have gone with CLE to melt
[00:25:45] the the other BS just to start the
[00:25:50] fight we see psycho jumping around we
[00:25:53] see Z Loki kind of cheating because they
[00:25:55] haven't entered the arena Z and tono a
[00:25:59] little bit sussy Behavior here bit of
[00:26:01] bit of silliness here not not entering
[00:26:04] the fight immediately making psycho
[00:26:06] going ahead so the great snow snowbo
[00:26:09] King has arrived the true ruler of
[00:26:12] dragon spine question
[00:26:14] mark I think we've just seen someone
[00:26:17] take a hit here yeah psycho did just
[00:26:19] take a hit there not the greatest amount
[00:26:21] of damage taken and I think the shear
[00:26:26] code is probably going to eliminate
[00:26:27] players
[00:26:29] first they have 4 minutes remaining to
[00:26:32] dodge and I think it's going to be
[00:26:34] absolutely fine for most of them it does
[00:26:36] seem like psycho is being the one
[00:26:37] focused right now targeted by the
[00:26:40] snowball King ooh that was very close
[00:26:42] close Dodge by both
[00:26:46] and very very close and every time the B
[00:26:49] King goes in and charges and dumps into
[00:26:51] a wall he will be stunned for a brief
[00:26:54] moment so dodging this one shouldn't be
[00:26:56] too bad I see two two c maybe three now
[00:26:59] jumping up the tree there I see one in
[00:27:01] Z's camera there standing in a tree a
[00:27:04] little bit of silliness once again but
[00:27:06] we do see the shear cold is ramping up
[00:27:08] now so taking any little bit of damage
[00:27:11] is actually going to cost you oh psycho
[00:27:14] taking a huge hit down to 581 the sh is
[00:27:18] going to eliminate psycho oh no we see
[00:27:21] two CLE in the tree right now fob master
[00:27:24] has also lost some HP already so it's
[00:27:27] looking a little bit I I think it's over
[00:27:30] we see toono at full HP shold is going
[00:27:33] to eliminate him eventually but not
[00:27:35] before fob Master goes down I think this
[00:27:38] game is already over unless somehow
[00:27:41] zionic is able to throw this
[00:27:45] MCH all right F Master down to his final
[00:27:48] 2,000 hit points the sheare code is
[00:27:51] eliminating him slowly but surely Tonto
[00:27:55] just camping up in the tree taking no
[00:27:57] damage at all Z at full HP still or not
[00:28:00] rather full HP but I believe fob has
[00:28:03] been eliminated now and we do see toono
[00:28:06] going down there at the end but they
[00:28:08] have already won zops and Tonto the last
[00:28:11] two alive there well done to team atsu's
[00:28:15] neglected children for winning round one
[00:28:17] although I do want to point out that
[00:28:19] they did join the
[00:28:21] arena a little bit late but on the flip
[00:28:24] side both psycho and fob did actually
[00:28:27] take hits which was the thing that cost
[00:28:30] them in the end not the sh exactly yeah
[00:28:32] well and it looks like the winner for
[00:28:34] this round was U's neglected children
[00:28:37] congratulations congratulations they are
[00:28:39] trying to win the certain atsu's
[00:28:41] attention here and as you can see on the
[00:28:44] screen we have F master and psycho there
[00:28:47] looking absolutely Dapper absolutely
[00:28:49] wonderful they're not phased what soever
[00:28:52] by what just happened they're going to I
[00:28:54] think this time around maybe they might
[00:28:55] partake in a little bit of silliness and
[00:28:57] join the arena a little bit later after
[00:28:59] Toronto and Z you know they' got to have
[00:29:02] a have a codery here a little bit of an
[00:29:05] agreement to to make things a little bit
[00:29:07] more fair so I agree yeah for sure and
[00:29:10] also uh again it is the start of day two
[00:29:13] is still anyone's game I always say this
[00:29:15] but it's not over till it's over until a
[00:29:18] winner has been declared at the end
[00:29:20] really anyone has a chance of winning so
[00:29:23] exactly and a quick reminder that after
[00:29:26] each round we are are going to be doing
[00:29:28] Raffles for those of you watching at
[00:29:30] home online for a potential price of
[00:29:33] these wonderful flip phones so do stay
[00:29:36] tuned so as we load in for the next
[00:29:39] round I took a glance over to the side
[00:29:41] there and they're just making their way
[00:29:43] back over to the Bor King between the
[00:29:45] Bor King that we have today and the geol
[00:29:48] lava that we had yesterday which one
[00:29:50] would you like to be facing in real life
[00:29:53] in real life if they were real enemies
[00:29:55] which one would you want to be taking on
[00:29:58] I mean you know the Bor King is a um is
[00:30:02] technically like a a giant pig right and
[00:30:05] I think pigs are pretty cute uh whereas
[00:30:08] I think if I saw a lava TR like in real
[00:30:10] life I would probably just faint on spot
[00:30:14] I see that's fair enough that's fair
[00:30:15] very very intimidating you know what
[00:30:18] about you LSU oo would you would you
[00:30:21] choose to face the LA Trail to show off
[00:30:24] your true Giga chadness uh I think I
[00:30:26] would go with the lava cha not for the
[00:30:28] Giga chadness I just feel like it would
[00:30:30] be a more painless
[00:30:32] ending for him that's right that's right
[00:30:35] I will eliminate the lava no but on a
[00:30:37] serious note I would definitely go with
[00:30:39] the lavaa I think it would be the faster
[00:30:42] elimination a ball King you know I I
[00:30:44] think I could take on the ball King for
[00:30:46] maybe two minutes maybe you know that's
[00:30:49] true yes yeah I do think that the uh Bor
[00:30:52] Kings attacks are easier to avoid in the
[00:30:54] game as well whereas again as we saw
[00:30:57] yester with the LA TR when that Shield
[00:30:59] is up its attacks are pretty Fierce and
[00:31:02] cover a wide area as well okay seems
[00:31:05] like we are ready to get started very
[00:31:07] very soon we have the four CLE here
[00:31:09] let's see if Z and Tonto will take the
[00:31:11] lead this time it does seem like Z has
[00:31:14] gone ahead what a gentleman what a Gigan
[00:31:16] trying to keep things fair and we can
[00:31:18] see Fish trailing at the end here and I
[00:31:21] believe that's psycho in front of him as
[00:31:23] well so this time once again they do
[00:31:26] have the time limit of of course the
[00:31:28] sheer Cod but it's worth keeping in mind
[00:31:31] the moment you take a singular hit as
[00:31:33] long as nobody else takes a hit you will
[00:31:35] die first to the sheer cold so it is all
[00:31:38] about dodging once again and we see the
[00:31:41] BS appear here I think the enemy or
[00:31:45] rather the B King is focused on oh they
[00:31:48] have targeted psycho here oh but she
[00:31:50] Dodges it dodes very very well very smth
[00:31:54] another huge Dodge there from psycho
[00:31:57] coming through the B King is a very big
[00:31:59] fan of psycho it seems going for Dawn
[00:32:02] two games in a
[00:32:06] row so for those who don't know the Bor
[00:32:09] King when it's not charging it will
[00:32:11] summon its little minions and they oh no
[00:32:15] psycho takes a
[00:32:17] hit oh down to
[00:32:21] 2,199 hit points here but the she cord
[00:32:24] has not hit yet it's still possible for
[00:32:27] her to make a comeback but she has to
[00:32:30] rely her fate is ring on other players
[00:32:34] making a
[00:32:36] mistake well you know when there's
[00:32:39] pressure sometimes people get
[00:32:41] nervous here come the Snowballs we see a
[00:32:44] all from psycho there very interestingly
[00:32:48] enough that's actually quite the
[00:32:50] strategy you can use an elemental burst
[00:32:52] to eye frame and Dodge one of the
[00:32:55] charges I believe psycho is about to
[00:32:57] pass out here because the shear Cod has
[00:33:00] started kicking in within someone's
[00:33:02] camera I I think we're about to see
[00:33:04] someone fade
[00:33:06] away oh there we go psycho is
[00:33:11] down and I think Bob being the last
[00:33:13] person to enter this time will be the
[00:33:16] last alive he is maybe one or two ticks
[00:33:19] behind on the she cold here Tonto as you
[00:33:22] can see is around 1,000 hit points lower
[00:33:25] than Bob right now unless takes a hit
[00:33:27] here he's going to be
[00:33:31] AOK all right here we go to wrap it
[00:33:35] up they're also using the burst to delay
[00:33:38] the last alive is indeed Bob Master
[00:33:41] there zops going down second last and
[00:33:45] Tonto going down second from the start
[00:33:48] so Dawn psycho did go down
[00:33:51] first I think it was a fair trade-off
[00:33:54] and our winner this time is u's fpid
[00:33:58] employees so that is the psycho and fob
[00:34:01] Master team coming through fob taking
[00:34:04] the W as sleepy let's say as sleepy as
[00:34:09] fob Master is right now put in a solid
[00:34:12] performance got all the Dodges off
[00:34:14] psycho despite being targeted actually
[00:34:16] got many many Dodges off very
[00:34:17] unfortunate that the balling kept going
[00:34:19] for her today but maybe we'll see next
[00:34:22] round maybe it will go after Tonto maybe
[00:34:25] we'll go after zos that's hope so I
[00:34:27] would like to see how good their dodging
[00:34:29] abilities are exactly I can never get
[00:34:32] enough of having a good dodging
[00:34:36] demonstration especially from a Shia and
[00:34:39] G main so they don't use zly but Shia
[00:34:45] Mains got to make sure they're very good
[00:34:46] at dodging got to make sure they're
[00:34:48] getting the eye frames up perfectly got
[00:34:50] to make sure they're lamenting properly
[00:34:52] because of course z is no stranger to
[00:34:56] constantly losing hit points slowly
[00:34:58] being chipped away so he should be used
[00:35:00] to the sh mechanic because sh also
[00:35:02] depletes his own hit points as well
[00:35:05] whereas toono not sure about his dodging
[00:35:08] mechanics yeah he's done some C6 Gene
[00:35:10] solos but you can stand there and take a
[00:35:13] lot of hits because you're consistently
[00:35:15] healing so I do want to see how tono's
[00:35:17] dodging mechanics are whether there is a
[00:35:19] skill issue or not we are yet to see
[00:35:22] well we did see yesterday there was a
[00:35:24] skill issue but maybe he's improved
[00:35:25] today in the span of of one night so who
[00:35:28] do you think is going to take the final
[00:35:29] round ooh it's really tough to say I
[00:35:32] want to say that the winners of this
[00:35:34] round will probably start first just to
[00:35:36] keep things balanced um but now that you
[00:35:38] mention it ATU I did realize that you
[00:35:41] know Tanto and Zio both of their Mains
[00:35:44] are animal characters so they're
[00:35:46] basically representing the animal
[00:35:48] element so you guys have to make us
[00:35:50] proud all of our all of us animal lovers
[00:35:53] are are you hearing this they're our
[00:35:55] Representatives all right
[00:35:57] I hope you heard that team atsu's
[00:36:00] neglected children you are representing
[00:36:02] Animo Nation Animo nation is watching
[00:36:05] you guys so do them
[00:36:08] proud and psycho have gone first here
[00:36:12] into the arena we see F master and Z
[00:36:16] trailing at the end here Toronto's
[00:36:18] waiting psycho is in the arena sheer
[00:36:23] cold has started to kick in there
[00:36:24] they're taking their good time getting
[00:36:26] into the arena that build up already I
[00:36:29] think the AG was pulled by either F
[00:36:31] master or Z
[00:36:33] here okay this is going to be
[00:36:35] interesting this is going to be for the
[00:36:37] win for this game we see the fast stun
[00:36:40] coming through nobody has taken any
[00:36:42] damage yet as I can
[00:36:45] see and I think this is going to be a
[00:36:49] fob Master carry I believe oh again okay
[00:36:53] now correct me if I'm wrong Al but it
[00:36:55] looks like because I don't don't play
[00:36:57] CLE a lot I don't know if you do but are
[00:36:59] they uh do c bombs slow the
[00:37:02] enemy I'm not actually certain I am also
[00:37:05] not a clean player so but it looks like
[00:37:09] that uh the downward arrows on the
[00:37:11] boring do show that there's some sort of
[00:37:14] debuff I think that's probably the
[00:37:16] defense down debuff from the
[00:37:17] constellations I believe these are C6
[00:37:19] CLE that's true yes that's right okay so
[00:37:23] we see the shear Co coming through here
[00:37:27] but if no one takes a hit it's just
[00:37:28] going to be whoever entered the arena
[00:37:30] first is going to go down first I see Z
[00:37:33] picking up the mint there little good
[00:37:36] luck
[00:37:37] charm are we going to see anybody take a
[00:37:40] hit here they have had two rounds to
[00:37:42] adjust already to get used to the
[00:37:44] movements and attacks of the Bor King so
[00:37:47] we might not see anyone go down here
[00:37:49] from a b king
[00:37:51] attack all right they're all staying in
[00:37:54] like a hi Mind Group all staying get a
[00:37:57] big Club a Big Blob of red this peak C6
[00:38:00] ple gaml everyone you are witnessing on
[00:38:03] the screen right now all right we see
[00:38:06] the sheer C ticking away everyone's
[00:38:08] under 50% hit points here I don't think
[00:38:11] we will be able to tell who goes down
[00:38:13] first here it's going to be really
[00:38:15] really close I believe it will be very
[00:38:17] very
[00:38:19] close Okay so between twano and psycho I
[00:38:22] believe psycho is going to go down one
[00:38:24] tick first theno side goes down oh TW
[00:38:28] using the elemental bur to lay his down
[00:38:31] what a smart move the strategy the big
[00:38:35] strategy okay we did not see when fob
[00:38:38] master and Z went down I assume around
[00:38:41] the same time I think psycho used her
[00:38:43] Elemental burst slightly early and at
[00:38:46] the same time while you're using your
[00:38:47] Elemental burst your hit points are
[00:38:49] still ticking down you will still take
[00:38:51] damage as soon as you come out of that
[00:38:53] Elemental burst so the best time to use
[00:38:55] it is just as you're about to die so you
[00:38:57] can buy those extra seconds I'm pretty
[00:39:00] sure Tanto made that play there which is
[00:39:02] going to be quite huge potentially he
[00:39:04] was the last to die there I did not know
[00:39:06] I we do not know for sure whether or not
[00:39:08] fob master or zy also did the elemental
[00:39:11] burst play so we'll see in a moment when
[00:39:14] the winner appears at the that the
[00:39:16] winners are actually uh U's neglected
[00:39:19] children so that did make the difference
[00:39:23] big play from Toronto coming through
[00:39:25] round of applause Animo Nation there
[00:39:28] well proud I don't I don't know maybe
[00:39:32] maybe it was me rousing them up you know
[00:39:34] mentioning animal their favorite
[00:39:36] characters maybe they get um energy when
[00:39:38] they think of their
[00:39:40] Mains sorry like anime right yeah that's
[00:39:44] an anime thing right power of Animo
[00:39:46] rather than the power of friendship
[00:39:48] coming through this time so we do have
[00:39:51] the team at sus I I you know I always
[00:39:55] have to stutter and think do I really
[00:39:56] want to say these team names every time
[00:39:58] but team atsu's neglected children are
[00:40:01] in the lead for today however they are
[00:40:04] still trailing a lot from the Boss Rush
[00:40:06] yesterday compared to teamu they are
[00:40:11] employ make up their points and gain
[00:40:15] back some
[00:40:16] ground but beforehand they did place
[00:40:19] bets using their points on who would win
[00:40:22] and if they win they get to double the
[00:40:24] points that they bet so here we go we
[00:40:27] have team zionic and Tonto here zionic
[00:40:30] give us a
[00:40:32] wave ah wow wow zionic look behind you
[00:40:37] at the
[00:40:38] screen you're on camera and he's no
[00:40:41] longer on camera back to us okay so we
[00:40:44] have the points now oh it's it's tied up
[00:40:46] to 1,45 to
[00:40:49] 1,45 I believe TI I believe it's because
[00:40:53] the neglected children bet the right
[00:40:55] amount of points to tie are the points
[00:40:57] so we're 1,45 to
[00:40:59] 1,45 so that is going to be very very
[00:41:02] interesting unless that is a negative
[00:41:05] 1,45 I'm seeing there but we will get a
[00:41:07] confirmation on that in a moment but yes
[00:41:10] they are tied up for today and game two
[00:41:14] we are still deciding I think the the
[00:41:16] winners are deciding what game they want
[00:41:18] to play I do see but if the winnings are
[00:41:21] tied then who gets to
[00:41:23] choose I think the winner of the last
[00:41:25] round
[00:41:27] children the next so we will let you
[00:41:30] know who what game we will have in a
[00:41:33] moment and I believe we also are going
[00:41:35] to start doing the raffle soon so make
[00:41:38] sure you are in
[00:41:40] twitch.tv/ ASR Carnival once again that
[00:41:42] is a s r a c a r n i v a l so
[00:41:48] twitch.tv/ asra Carnival and I will let
[00:41:51] you guys know when the raffle is ready
[00:41:53] and once again you will be able to win
[00:41:54] some OnePlus goodies including possibly
[00:41:57] this very very beautiful OnePlus 5G 11
[00:42:01] phone so that's going to be exciting
[00:42:04] exactly so AA do you have a favorite
[00:42:07] mini game of the ones that we've seen
[00:42:10] like yesterday and throughout the whole
[00:42:13] uh Carnival if you were a participant
[00:42:16] which game do you think you'd be like
[00:42:19] the best at a sure winner the boss
[00:42:23] Russia side for the mini games I would
[00:42:26] personally go with the lava tra one oh
[00:42:30] okay so lining up with your previous
[00:42:32] question that you asked me yep yep I I I
[00:42:35] have a fair amount of experience with
[00:42:36] the lava charm mini game so I think I'd
[00:42:39] be able to put in a fair sh I like the
[00:42:40] racing one as well I think I'm very good
[00:42:42] at taking the quick corners and cutting
[00:42:44] the quick corners for the sa racing as
[00:42:46] well so that one is something I'd like
[00:42:48] to do the maze one though I know I was
[00:42:51] roasting them yesterday but I I don't
[00:42:53] think I do very good in the the serener
[00:42:55] teapot maze competition o what about you
[00:42:59] H yeah I think the maze is definitely
[00:43:01] the most difficult especially with
[00:43:03] everything looking so similar I think
[00:43:06] personally I would like the racing one
[00:43:09] the most I don't know just something
[00:43:11] about a race that really gets your like
[00:43:13] blood racing
[00:43:17] literally and then the lavro one I think
[00:43:20] with any enemy uh once you practice
[00:43:24] enough then you'll be able to get the
[00:43:26] attack patterns down but for me I'm just
[00:43:29] yeah I definitely have a skill issue
[00:43:30] with toring and speaking of racing we
[00:43:34] have the return of Fufu win Wheel racing
[00:43:37] for those of you who missed it yesterday
[00:43:39] this was our very first mini game where
[00:43:42] everyone is going to play with a saou
[00:43:45] it's going to be a C6 saou and they have
[00:43:47] to race within the confines of this
[00:43:49] region this area that you see on the map
[00:43:51] on the right hand side of your screen
[00:43:53] and they have to go all the way from the
[00:43:54] starting point to the final checkpoint
[00:43:57] which is going to be the seats
[00:44:01] in I don't know what the
[00:44:04] isod Pavilion I think Pavilion yeah so
[00:44:07] as you can see they're going to race all
[00:44:09] the way through chinka Village and they
[00:44:11] are going to end in the Pavilion and the
[00:44:13] first people to sit down are going to
[00:44:16] win or rather you they're going to get
[00:44:17] different amount of points assigned to
[00:44:19] them based on the rank here first second
[00:44:21] third and fourth do you remember who won
[00:44:24] yesterday oh a blur to be honest like
[00:44:29] literally like look how fast well I
[00:44:31] guess this footage is sped up it's a
[00:44:33] demonstration of the uh track the
[00:44:35] pathway and they have to stay and on
[00:44:38] this course they cannot go off course if
[00:44:39] they go off course here they will be
[00:44:41] eliminated but it is a very very
[00:44:43] straightforward path that they have to
[00:44:44] go through and we're about to see where
[00:44:46] the finish line is right here so the
[00:44:48] first people to sit down you want to be
[00:44:50] first you want to be second take all of
[00:44:52] those points and push down the enemy
[00:44:55] team that's right that's right yeah I I
[00:44:58] don't know I was just thinking actually
[00:45:00] ATU I've never seen a Finish Line in a
[00:45:02] race that's chairs have
[00:45:05] you I don't think so either so this is
[00:45:08] the first as well so we are loaded into
[00:45:11] the game and we are going to count you
[00:45:13] down very very
[00:45:16] soon oh sa is so cute look at is very
[00:45:19] adorable blue ears 3 2 1 go go go and we
[00:45:25] see B Master with a big jump at the
[00:45:28] beginning taking the lead but it is a
[00:45:31] small lead looks like everyone is
[00:45:34] basically neck and neck they're like
[00:45:36] neck and neck for a lot of people here
[00:45:38] traveling in a they're like a trio look
[00:45:40] at them go they are a big mob right now
[00:45:43] as you can see F Master Z Tonto psycho
[00:45:48] they're all fighting and spinning to win
[00:45:51] mhm that's right I was about to say when
[00:45:52] they were in that little triangle
[00:45:54] formation they kind of remind me of the
[00:45:55] Power Puff
[00:45:58] Girl that's very adorable right so it's
[00:46:01] very important that they cut the corners
[00:46:03] here and take the inside course as much
[00:46:05] as possible and they know when to switch
[00:46:08] over from left to right hand side to
[00:46:10] make the even the most tiniest fractions
[00:46:13] of cutting Corners is going to decide
[00:46:16] whether or not you win yesterday we did
[00:46:17] see a zionic skill issue I believe F
[00:46:20] Master is going to sit down first on
[00:46:22] this oh actually no F Master is last to
[00:46:24] sit down he doesn't even know whether
[00:46:26] what a turn of event that was very neck
[00:46:29] and neck I was trying to look at all
[00:46:30] four cameras at the same time I believe
[00:46:32] it was either Z or psycho that sat down
[00:46:35] first there but all I can say for sure
[00:46:38] is that fob master came last and he
[00:46:41] didn't even know where to sit down sorry
[00:46:43] the tables were turn and give it up for
[00:46:47] U's oh they're not looking very
[00:46:49] impressed right now fob fob is not
[00:46:52] looking he's looking a little bit
[00:46:53] confused right now psycho thinking oh oh
[00:46:57] brother what am I doing what is this guy
[00:46:59] doing what what do I have to carry here
[00:47:01] she has a very very very big job today
[00:47:04] because clearly fob Master is not
[00:47:06] carrying his weight how unfortunate
[00:47:09] maybe she's thinking oh he's weighing me
[00:47:11] down how do I how do I get rid no I'm
[00:47:13] kidding that's that's very that's too
[00:47:14] mean to say wow can we cut that out
[00:47:18] please wow so we see I I believe we
[00:47:22] haven't seen the winners yet I think
[00:47:23] they're still calculating they're doing
[00:47:25] a for those those of you who watch
[00:47:26] football As Americans like to call it
[00:47:28] Sako we're doing a v check video
[00:47:31] assistant referee check to see who came
[00:47:34] first there cuz it was very very much
[00:47:36] neck and neck I do think though that it
[00:47:39] was definitely between psycho or zionic
[00:47:42] that came first they are loading into
[00:47:44] the second race now as well the one
[00:47:47] thing that was very clear though is fun
[00:47:49] Master most definitely came last so it
[00:47:52] was a pretty big big lead he had he had
[00:47:55] a small lead at the beginning and then
[00:47:57] at the end it just I I don't know what
[00:47:59] Happ not sure what happened but he lost
[00:48:01] it to to throw away a lead like that
[00:48:04] embarrassing it just goes to show again
[00:48:06] it's not over till it's over exactly it
[00:48:09] is not over until it is over all right
[00:48:12] we are loaded into the next race and we
[00:48:15] will count you guys down very very soon
[00:48:17] Z's trying to be a little bit cheeky
[00:48:19] there get a bit of a head start but is
[00:48:22] he is he trying to give himself a debuff
[00:48:24] here bit of a hand
[00:48:26] all right the race begins now go go go
[00:48:30] and I believe if we take a look at the
[00:48:33] tto psycho F Master cameras everyone is
[00:48:36] first on their own camera do bear in
[00:48:39] mind in Co-op it does seem like to your
[00:48:42] to your own camera that you you might be
[00:48:44] first but when it gets to the end point
[00:48:46] we will see very clearly who is in the
[00:48:49] lead now it does seem like toono is
[00:48:51] actually in the lead on everyone's
[00:48:52] camera
[00:48:53] now I don't see any one in front of
[00:48:56] Tanto here psycho also as well oh it
[00:48:58] seems like psycho tono probably neck and
[00:49:00] neck yeah
[00:49:03] SC okay oh Tanto has been passed by
[00:49:07] someone on his own camera I believe that
[00:49:09] is psycho F Master once again trailing
[00:49:11] oh no rather Z and z and fob are
[00:49:14] trailing here so it's between psycho and
[00:49:16] Tanto this time kind of oh that was a
[00:49:19] good turn there from psycho some
[00:49:21] excellent rolling here and I
[00:49:23] believe and
[00:49:26] again TW and
[00:49:28] pyo neck and neck there Z third and
[00:49:33] unsurprisingly the fbit
[00:49:36] master master of none rolling into last
[00:49:41] place a second time give it up for 's
[00:49:44] neglected children Soto I believe with
[00:49:48] the V check that we had did come first
[00:49:51] by a millisecond there just the most
[00:49:54] marginal marginal difference there so
[00:49:56] Tanto actually doing a lot of heavy
[00:49:58] lifting today lot of lot of carrying a
[00:50:01] lot of great performance coming in from
[00:50:02] toono redeeming himself for some
[00:50:05] questionable performances yesterday F
[00:50:07] Master looked a little bit stronger
[00:50:08] yesterday not sure what's happened but
[00:50:10] he is looking like an absolute disaster
[00:50:12] absolute
[00:50:13] mess I don't know what's going on maybe
[00:50:16] maybe they got overconfident you know
[00:50:18] maybe they did maybe they did psycho
[00:50:20] pulling a lot of weight right now and
[00:50:23] zionic putting in a rather a aage humble
[00:50:26] performance let's say humble maybe he
[00:50:28] just doesn't want to show everyone up
[00:50:30] with how amazing tall handsome
[00:50:32] intelligent his zionic game play is he
[00:50:35] is trying to refrain from lamenting too
[00:50:38] hard on the opposition because clearly
[00:50:41] fob is not up to par today not putting
[00:50:43] in the best performance that he can so
[00:50:45] maybe he just wants to even the even the
[00:50:47] scores a little bit try and give a
[00:50:48] little bit of a handy cap for a more
[00:50:50] fair game or maybe he's saving it for
[00:50:53] when it matters near the
[00:50:56] to redeem himself for the Boss Rush
[00:50:57] because yesterday he was on noet and did
[00:51:01] get eliminated which did cost them for
[00:51:04] the Boss Rush so maybe he's preparing
[00:51:07] himself for that we see tono typing
[00:51:10] something in the chat right
[00:51:13] now all right start here we go go go
[00:51:19] go oh my gosh I'm so sorry is it is it
[00:51:23] Psy psycho yes I know why when I see her
[00:51:26] name I think SEO it's okay she she's
[00:51:28] okay with both SEO and psycho B Master
[00:51:31] opening the menu there by accident oh no
[00:51:35] what is this guy
[00:51:37] doing all right we see I believe Z is in
[00:51:40] the lead here psyo is also in the lead
[00:51:43] on their own cameras they are all in the
[00:51:45] lead Tonto also in the lead F Master
[00:51:48] trailing okay so we go around the corner
[00:51:50] here I believe the first person to go
[00:51:52] around the corner here was Psycho psycho
[00:51:55] looks like she is going to go through
[00:51:57] the archway here first she is in the
[00:51:59] lead here can Tonto catch up all right
[00:52:04] psycho is the first across the bridge as
[00:52:06] well you see in the middle right ooh
[00:52:10] who's going to sit down first I think
[00:52:12] psycho was the first one then maybe TW
[00:52:15] actually once
[00:52:17] again I think it was tto that that got
[00:52:21] down first I I do think it was him I did
[00:52:23] see that got to give credit where credit
[00:52:26] is due all right so once again twon and
[00:52:29] psycho doing all the heavy lifting for
[00:52:31] both of their teams not really sure
[00:52:33] what's going on with the fun master and
[00:52:35] zionic performances today we do see the
[00:52:37] winner is atsu's neglected children
[00:52:40] they're dapping each other up the animal
[00:52:43] Brotherhood and speaking of animal is
[00:52:46] that an a shell mask on
[00:52:49] ZX it is we see some sh clothing there
[00:52:54] for Mr zionic repping team Animo repping
[00:52:58] team lament so once again ATU neglected
[00:53:01] children also take game
[00:53:04] two very welld deserved would would you
[00:53:06] say that was welld deserved
[00:53:08] auu I feel like it's a 2v one right
[00:53:12] now I I do feel like it's a 2v one who
[00:53:15] is the the missing player
[00:53:19] wow F master I think is just F you know
[00:53:23] just F in the chat he he's he's he's
[00:53:26] gone you know I think I'm hanging out
[00:53:29] with you too much because when you were
[00:53:30] saying earlier um talking about fa I was
[00:53:33] like I wanted to say oh um cuz you were
[00:53:38] saying he's the master and I was like oh
[00:53:40] like what does the f stand for f stands
[00:53:43] for
[00:53:45] failure
[00:53:47] wow I believe F actually stands for
[00:53:49] fresh oh but definitely not looking
[00:53:53] fresh today master not today hey
[00:53:56] everyone has their good days and their
[00:53:58] bad days though you know exactly maybe
[00:54:01] he's just you know because they
[00:54:03] obliterated the opposition yesterday
[00:54:06] maybe fb's just acting and at the end
[00:54:10] where it matters the most in the Boss
[00:54:12] Rush he's going to show his true
[00:54:15] potential ex yeah maybe everyone is just
[00:54:17] banking their efforts for when it counts
[00:54:20] the most because all it really takes is
[00:54:23] one maybe two additional bosses is and
[00:54:25] then the point gap is going to
[00:54:27] absolutely store the disparity we saw
[00:54:30] yesterday was absolutely huge I believe
[00:54:33] team at's unplayed employees had was it
[00:54:36] two extra bosses that they were able to
[00:54:38] complete I think it was like it was one
[00:54:40] and then they were like or like they
[00:54:41] were halfway through signora two and a
[00:54:43] half I think or so so we see ATU
[00:54:46] neglected children winning 725 points
[00:54:49] there and supposedly zero points for
[00:54:51] as's unpaid employees or rather I think
[00:54:54] that was actually a negative 1,45 on
[00:54:57] round one and they craw their way back
[00:54:59] to zero points so we we'll see how
[00:55:02] what's going on there and we'll get you
[00:55:04] guys a clearer understanding of what's
[00:55:06] happening with the points right now but
[00:55:08] we do still see that anu's neglected
[00:55:10] children are very much in the lead right
[00:55:13] now we have two more mini games in store
[00:55:16] as well and the next game is going to be
[00:55:19] a survival challenge I believe this
[00:55:22] might be the lava tra game mhm I think
[00:55:24] so oh
[00:55:26] yeah it's going to be very very very
[00:55:28] exciting to see how the contestants are
[00:55:32] going to fair this time hopefully they
[00:55:34] have learned some skills this time
[00:55:37] yesterday was actually very competitive
[00:55:39] the first match was a tie second one I
[00:55:42] believe went to the neglected children
[00:55:44] and the third one went
[00:55:46] to the other team I believe so it was
[00:55:49] very very neck and neck
[00:55:50] yesterday speaking of La trolls again
[00:55:53] ATU so we saw in the mini game that we
[00:55:56] are fighting the or our contestants were
[00:55:58] facing off against the geol lava tra but
[00:56:03] is the GE lava trol your favorite if you
[00:56:05] had to choose a
[00:56:07] favorite which lav do you think is the
[00:56:09] is your favorite or the worst I like the
[00:56:11] Geo lava CH I think Gio lava does have
[00:56:14] anything to do with zong I love Gio I'm
[00:56:17] a Geo shrim so Geo lava Chow that's the
[00:56:20] one I go with all the lava chells look
[00:56:22] cool
[00:56:23] though I'm a big fan of all of that what
[00:56:25] about you I don't know I I think the
[00:56:28] Electra one is extremely annoying
[00:56:30] Electra one is extremely annoying yeah
[00:56:33] but also looks cool that's true that's
[00:56:36] true I'm wondering if maybe we'll see
[00:56:37] like you know like a a a dendral la TR
[00:56:41] would that be a thing that would be
[00:56:43] bizarre or a pyro La we don't have a
[00:56:47] pyro La TR in the game that would also
[00:56:49] be bizarre but I'm down for all of those
[00:56:51] lava
[00:56:52] CHS we have the electro we have we have
[00:56:55] the cryo and we have the Geo yes and we
[00:56:57] also don't have hydro hydro would also
[00:56:59] be pretty cool all the lava chars look
[00:57:01] very cool they are all very powerful
[00:57:04] very annoying enemies to deal with
[00:57:06] unless you have zong
[00:57:08] Le pull for zong Le guys zongi will
[00:57:11] solve all your problems in real life in
[00:57:15] and life what what real life problems is
[00:57:18] is he solving
[00:57:21] loneliness I see Z is the truth is the
[00:57:25] way okay so I am just taking a glance
[00:57:28] over there and I do believe we are going
[00:57:30] to the geol lava CH indeed and they are
[00:57:33] all going to be playing with the geot
[00:57:35] traveler they can use their abilities
[00:57:37] and Elemental burst to delay or block
[00:57:40] attacks from the geol lava Chell however
[00:57:42] they are not allowed to eliminate the
[00:57:43] geol lava now one of the strategies that
[00:57:45] is very popular when taking on the geol
[00:57:47] lava Chell is to just try and break that
[00:57:49] Geo shield on the lava Chell as soon as
[00:57:51] possible because as or rather when The
[00:57:53] Shield is on the gva Chell you have the
[00:57:56] stronger heavy attacks coming through
[00:57:58] from the geol lava Chell so I don't know
[00:58:00] if you guys were able to hear the no no
[00:58:02] no NOS coming from my right hand side
[00:58:03] here but I think zionic and tono
[00:58:06] accidentally started the contest and
[00:58:08] gained the aggression of the lava TR so
[00:58:10] they all had to teleport out and
[00:58:12] teleporting back in so sorry slight
[00:58:14] technical issue or rather skill issue
[00:58:16] that's holding us from starting on they
[00:58:18] are going to teleport back in here he's
[00:58:20] just eyeing me down zionic is just
[00:58:22] eyeing me down the reason why I'm
[00:58:23] looking down is cuz he's so though so
[00:58:26] yeah so we'll we'll get started soon
[00:58:28] Chop Chop boys Chop Chop get back into
[00:58:31] the game but as I was saying when you
[00:58:34] have the Geo shield on the lava does all
[00:58:36] the heavy attacks all the area of effect
[00:58:38] attacks which is what eliminated
[00:58:40] everyone yesterday but when The Shield
[00:58:42] is off it's actually very easy to
[00:58:44] predict the movements of the enemy
[00:58:46] that's right and unlike with the CLE
[00:58:48] challenge facing off against the Bor
[00:58:50] King uh so for Cle she has a longer
[00:58:54] burst animation because she is a five
[00:58:56] star whereas with the geot traveler we
[00:58:58] don't really have that so it's a harder
[00:59:00] to dodge with the burst on the geot
[00:59:02] traveler too indeed so we do have news
[00:59:05] some very exciting news we are going to
[00:59:07] start the raffle soon and the way the

[01:01:38] shortly someone will contact you as well
[01:01:41] to how to claim the prize as well so I
[01:01:45] think the raffle is probably going to
[01:01:46] wrap up soonish as we load the players
[01:01:49] into the game so give us a moment to do
[01:01:52] that I see one if I look over his screen
[01:01:56] he's just looking at
[01:01:58] Jean he has he has Jean's menu open and
[01:02:01] he's just staring at Jean so here we go
[01:02:04] here are the rules yeah so we do have
[01:02:06] again the survival challenge so all
[01:02:09] players will be using the same G uh C6
[01:02:13] geot traveler without any equipment to
[01:02:15] start the challenge and this will be in
[01:02:17] the bishu plains in leeway all the
[01:02:20] players need to try to avoid the lava
[01:02:22] troll attacks uh and they have a the
[01:02:24] time limit of 5 minutes to survive and
[01:02:26] again they cannot they can attack the LA
[01:02:29] trol to get rid of The Shield but they
[01:02:31] can't kill it and it's really just a
[01:02:36] battle for survival a war of attrition
[01:02:39] yes exactly and they they do have to
[01:02:41] stay in that ring that the lava cha is
[01:02:43] in as well they can't like run away and
[01:02:45] just hide in a corner while someone gets
[01:02:47] chased around over and over again they
[01:02:49] all have to be in that ring that you're
[01:02:51] about to see here in a moment I wonder
[01:02:53] if we'll see
[01:02:54] tree climbing yeah we see the lava CH
[01:02:57] like grumpy walking back to the starting
[01:02:59] point
[01:03:02] here okay so this is I believe a
[01:03:04] demonstration of the area so that
[01:03:06] circular arena is the Battle Zone so you
[01:03:09] are not allowed to leave that area I
[01:03:11] think you can climb up the trees but the
[01:03:14] lava CH can actually hit you in the
[01:03:15] trees with the slam dunk attack and also
[01:03:18] the The Rock SL the Geo slim throw as
[01:03:21] well so stay in the tree not NE the best
[01:03:24] strategy I've learned that in the past
[01:03:26] the hard way and it did cost me dearly
[01:03:28] so so yeah let's see if anyone tries to
[01:03:31] implement that do you remember the first
[01:03:33] time that you fought this lava Trail U
[01:03:36] because I feel like this uh you know

[01:04:03] receive a whisper sometimes with twitch
[01:04:06] The Whispers when you open and close
[01:04:08] them it takes a while to load so it
[01:04:10] might take a little bit over 24 to 48
[01:04:12] hours to receive your message on how to
[01:04:14] receive the prizes as well so we have
[01:04:18] loaded in I do see if I look over to my
[01:04:20] right hand side we have zionic staring
[01:04:23] at sh and we have tono staring at Jean
[01:04:27] right now so we are getting ready to
[01:04:29] start the competition and I think this
[01:04:32] time around I want to see a strong
[01:04:34] showing from fob Master this is FOB
[01:04:36] Master's Forte this is home territory he
[01:04:39] has a lot of experience yeah his chance
[01:04:41] to redeem himself he has a lot of
[01:04:43] experience for the lava child
[01:04:46] Showdown doing a bit of shuffling there
[01:04:49] now for those of us out of the loop U
[01:04:51] why why do you say that fob is such a
[01:04:53] good good uh has a lot of experience
[01:04:56] with this type of mini game is does he
[01:04:59] not have zong Le does he Pride himself
[01:05:01] on his dodging skill in abys or so for
[01:05:05] those of you that don't know we are
[01:05:07] currently doing these competitions and
[01:05:09] shows these wonderful streams courtesy
[01:05:11] of Astra Carnival now Astra Carnival
[01:05:13] host many of these have I been lucky
[01:05:15] enough to be on a competition in the
[01:05:16] past with fob as well at Gamescom and
[01:05:19] fob and I had to do this challenge as
[01:05:22] well and fob was the one that actually
[01:05:24] came up with the strategy of climbing
[01:05:25] the tree and you know trying to be
[01:05:27] cheeky with all the slow strategy
[01:05:29] walking around and we did have that face
[01:05:32] off multiple times we did so many rounds
[01:05:34] of surviving the lava child back then
[01:05:37] though we weren't allowed to use ability
[01:05:38] so it's just pure dodging ability and
[01:05:41] once you Agro the monster it would stay
[01:05:43] on that same person until they died but
[01:05:46] this time around everyone is using their
[01:05:48] ability so the aggros keep switching so
[01:05:50] you have less control over where the
[01:05:51] lava Chell is going to jump and attack
[01:05:54] so we are going to take a bit of a break
[01:05:57] an emergency has appeared so apologies
[01:06:01] for that but we will be returning with
[01:06:03] you guys hopefully shortly so do bear in
[01:06:06] mind we will be back with more prizes as
[01:06:09] well so do stay tuned stay tuned stay

[01:13:04] wonderful OnePlus phones thank you to
[01:13:06] OnePlus for sponsoring today's event so
[01:13:09] while we load up into the geol lava Cho
[01:13:12] challenge a reminder for those of you
[01:13:13] who are tuning in now that our teams are
[01:13:15] for team Animo I'm going to call them
[01:13:17] team Animo now because I'm tired of
[01:13:19] their actual name team ano is consistent
[01:13:22] of Zio and
[01:13:26] Tonto and then on the other team we have
[01:13:30] H I don't think they I think we have to
[01:13:32] use the actual team name for this they
[01:13:34] are U's unpaid
[01:13:36] employees uh and SEO and F Master are
[01:13:41] representing boo
[01:13:43] boo boo so the next game is going to be
[01:13:47] the Geo lava CH survival challenge the
[01:13:50] one in lierra I'm sure you guys all know
[01:13:52] it's very iconic it's right right by a
[01:13:53] Teleport Waypoint and it's in like a
[01:13:55] circular Arena they are going to have to
[01:13:57] stay in the circular arena with a C6 Geo
[01:14:00] traveler with no gear no equipment no
[01:14:03] weapons no artifacts none of that
[01:14:04] nonsense they are going to be here as
[01:14:06] you can see on the screen and they are
[01:14:08] going to have to try and survive for as
[01:14:10] long as possible of course if you are
[01:14:12] the last to die or if you don't die at
[01:14:14] all you're going to win the maximum
[01:14:15] points so it's going to go down in first
[01:14:17] place second place third place fourth
[01:14:19] place and how long you can survive so
[01:14:22] the Geo Shield is placed onto the lava
[01:14:24] charm meaning all the hard heavy hitting
[01:14:27] attacks with AOE are going to be dropped
[01:14:29] here the ones where rocks shatter out
[01:14:31] from the ground or spikes come out from
[01:14:33] the ground right here with a slam dunk o
[01:14:36] o eliminating all of the all of them
[01:14:39] yeah one move so no one has lost any hit
[01:14:43] points yet but it is scary when the Geo
[01:14:45] Shield is on they can use the elemental
[01:14:47] skills and Elemental burst to chip away
[01:14:49] at the hit point of the lava child to
[01:14:52] make it stop doing all of these heavy
[01:14:54] AOE attacks however you know some people
[01:14:58] might argue the the ones who are more
[01:15:00] confident might argue it's better to
[01:15:02] keep the shield on for as long as
[01:15:03] possible because I'm good enough to
[01:15:06] dodge all of these abilities oh we see
[01:15:08] someone taking a hit there I believe it
[01:15:11] was either psycho or zionic there taking
[01:15:14] the hit there did they get eliminated
[01:15:16] just now
[01:15:18] no I see four travel on the screen so
[01:15:21] they are still alive ooh we see F Master
[01:15:24] jumping from geoc contract to geoc
[01:15:26] construct gliding oh the geoc contract
[01:15:29] breaks just now but I think everyone is
[01:15:31] still healthy on the one player who has
[01:15:34] lost a fair amount of hit points we will
[01:15:35] switch to that POV in a moment we'll
[01:15:38] switch over to the camera in a moment
[01:15:41] and I I'm thinking that it's maybe
[01:15:43] psycho that's taken the damage here oh
[01:15:46] no it definitely zionic who has taken
[01:15:49] the damage here oh look at him running
[01:15:53] they're all just chilling
[01:15:55] now chilling on the geoc
[01:15:59] construct so as you can see without the
[01:16:02] Geo shield on the lava CH there's okay
[01:16:05] as I was saying the Geo Shield is back
[01:16:08] on the lava so we are going to have the
[01:16:10] heavy attacks coming back
[01:16:13] through there is 3 minutes left on the
[01:16:16] clock for our
[01:16:17] contestant we have the ground pounds
[01:16:20] coming out I think someone actually just
[01:16:22] got hit there unless it was damage on
[01:16:24] the GE
[01:16:25] construct oh fob master has taken damage
[01:16:28] down 6,400 hit points with a huge Dodge
[01:16:32] there very very confident
[01:16:35] wow perfect eye frame just as the lavaa
[01:16:38] was about to slam dug on him I think
[01:16:41] he's flexing he it's like you said he
[01:16:44] you he knows he's got this having said
[01:16:46] that he is losing right
[01:16:48] now oh Tanto taking a hit there from the
[01:16:51] slam dunk also down to
[01:16:54] 6,454 HP so both of them got hit by the
[01:16:57] same ability they still have 2 minutes
[01:16:59] and 20 seconds though so there's still
[01:17:02] plenty of time to
[01:17:04] survive ter smash it looks like the new
[01:17:08] tack is standing on the geoc construct
[01:17:11] and just chilling until the lava troll
[01:17:12] comes to you or until the construct
[01:17:17] breaks all right we still see fob Master
[01:17:20] jumping around think is he going to try
[01:17:23] to face the L head
[01:17:26] on has zionic faded away I only see
[01:17:30] three Trav been a while since I only see
[01:17:32] three oh no no was that a
[01:17:36] four oh I think there is one person
[01:17:38] behind the lava tra we did see some of
[01:17:41] that gamep playay yesterday there is yes
[01:17:43] there is hiding behind the geoc
[01:17:45] constructs there so everyone is still
[01:17:47] alive the Geo the Geo Shield is back on
[01:17:51] so we are going to have the big hits the
[01:17:53] big attacks coming through here well
[01:17:54] this is the last stretch we have one B
[01:17:57] Master goes down spoke too soon oh no oh
[01:18:02] the geol is going ham with the slam
[01:18:04] duner but fob Master is the first to go
[01:18:08] down down down how unfortunate trying to
[01:18:12] flex once again biting him back Z down
[01:18:16] in red B oh zionic is down as well it's
[01:18:19] it's down to the two T's yeah again once
[01:18:23] again down to the two
[01:18:25] T's minut to spare and they're both
[01:18:29] chasing one after the other they both on
[01:18:31] the same side they're challenging each
[01:18:33] other to a One V one DOD cont oh psyo
[01:18:36] take a hit here down to
[01:18:38] 4,244 hit points Toronto in the
[01:18:41] ascendancy however both of these players
[01:18:43] are still alive there's only 30 seconds
[01:18:45] left the Geo Shield is about to break
[01:18:48] here oh we see some ground oh psycho
[01:18:51] goes down that's what is the winner with
[01:18:54] around 30 seconds remaining that's right
[01:18:58] congratulations to Tonto putting in an
[01:19:01] excellent performance today I believe
[01:19:03] tono has been winning most of the rounds
[01:19:05] today really really really strong
[01:19:07] performance coming through from Tonto
[01:19:09] congratulations to atsu's neglected
[01:19:11] children he just wants to make you proud
[01:19:14] you know I guess he is trying to make me
[01:19:15] proud I did give him a good grilling and
[01:19:18] roasting yesterday he did get cooked oh
[01:19:21] that discipline he get disciplined he
[01:19:23] did get cooked so hopefully we're going
[01:19:26] to see well maybe I need to cook zionic
[01:19:29] because his performances have not been
[01:19:30] great maybe I need to cook fob because
[01:19:33] he's been he's been awful today
[01:19:35] absolutely terrible he was trying to
[01:19:37] flex despite being the worst performer
[01:19:40] today he thought he could get away with
[01:19:41] flexing in that round I have no idea
[01:19:43] what this guy is thinking what is going
[01:19:45] through his head if anything's going
[01:19:47] through his head at all but he tried to
[01:19:49] flex it backfired again because he tried
[01:19:51] to do that yesterday add it back fired
[01:19:54] you know what they say uh insanity is uh
[01:19:57] doing the same thing over and over again
[01:19:58] and expecting true a different result
[01:20:01] true so fun
[01:20:03] Master
[01:20:04] insane not in the great way apparently
[01:20:08] thank you waiting
[01:20:10] for yo hearing all these comments that
[01:20:12] you're making about about all the
[01:20:14] contestants on stage I'm like I'm glad

[01:21:01] work toono very lucky there not to have
[01:21:03] been hit I down to luck and not
[01:21:06] skill I mean a bit of luck is important
[01:21:09] every now and then that's true that's
[01:21:12] true to seems to be challenging the
[01:21:14] laral head on moving out of the range of
[01:21:17] the AOE attack putting that geoc
[01:21:19] construct down oh what an high frame
[01:21:22] again tono flexing the dodging moves

[01:25:34] so team atsu's unpaid employees looking
[01:25:37] kind of strong here first match though
[01:25:40] was taken by ATU neglected children so
[01:25:43] it is one to one right
[01:25:45] now oh it looks like f and
[01:25:48] uh I think that's F and Tanto hiding
[01:25:51] behind the tree right now this uh tree
[01:25:53] teack is really interesting it is very
[01:25:55] interesting I'm not sure how effective
[01:25:57] that
[01:25:58] ISO on full HP does seem like the geolat
[01:26:01] has an agenda to take out psycho
[01:26:05] today oh okay here comes the ground
[01:26:07] pound nice Dodge very nice
[01:26:11] Dodge I think our contestants have a
[01:26:15] remembered oh oh psycho commentator curs
[01:26:19] taking a hit you know what I'm just not
[01:26:22] going say anything yeah we should stop
[01:26:24] talking about the players because every
[01:26:25] time we talk about the players they just
[01:26:27] instantly get eliminated or they just
[01:26:29] take a big hit you're right you're
[01:26:31] right all right we see nobody getting
[01:26:34] hit by that ground pound there everyone
[01:26:36] with the eye frames these to are just
[01:26:37] standing still behind the tree he is one
[01:26:39] with the tree he is
[01:26:42] tree oh F Master taking a hit here so
[01:26:46] team atsu's unpaid employees looking
[01:26:49] dangerous I think Z just took a hit
[01:26:51] there
[01:26:52] fa is still in the green though so oh
[01:26:55] joining ta oh no he's ter smash oh he's
[01:26:59] he's he's trying he's trying to cage him
[01:27:02] in he's trying to cage him in that's
[01:27:05] actually
[01:27:06] smart because when you are caged in and
[01:27:09] you try to exit you end up climbing the
[01:27:11] sides of the construct which does delay
[01:27:14] how quickly you can run away Master
[01:27:16] opening the menu again not sure what
[01:27:18] this guy's trying to get up to here
[01:27:21] quick Z was the one that did take a HP
[01:27:24] loss earlier as well so we do see Z and
[01:27:27] Bob both at 4,244 HP some nice Dodges
[01:27:30] coming out from zionic oh he's lamenting
[01:27:33] wow some very very good Dodges he sa
[01:27:36] this is what he saved the laments for
[01:27:37] from earlier yeah yeah yeah all right
[01:27:40] now that we've spoken about Z and we
[01:27:42] given him some compliments maybe his ego
[01:27:44] has gotten a little bit too big and he
[01:27:46] might die here let's see he's he's cocky
[01:27:48] he's challenging the lava CH he's like
[01:27:51] come at me he's saying come at me he is
[01:27:54] slowly approaching Tonto which I don't
[01:27:56] think is the right play dragging the the
[01:27:58] enemy to your your ally you want to be
[01:28:00] dragging the enemy to your enemies
[01:28:04] yeah okay the Geo Shield is going to
[01:28:07] expire
[01:28:08] sunish on the lava CH we see fob Master
[01:28:11] trying to focus toono who is currently
[01:28:13] gliding through the skies without a care
[01:28:16] in theill very chill at full HP wow Bob
[01:28:20] Master with a really big Geo cont truck
[01:28:22] there to to dive I think she has trapped
[01:28:25] the lava TR yeah lava getting a bit tra
[01:28:28] comes down loses the shield as well so
[01:28:31] if anyone dies while the lava Char has
[01:28:33] no Shield that would be very very
[01:28:36] embarrassing I think that would be as
[01:28:38] you would say u a major skill issue a
[01:28:41] major skill issue all right psycho in
[01:28:43] the red
[01:28:45] now should still be
[01:28:48] okay now tip for the players here you
[01:28:51] should save your Elemental burst for
[01:28:54] when you feel like you're not going to
[01:28:55] be able to get the eye frame off or when
[01:28:56] you have no stamina M that's right as
[01:28:59] you will not take damage during the
[01:29:00] elemental burst
[01:29:03] animation we are down to the final 90
[01:29:05] second here the lava TR does reapply the
[01:29:08] goo
[01:29:09] Shield here come some big attacks it's
[01:29:12] going to be make break for da here oh B
[01:29:16] Master goes
[01:29:18] down oh no looks like you'll be able to
[01:29:20] hang on for this last 1 minute 20
[01:29:22] seconds Tanto still has full
[01:29:26] HP oh what a huge ey
[01:29:30] frame wow tono flexing his muscles here
[01:29:35] Zio still looking very very good here
[01:29:37] still in the green
[01:29:40] mhm psycho is still living oh comment's
[01:29:44] curs Toto is down to 4,244 hit points as
[01:29:49] well but the shield is about to
[01:29:52] expire which means surely no one gets
[01:29:57] eliminated here now the Geo Shield is
[01:29:59] now down all the dangerous attacks are
[01:30:01] gone all of these attacks can now be
[01:30:03] very they're very much telegraphed now
[01:30:05] mhm it looks like the LA TR is also
[01:30:07] getting pretty stuck with all these
[01:30:09] obstacles in the way too very good
[01:30:10] placement of the constructs and um the
[01:30:14] little spikes that come up from your ver
[01:30:16] we are down to the last 20
[01:30:19] seconds I believe in in our last three
[01:30:23] remaining contestants All Right
[01:30:25] contestants for the last 10 seconds you
[01:30:27] guys should stand together and Dodge at
[01:30:29] the last second I think that is what
[01:30:31] they're doing oh no psycho what have I
[01:30:34] done I'm so sorry I'm so sorry psycho
[01:30:39] going down there meaning Tonto and
[01:30:41] zionic take the
[01:30:43] W oh no what have I done I'm a monster
[01:30:49] actual commentator
[01:30:50] curse so the winners this time are going
[01:30:53] to be team atus neglected
[01:30:57] child have they taken all the games
[01:31:01] today I I forgot who won the
[01:31:04] race no they won the race as well I
[01:31:07] think they won every single match today
[01:31:08] so far they are up and in the
[01:31:12] ascendancy but is going to be down to
[01:31:14] the Boss Rush once again I do believe
[01:31:17] they were in the lead yesterday as well
[01:31:18] and then they lost it everywhere and
[01:31:20] they lost everything at the Boss Rush
[01:31:21] which
[01:31:22] fin yes it's not over till it's j it's
[01:31:26] not over till it's j and I believe for
[01:31:29] the next contest the Boss Rush we are
[01:31:30] going to have some special guests today
[01:31:34] so we'll see those people appearing on
[01:31:36] stage later on I see them directly in
[01:31:38] front of me I see Mr boxbox looking a
[01:31:41] little bit confused hi boxbox hi
[01:31:45] Albert and we have our Raffle winners
[01:31:47] here we have MIT sway sub sh AA and SK
[01:31:53] I'm not pronouncing this
[01:31:56] correctly seeit maybe it's a silent J or
[01:32:01] SJ that's most definitely wrong I want
[01:32:04] to say s I think that sounds right
[01:32:07] anyway congratulations make sure you go
[01:32:09] to your Twitch settings turn your
[01:32:11] Whispers on it might take 24 to 48 hours
[01:32:14] to load your whisper settings changes so
[01:32:16] make sure to just have a bit of patience
[01:32:18] and the prizes will hopefully be on your
[01:32:21] way so we see neglected children on 1,0
[01:32:26] points to at unplayed employees on
[01:32:30] zero how do you feel about this
[01:32:33] U wow cuz yesterday it was you know even
[01:32:37] though we had winners it was still like
[01:32:39] pretty neck and neck it was like a 5 10
[01:32:40] point difference
[01:32:42] but well that is quite the big disparity
[01:32:46] there
[01:32:47] so it's going to take a
[01:32:50] colossal comeback
[01:32:53] comeback and it it's it's going to need
[01:32:56] a colossal mistake from Z and tto to
[01:33:00] lose such a huge lead but I believe we
[01:33:03] are going to have the host introduce our
[01:33:07] new players here who could turn the tide

[01:34:47] hearing Redemption Arc The Comeback
[01:34:49] story do you think it's possible how how
[01:34:51] are you feeling I think that uh Bob
[01:34:54] master was really good yesterday I think
[01:34:56] our chemistry was perfect I think I'm
[01:34:58] going to go up there and the two
[01:34:59] hungover gamers are going to show what
[01:35:01] we can
[01:35:02] do okay you said it let's see get to
[01:35:05] your position thank you so much okay
[01:35:08] everybody you all ready for this come on
[01:35:11] show me some love here yes I love the
[01:35:14] energy thank you so much twitchcon and
[01:35:16] thank you twitch chat y'all are great as
[01:35:18] well let's get this competition started
[01:35:20] going to hand it over to the
[01:35:25] commentators thank you Jackie and I was
[01:35:28] not the one who said hung over okay that
[01:35:31] was James I'm not exposing anyone from
[01:35:33] Master may or may not be hung over
[01:35:36] anyway the final showdown now with the
[01:35:39] teams having some new members we have
[01:35:42] boxbox Albert joining team Z and Toronto
[01:35:46] and we have James oh sorry we have Jake
[01:35:49] joining team F master and psycho as J as
[01:35:54] Jake said two hungover Gamers let's see
[01:35:58] how they do they have to claw back over
[01:36:01] 1,045 Point disparity mhm that is a
[01:36:05] pretty big amount of points it is a
[01:36:07] toall orderer but hey I feel like when
[01:36:10] you have a team even adding one person
[01:36:13] can really change the dynamic so maybe
[01:36:15] having these new uh two new guests
[01:36:19] joining us today will be able to really
[01:36:22] turn the tides of how the tournament is
[01:36:25] going their Synergy yesterday was really
[01:36:28] really good exactly yeah yesterday they
[01:36:30] went with the net the noita the cookie
[01:36:33] shobu and kokomi I believe kokomi yeah
[01:36:37] they had really really good Synergy
[01:36:38] yesterday on that team so I'm expecting
[01:36:43] something impressive again today and and
[01:36:46] not just that but I feel like you know
[01:36:48] since they've already done it once
[01:36:50] usually once is is good enough to get a
[01:36:53] good grasp of what's going on so I'm
[01:36:55] excited to see what their strategies are
[01:36:57] for today especially Having learned from
[01:36:59] the mistakes of yesterday that we saw
[01:37:02] we're again relying a little too much on
[01:37:04] dandro and Hyper blo I think maybe we'll
[01:37:07] see some new elements in their game play
[01:37:09] today so they did all both teams did go
[01:37:12] for hyper Bloom teams centered around
[01:37:14] Net and cookie shinobu and dendra
[01:37:17] characters so we'll see what they're
[01:37:18] going to go with this time so this is
[01:37:20] going to be the Boss Rush so every
[01:37:23] single team both teams have a time limit
[01:37:26] of 10 minutes and they have to defeat
[01:37:28] some of the weekly bosses and open world
[01:37:30] bosses weekly bosses are going to come
[01:37:32] first and the boss's difficulty will
[01:37:34] determine how many points you get for
[01:37:36] each of those so bosses worth 200 points
[01:37:39] the weekly bosses can only be defeated
[01:37:41] once then all the other bosses can be
[01:37:43] beaten an unlimited amount of times now
[01:37:46] if you do lose against a weekly boss you
[01:37:49] cannot re-enter that Weekly boss you
[01:37:50] will just leave with zero points for
[01:37:52] that specific boss and you can see this
[01:37:55] is the boss table asaha Ryden we have
[01:37:59] scar we do not have number four here
[01:38:02] unlocked I believe so you go straight to
[01:38:04] laora and then you also have Talia and
[01:38:07] also the mechanism which name I do not
[01:38:11] remember and cannot pronounce I think
[01:38:13] people just call him Simon Simon the one
[01:38:15] in the desert yes exactly so yesterday
[01:38:19] we did see Team atus I keep getting
[01:38:22] names confused atsu
[01:38:24] unemployed un unpaid employe
[01:38:27] unemploy are they really if they they're
[01:38:30] not if they're not paid are they really
[01:38:31] they might as well be unemployed though
[01:38:33] you know true true true so we saw them
[01:38:35] get to Simon yesterday and team Z and
[01:38:40] Jake fed and they they were eliminated
[01:38:44] at
[01:38:45] loraa that's right yeah uh oh I I had
[01:38:49] something to say but I totally forget
[01:38:50] what it was maybe if you keep talking U
[01:38:53] it'll come back to me I keep poking you
[01:38:55] might remember so once again yesterday
[01:38:58] both teams focused on hyper Bloom
[01:39:01] actually no it wasn't K it was zong Le
[01:39:04] that they had oh it was the other team
[01:39:07] that had Ki yeah the first team went
[01:39:09] with kokomi and lost second team
[01:39:12] improved this is Z's words improved on
[01:39:16] their team and the second team added
[01:39:18] zong Lee instead of kakomi going for and
[01:39:21] guess who won team zong Le so I see to
[01:39:25] my right hand side here I have a little
[01:39:26] sneak peek of the zionic tono team and
[01:39:30] it looks like they've decided to go
[01:39:31] ahead and make those improved changes
[01:39:35] and copy the team that to or rather fob
[01:39:39] and psycho came up with yesterday
[01:39:41] replacing the alhan with naha and also
[01:39:45] replacing the kakomi with the zongi all
[01:39:47] of the characters are constellation six
[01:39:49] so zongi operates as a excellent Corp
[01:39:51] shielder and healer because the shield
[01:39:54] actually heals you at constellation 6
[01:39:57] for zong Le so this is going to be very
[01:39:59] exciting it's all down to keeping noet
[01:40:01] and Nita alive the two main damage
[01:40:03] dealers of this team that's right and
[01:40:06] personally I really prefer um using uh
[01:40:09] Nita over alham or as I like to refer to
[01:40:12] him lovingly the ham um because I do
[01:40:15] think uh Nita has a way better rate of
[01:40:18] dendro application and not just that but
[01:40:20] she can also do a lot of dender
[01:40:22] application off field whereas with alham
[01:40:25] you have to keep him on field for he the
[01:40:28] hyper Car 3D DPS yes that's right all
[01:40:31] right I still love alham I just want to
[01:40:33] make that clear yeah me me too me too
[01:40:35] absolutely want a All right so here we
[01:40:39] go we have Nita and cookie shobu being
[01:40:41] controlled by one player and then we
[01:40:43] have zong Lee and also net being the
[01:40:47] solo players here so we see net dropping
[01:40:50] the C6 damage already they did miss a
[01:40:53] few ticks at the beginning there for the
[01:40:56] hyper blo oh but look at how quickly
[01:40:58] they're melting yeah they are melting
[01:41:00] here they need to get out of there
[01:41:02] though he's going into the his next
[01:41:05] phase I believe they are going to next
[01:41:07] phase and while asaha transitioning
[01:41:08] phases you cannot damage him so here we
[01:41:11] go cookie shobu healing everyone back up
[01:41:13] again and it's going to be pyro we have
[01:41:16] the Pyro as coming through
[01:41:19] here fine for aga the worst phe is or
[01:41:23] worst element is pyro because of all
[01:41:26] those explosions and there's so much
[01:41:28] it's literally the floor is lava they
[01:41:30] have to be bit careful here the noet
[01:41:34] going down very low there a little bit
[01:41:36] dangerous regaining his HP he is
[01:41:38] regaining his hit points but they are
[01:41:40] just standing in the range they need
[01:41:42] healing ASAP because they are all
[01:41:44] inflicted with burn and they are ticking
[01:41:46] away here ooh okay they're playing a
[01:41:49] little bit risky here net able to heal
[01:41:53] up okay big damage coming out from net
[01:41:56] we have a little bit of hyper Boom
[01:41:57] coming out Z element to burst at the end
[01:42:00] there they just have to tank this this
[01:42:02] uh tree phase and then they should be
[01:42:05] good to go they should be good to go it
[01:42:08] is a little bit concerning how much
[01:42:09] damage they are willing to take oh why
[01:42:12] theyy don't do that jumping the gun a
[01:42:15] little
[01:42:16] there okay so and with a time of 1
[01:42:20] minute and 27 seconds they are able to
[01:42:23] eliminate asaha for 200 points now
[01:42:26] teleporting to the right boss quickly is
[01:42:29] also going to be very important every
[01:42:31] second matters here because yesterday as
[01:42:33] we saw for fun master and psycho team if
[01:42:36] they had maybe like 15 more seconds they
[01:42:37] would have been able to take down Simon
[01:42:39] not that they needed it but I guess they
[01:42:41] needed it today cuz they are many points
[01:42:43] down right now oh teammates not ready
[01:42:45] where's the coordination they're losing
[01:42:47] time here okay we are loading in with a
[01:42:50] starting time of 8 minutes here so here
[01:42:54] we go Ryden
[01:42:58] Shogun that was a little bit little bit
[01:43:00] scary there because I did see nuet run
[01:43:02] straight up in front of Ryden as she
[01:43:03] launched the slash W damage is
[01:43:06] absolutely
[01:43:08] insane con to 50,000 50,000 50,000 hey
[01:43:12] you know what they say A you don't need
[01:43:14] to dodge if you can just out de exactly
[01:43:16] the best offense is a oh sorry the best
[01:43:19] defense is a great offense all right
[01:43:23] that was so fast 30 seconds they are
[01:43:26] over to scar oh no they don't know where
[01:43:29] to go okay they're going to Talia it
[01:43:32] seems I I think they're meant to be
[01:43:34] going to Scaro
[01:43:36] here I I think that was a bit of a
[01:43:38] misplay they've got over to Talia it's
[01:43:40] meant to be Scaro next o they
[01:43:43] commentator C they've lost a bit of time
[01:43:46] there okay here we go into the workshop
[01:43:48] we go let's see are they able to to
[01:43:50] ready up really quickly okay they're
[01:43:52] straight
[01:43:53] in are they ready to ready up well
[01:43:57] they're just chilling on the
[01:43:59] uh on the
[01:44:03] please they said at you please maybe
[01:44:06] they're begging you for some U mercy no
[01:44:09] commentators
[01:44:11] curse okay here we
[01:44:15] go we have the Everlasting Lord of
[01:44:18] Arcane wisdom shoam that's
[01:44:21] right I remember when this boss first
[01:44:24] came out uh I was pretty impressed I
[01:44:26] thought he was really really cool very
[01:44:27] cool boss indeed lot of damage coming
[01:44:30] through once again from the net net C6
[01:44:34] just so much damage we see spitting
[01:44:37] around doing the Beyblade
[01:44:40] Tech okay here we go we have the next
[01:44:43] phase this is the phase where you know
[01:44:45] your skill matters the most I think yeah
[01:44:47] this is the phase where they did lose
[01:44:48] the nlet yesterday because they they
[01:44:50] weren't able to break the Everlasting
[01:44:54] Lord of Arcane wisdom out of his shield
[01:44:57] phase that's right and he did drop the
[01:45:00] the his own mini meteor I wouldn't say
[01:45:02] his mini his his gigantic meteor right
[01:45:05] oh so close oh that was a big switch
[01:45:09] coming through switching over this
[01:45:11] healer just in time the heer very low
[01:45:14] there that was very very risky they are
[01:45:16] really just tanking all the damage like
[01:45:19] I think they're going hyper Rive here
[01:45:21] right now to try do as much through the
[01:45:23] shield to force this right now big hit
[01:45:26] coming through on the cookie shoa but
[01:45:27] cookie shoba has so much HP
[01:45:30] constellation even moving yeah
[01:45:32] constellation 6 cookie shinobu can
[01:45:34] survive one lethal hit that's true and
[01:45:37] the more damage that she does take or
[01:45:39] the lower her HP is the more em she
[01:45:41] provides to her team she does yes okay
[01:45:44] The Shield is going down
[01:45:47] here all right HP is looking good for
[01:45:50] all the players on this team right now
[01:45:52] so here we go this is the phase where we
[01:45:55] did lose the noet is we is that going to
[01:45:58] happen again hopefully not well we see a
[01:45:59] repeat of what happened yesterday I I
[01:46:01] don't think so I think I think they have
[01:46:03] the tools this
[01:46:05] time all right the n one shotting all of
[01:46:09] these with
[01:46:12] Char n and Z slowly working on the one
[01:46:15] in the middle it's it's the effort that
[01:46:17] matters you know it's the train that
[01:46:19] counts here it's a pretty they're doing
[01:46:21] pretty well I think and all right
[01:46:23] they've got it down the Neo acasha
[01:46:26] terminal has enough energy and how
[01:46:28] quickly are we going to see the
[01:46:30] Everlasting Lord of Arcane wisdom get
[01:46:32] eliminated here they have already done
[01:46:34] quite a number on his health all right
[01:46:37] here we go oh he's being
[01:46:40] deleted all right 4 minutes 10 seconds
[01:46:43] remaining and they instantly out very
[01:46:45] very smooth moves there we see help we
[01:46:48] see help as an SOS side
[01:46:51] all right L next was it worth the 5
[01:46:54] Seconds to show that help side we'll
[01:46:56] find out here we
[01:46:59] go all right yesterday we also did see
[01:47:01] they did struggle a little bit on lenur
[01:47:03] trying to get the butterflies they did
[01:47:04] waste a lot of time by accidentally
[01:47:06] killing some of the Butterflies
[01:47:08] teammate's not ready all right we lost a
[01:47:10] couple of seconds there will it cost
[01:47:12] them we'll find out here we
[01:47:15] go says you're is it the co or just
[01:47:19] count wow that was flawlessly delivered
[01:47:22] auu that's right I am going to be Las
[01:47:26] I'm just kidding you're going to be Las
[01:47:27] when she's resurrected from the dad
[01:47:30] right just to just to disclaimer that is
[01:47:33] not anything official no yes is we do
[01:47:35] not know if that's going to happen all
[01:47:38] right here we go we are already in the
[01:47:40] ice
[01:47:42] phase where they are trying to melt with
[01:47:44] the
[01:47:47] butterflies okay so the one thing with
[01:47:49] cookie shobi is that shinobu with her
[01:47:51] Elemental skill here can accidentally
[01:47:53] kill the butterflies that they do need
[01:47:55] to pick up
[01:47:57] here he is able to pick that one up they
[01:48:01] are chipping away at the shield while
[01:48:02] she cold is also chipping away at them
[01:48:04] is a little bit low on
[01:48:06] HP and the sheer cold is we're back here
[01:48:10] again with the sheer cold we are back
[01:48:11] here with the shear cold however we are
[01:48:14] into the Final Phase they have all of
[01:48:16] their characters still alive this should
[01:48:19] go down very very very quickly net is
[01:48:23] about to delete some HP oh as you can
[01:48:25] see
[01:48:26] extinguishing the Lora is being
[01:48:29] extinguished right
[01:48:31] now okay there we go Lora is down they
[01:48:34] have 2 minutes and 17 seconds still on
[01:48:37] the clock next boss is going to be Talia
[01:48:40] are they able to locate the Talia we are
[01:48:43] in
[01:48:44] mon we are in mon we are why are we
[01:48:47] teleporting to
[01:48:49] mon
[01:48:52] what is the strategy what is happen
[01:48:53] interested to see
[01:48:55] what what is going on are We condensing
[01:48:59] resin are we
[01:49:02] strong oh my God you know what it is TW
[01:49:07] is so confident he's so confident that
[01:49:11] the other team are so far behind that we
[01:49:15] are just
[01:49:17] vibing they're looking for good gear
[01:49:19] here
[01:49:22] here are we farming artifacts for sh
[01:49:26] Perhaps Perhaps all right they're that
[01:49:30] confident and to be honest I think
[01:49:32] they're going to take down tartalo
[01:49:33] really really quickly a bit of a flex
[01:49:35] and a dunk on the enemy team here coming
[01:49:38] from atsu's neglected
[01:49:40] children okay let's see how quickly are
[01:49:43] they able to take down tartal here they
[01:49:45] have just over 1 minute remaining I
[01:49:47] think they're going to be able to do it
[01:49:48] in around 30 40 seconds here
[01:49:51] which will net them up to
[01:49:53] 980 points right we do
[01:49:57] see the tap Elemental skill coming
[01:49:59] through here instead of the hold at the
[01:50:01] beginning he's already on the second
[01:50:03] phase we are on the second phase
[01:50:06] here going now very very quick child is
[01:50:10] down and we are onto the Final
[01:50:13] Phase ooh
[01:50:16] okay and I think this is going to be the
[01:50:18] final boss that they can take down
[01:50:20] that's right we are in the last 30
[01:50:24] seconds and there we go Talia is
[01:50:27] down down and out for the count they're
[01:50:30] going all over to the Statue of the
[01:50:32] seven I wonder why what are they going
[01:50:34] to show us here what is Tonto going to

[01:51:18] Jake if they are able to
[01:51:23] eliminate enough bosses fast enough they
[01:51:27] need to eliminate like four extra bosses
[01:51:30] oh man they might be able to claw their
[01:51:34] way back cuz the disparity is really
[01:51:39] big however I want to say something that

[01:53:26] best of luck so do you think team atsu's
[01:53:31] unpaid employees have a chance oh
[01:53:35] they've got for a different team they
[01:53:36] going with y
[01:53:38] m
[01:53:40] oh you see what they're doing here
[01:53:43] they're going super aggressive here they
[01:53:46] have three characters that have a lot of
[01:53:50] Dage here and only is the only one so
[01:53:54] whoever is playing Z has to time his
[01:53:57] Elemental burst perfectly to make sure
[01:54:00] they don't lose any characters yiko is
[01:54:02] one of the squishiest characters in
[01:54:04] genin Impact this is a C6 yo though so
[01:54:08] let's see are they going to have enough
[01:54:10] damage oh the electro charge doing quite
[01:54:12] a lot of damage there okay they're
[01:54:14] already down in the first phase they're
[01:54:16] already down not sure about oh no y so
[01:54:20] not sure about that oh Yo's skill she's
[01:54:23] very very good with Mobility using the
[01:54:25] skill oh no yo is so low commentators
[01:54:27] curse right there Yo's Elemental burst I
[01:54:30] felt like was a little bit of a waste
[01:54:32] and also put them in a very difficult
[01:54:34] position however the damage was huge we
[01:54:36] have the elemental burst coming down
[01:54:37] from Z clearing down a shield so yo will
[01:54:40] want to take a couple of hits here to be
[01:54:42] able to heal up only a couple though not
[01:54:44] too many so we already down that phase
[01:54:46] is already down that was
[01:54:48] inants really really going for this oh
[01:54:51] my goodness they're going hyper hyper
[01:54:52] aggressive so here we go we got some
[01:54:55] healing coming through for n o yo may
[01:54:59] have enter some dangerous territory here
[01:55:01] I see net is standing on some pyro
[01:55:03] Flames here as well so he's going to be
[01:55:04] burning down we have the elemental burst
[01:55:06] coming down from zongi as well so
[01:55:08] everyone has the shields back on are
[01:55:09] they able to take that as before he
[01:55:11] borrows if they are are they able to do
[01:55:14] it no they just one second too short so
[01:55:18] unfortunate because we have 10 minutes
[01:55:20] and this timer is still counting down
[01:55:23] even when you're entering these takes a
[01:55:25] long time that's right yeah and I was
[01:55:27] going to say U that you know you think
[01:55:29] that 10 minutes is a lot but as we've
[01:55:32] seen like you can only manage to get in
[01:55:35] maybe likees we do see a time of 1
[01:55:38] minute 20 seconds for the aaha for those
[01:55:40] of you who don't know you can actually
[01:55:42] eliminate aaha before he borrows and it
[01:55:44] would be enough right they are heading
[01:55:46] over to Ryden Shogun very very very
[01:55:49] quickly here not sure if they given
[01:55:50] enough time for yiko to heal we'll find
[01:55:52] out in a moment yo is still low maybe
[01:55:55] they're just going to go for it maybe
[01:55:57] they're not going to go here oh he's
[01:55:59] accidentally entered oh no them some
[01:56:02] time oh no commentator's cursed they've
[01:56:04] accidentally entered the domain too
[01:56:06] quickly oh no I'm wondering if this
[01:56:08] counts as as a I'm sure we'll allow them
[01:56:11] to go back in I think so we we should
[01:56:13] allow them to go back in all right get
[01:56:15] back in there get back in there so yo is
[01:56:17] still alive they are going to go
[01:56:18] straight in
[01:56:20] jumping the gun a little bit there not
[01:56:23] waiting for the teammates that may have
[01:56:24] cost them some precious time all right
[01:56:26] here we go though we have seen the yiko
[01:56:28] does do a lot of extra damage and
[01:56:30] there's no phases to limit the damage
[01:56:32] how much you can do you can go straight
[01:56:33] in on yiko here okay the very
[01:56:37] low yo very low the yiko pick though
[01:56:41] because she's extremely good with single
[01:56:43] Target damage yes she is all right we
[01:56:46] are seeing are single Target Ryden be
[01:56:48] Absolut melted here lots and lots and
[01:56:52] lots of damage coming through are they
[01:56:54] able to get ring down before she splits
[01:56:56] into multiple Parts no they're no oh no
[01:56:58] that is so unfortunate that is so
[01:57:02] unfortunate they went to the wrong Ryden
[01:57:04] as well oh no that is so unfortunate the
[01:57:06] heart is in the right place but the
[01:57:08] skill is not there we are having a bit
[01:57:11] of a skill issue here right we move on
[01:57:13] to the next boss which is going to be
[01:57:16] the tra not the traveler not the wander
[01:57:19] scar Mo so we do eliminate Ryden Shogun
[01:57:23] they are healing up at the Statue of the
[01:57:25] seven I hope they did get the healing
[01:57:26] off there because he did open the menu
[01:57:29] as soon as they went to statel 7 not
[01:57:31] sure if the healing did get through
[01:57:33] we'll see everyone is healed back to
[01:57:35] full they're straight into car but let's
[01:57:37] hope they don't jump into the game
[01:57:38] straight away we have 6 minutes 30
[01:57:41] seconds on the clock for this
[01:57:43] one Z is ready up here we go so the Yon
[01:57:48] might be able to come through here
[01:57:49] provide a lot of extra damage the first
[01:57:50] phase does not limit you on the damage
[01:57:53] as well so they should be able to melt
[01:57:55] phase one here I think phase one it will
[01:57:57] be really easy for them to get through
[01:57:59] but phase two o phase two as that's
[01:58:02] going to be the tricky one yeah I do
[01:58:04] think he has a bit of Electro resistance
[01:58:06] as well but it's still going to be quite
[01:58:09] big the yo is still more damage than the
[01:58:11] cookie shobu that's true all right we
[01:58:14] see the arm here coming through all
[01:58:17] right we see he's being melted he is
[01:58:19] indeed being melted here ooh okay so
[01:58:23] something that they do want to avoid is
[01:58:25] putting the pillars too close to the
[01:58:28] enemy because it will take away some of
[01:58:29] the elements with the crystallized
[01:58:31] reaction instead you don't want the
[01:58:32] crystallized to override any of the
[01:58:33] other reactions you want to keep having
[01:58:36] the Quicken the cataliz the hyper BL
[01:58:38] instead of the crystallizes all right we
[01:58:40] see the shield starting to be chipped
[01:58:42] away right now they are not going
[01:58:44] they're not really going super
[01:58:45] aggressive on him right now because it
[01:58:47] is a bit
[01:58:48] dangerous
[01:58:50] I think they are biing their time a
[01:58:51] little and letting the uh you know the
[01:58:53] little puppets or little friends do most
[01:58:57] of the damage possibly I don't think
[01:58:59] they can afford to do that they need to
[01:59:00] burn through as much damage through the
[01:59:02] shield that they can but I do understand
[01:59:04] it is a little bit scary because nuet is
[01:59:07] under half HP n is very squishy yo is
[01:59:10] also very squishy as well I think the
[01:59:13] strategy they're going for actually is
[01:59:14] to try and just burn down the shield
[01:59:16] ASAP with the bombs that you can pick up
[01:59:18] from the ground and then just absolutely
[01:59:21] melt him all right n taking something
[01:59:24] big hits here oh n
[01:59:27] o n and net both in red HP right
[01:59:33] now all right Shield is about to go down
[01:59:36] here similar phase and similar timing to
[01:59:39] the other team okay Shield does go down
[01:59:42] so this phase is going to be very
[01:59:43] important how quickly they're able to
[01:59:45] eliminate this
[01:59:47] phase all right
[01:59:50] they need to destroy the an air sap oh
[01:59:52] no's about to go down oh no she is under
[01:59:56] one k all right the shield has been
[01:59:58] dropped for Nita's sake
[02:00:00] here all right here we go 4
[02:00:04] minutes 4 minutes 10
[02:00:07] seconds all right they need to
[02:00:09] absolutely melt him here you can just
[02:00:11] straight up run to his legs instead of
[02:00:12] going all the way up towards his head as
[02:00:14] well to do
[02:00:15] [Music]
[02:00:16] damage coming through from the lots of
[02:00:19] damage from the Yik oh 83,000 damage
[02:00:23] that was
[02:00:24] big all right he's down 3 minut 50
[02:00:28] seconds straight out of the domain as
[02:00:29] well to Lora are they going to be able
[02:00:32] to make it to Lora are they even going
[02:00:33] to bother healing up the Nita I don't
[02:00:35] think they can afford to heal up Nita
[02:00:37] here they're just going to have to rely
[02:00:38] on the zong Le and dodging ability here
[02:00:41] we go very very risky play but again
[02:00:44] with 3 and 1/2 minutes left on the clock
[02:00:47] every second count every second does
[02:00:50] count can they do it I think they'll
[02:00:52] actually be able to get past Simon as
[02:00:54] well all right here we go even let's
[02:00:59] just let's just make the claim here now
[02:01:00] disclaimer here even if they are not
[02:01:03] able to catch up the 1,000 point dispar
[02:01:05] tetin if they are able to get past Simon
[02:01:08] that will be an improvement from
[02:01:09] yesterday which is going to be very very
[02:01:11] big for
[02:01:13] sure right we have the elemental burst
[02:01:15] coming through here to no avail I think
[02:01:17] that burst was a little bit Wast
[02:01:20] unfortunately we have the butterfly phe
[02:01:24] they're looking for the butterfli they
[02:01:25] are looking for the butterflies right
[02:01:26] now they have to be careful not to
[02:01:28] accident accidentally eliminate the
[02:01:30] butterflies though with the elemental
[02:01:32] skills that they've left on the field
[02:01:33] The Shield is still above half Health
[02:01:36] but the shear cold is already kicking in
[02:01:39] Shear cold is kicking in it's going to
[02:01:40] be quite dangerous for n they can't
[02:01:42] switch in the right now because the
[02:01:43] shear cold will eliminate the Nik that's
[02:01:45] true even with the shield from Z on
[02:01:49] we here we are almost down here just one
[02:01:53] more hit one more one more butterfly
[02:01:56] where's the butterfly it's not appearing
[02:01:58] okay they just brute forced it right
[02:02:01] here we go okay we have y getting some
[02:02:03] preemptive damage up here very very nice
[02:02:06] Elemental burst on the Nita to protect
[02:02:09] the Nita from being eliminated here wow
[02:02:12] that is a big damage Elemental burst
[02:02:14] misses the last two ticks but the damage
[02:02:16] is absolutely huge they eliminated
[02:02:18] already they still
[02:02:20] they to Talia who they can probably
[02:02:22] finish with 40 seconds and that gives
[02:02:24] them around 1 minute 20 seconds to go
[02:02:25] ahead and take down Simon are they going
[02:02:27] to be able to do it it's really really
[02:02:30] really close it's all about the moral
[02:02:31] Victory here if they win the Boss Rush
[02:02:34] it's all about the moral Victory maybe
[02:02:35] they won't have enough points to surpass
[02:02:37] the prior team but it is about the moral
[02:02:40] Victory yes for
[02:02:44] sure OPP is all right loading into the
[02:02:47] tartania boss fight Natalia does hit
[02:02:49] very hard in Co-op so the N has to be
[02:02:52] careful here Z also has to be kind of
[02:02:54] careful here we are in the next phase
[02:02:56] though phase two incoming phase two is
[02:02:58] going to be eliminated very very quickly
[02:02:59] the Shields coming on to great on the
[02:03:02] zie bur as well all right we have the
[02:03:05] next phase hopefully they don't get jump
[02:03:07] scared and eliminated quickly here maybe
[02:03:09] taking a few hits with Nita here might
[02:03:11] be the play just so that they can heal
[02:03:14] up Shield is going to expire soon though
[02:03:17] so they have to be a bit careful with
[02:03:18] the n here Elemental burst coming
[02:03:20] through on the N oh The Shield has oh
[02:03:23] very low HP very very low HP Talia does
[02:03:28] get eliminated they have 47 seconds to
[02:03:30] go ahead and eliminate Simon are they
[02:03:33] going to be able to do it all the way to
[02:03:36] they got to run run run find the correct
[02:03:38] teleporter they're all going 2p is
[02:03:40] already there one p making their way
[02:03:42] there as well we have zong Le on life
[02:03:44] support y mik on life support n on life
[02:03:48] support
[02:03:50] carrying the team is there okay dodging
[02:03:53] is going to be really really important
[02:03:54] here they only have 20 seconds are they
[02:03:56] going to be able to make it ooh it's
[02:03:58] going to be so close all right yiko
[02:04:00] leading the charge setting up with her
[02:04:03] totems animation takes so long though 10
[02:04:08] seconds left 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 oh it's so
