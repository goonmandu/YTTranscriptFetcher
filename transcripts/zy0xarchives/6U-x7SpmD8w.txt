[00:26:04] poster in your room of this very
[00:26:05] artifact and one day you'll get it too
[00:26:08] you're welcome inspirational words from
[00:26:09] zox foreign artifacts are forever
[00:26:15] to prevent baud raids no it's fine dude
[00:26:18] I don't
[00:26:19] it's fine it like usually we'll turn
[00:26:21] that on if anything happens but like
[00:26:24] that's fine I don't I don't want I don't
[00:26:26] like baiting people to follow me like if
[00:26:27] you follow me you never watch me like I
[00:26:28] don't give a [ __ ] about the follow like
[00:26:30] it's like I appreciate it don't get me
[00:26:32] wrong but like it's fine
[00:26:41] scratch that is fine
[00:26:45] anyways what is the stream I hope you
[00:26:47] guys are doing well I'm not I mean I am
[00:26:48] but I'm about to not because apparently
[00:26:50] this Abyss this [ __ ] ass but so Jeff
[00:26:52] says that about every Abyss he's like
[00:26:53] dude this Abyss has been the worst as I
[00:26:56] got for like ever missed but I know this
[00:26:58] one is like actually ass
[00:26:59] um which is good for us no it's bad it's
[00:27:01] bad but it's good for us because it
[00:27:04] means we have to make more content like
[00:27:05] listen I haven't spoiled it like I know
[00:27:08] what the enemies actually I don't I know
[00:27:09] what some are like I saw
[00:27:11] yeah but anyways it's good because what
[00:27:14] I get to do is if it's actually hard we
[00:27:16] get to try today then tomorrow
[00:27:18] randomizer spin the wheel that goes into
[00:27:22] a video and then the day after another
[00:27:24] surprise that you have planned but I
[00:27:25] can't reveal it because it's surprised
[00:27:26] and if I told you guess what it wouldn't
[00:27:28] be a surprise
[00:27:31] totally the twelve one Karma it's not
[00:27:33] five months hamazura these are two
[00:27:35] months Messi this is the 16 months
[00:27:40] yeah we'll see
[00:27:42] I just okay so I saw I synced like I
[00:27:46] don't know like the waves and like how
[00:27:48] much and how many and how big and how
[00:27:49] strong and how tall and how large but I
[00:27:52] just clicked on this part like I looked
[00:27:54] briefly the fact that you need specific
[00:27:56] elements for second half maybe I will
[00:27:58] okay this is what I think is [ __ ] design
[00:28:00] the only thing that I don't like and I
[00:28:01] haven't played this yet but like without
[00:28:03] even doing it I think the fact that you
[00:28:05] need something for cryos usually pyro
[00:28:07] and that's something for hydros usually
[00:28:09] dendro but other elements can work too
[00:28:10] and then it turns into Thunder
[00:28:12] manifestation is kind of a [ __ ] you
[00:28:14] because that means like unless you want
[00:28:15] to play like big Tonka T right tanari
[00:28:17] with like yai Miko and Fishel then
[00:28:19] yaimiko and Fishel become useless for
[00:28:21] Thunder manifestation and then but like
[00:28:23] they're really good here so it's like
[00:28:24] [ __ ] annoying but it is what it is
[00:28:26] you'd probably play like [ __ ]
[00:28:27] shangling oppa and then you're fine or
[00:28:30] virgin Maybe
[00:28:33] so we'll see let me go do my dailies and
[00:28:34] stuff first I'll do that it's for you
[00:28:36] and yeah yeah but who likes showing me
[00:28:38] I'm sorry I love him yeah Nation I would
[00:28:41] be her bandage
[00:28:44] balls
[00:28:50] dude if if Ito rerun means Jill wolf
[00:28:53] Ford in the abyss I've said it before
[00:28:55] I'll say it again that means [ __ ] Ito
[00:28:57] reruns but if yomir rerun means Thunder
[00:28:59] manifestation then hey I'm sorry you
[00:29:01] immense but I value my sanity more than
[00:29:04] that character
[00:29:11] but yeah also also I've seen what like
[00:29:19] I still think shangling is gonna be way
[00:29:21] better to be honest
[00:29:24] because yeah about there's Baptist so
[00:29:26] there's also the cryo dudes so I'm not
[00:29:29] crowded is the hot the the Hydra ones
[00:29:34] so it shouldn't even be close but I
[00:29:36] don't really want to play strangling so
[00:29:38] what we're gonna do is we're gonna
[00:29:42] no
[00:29:47] I've been playing on mobile okay bear
[00:29:48] with me
[00:29:50] anyways I'm we're gonna bro stop
[00:29:55] oh dude let me live
[00:30:01] yeah okay we're fine
[00:30:03] um anyways as I was gonna say
[00:30:06] uh I don't even remember anymore
[00:30:10] autoplay brain rot
[00:30:13] did I actually played TCG like off
[00:30:15] stream and I was trying to auto play I
[00:30:17] was like where is the autoplay actually
[00:30:25] don't get fooled though I'm still zero
[00:30:27] death thing today zero death every
[00:30:28] chamber of the Abyss first try blind
[00:30:30] okay but we're gonna start by just
[00:30:32] clearing it then we're gonna do
[00:30:34] uh uh we're gonna test some teams then
[00:30:36] we're gonna do a four star only clear
[00:30:37] four star characters four star weapons
[00:30:39] easy clap then we're gonna try some
[00:30:41] other teams and then maybe some artifact
[00:30:43] stuff whatever tomorrow we're gonna do a
[00:30:46] spin the wheel randomizer that'll be
[00:30:48] turned into video and then the day after
[00:30:50] another special video also
[00:30:53] whenever I can I'm going to be forcing
[00:30:57] either Fang or Yuli to do this Abyss
[00:30:59] because it's hard and they're both skill
[00:31:01] issues so it would be good content of
[00:31:04] course there only means balls yes we're
[00:31:05] probably playing balls also you guys
[00:31:07] actually won't believe this but I farmed
[00:31:09] efficiently
[00:31:10] for every character but non-getchen in
[00:31:13] Star rail but what I didn't get is
[00:31:14] actually geared everyone you might be

[00:37:59] yeah I write guides and stuff it's
[00:38:03] pretty much the same and so he was like

[00:38:34] gift of some resin onto your account
[00:38:36] because he's a fan so we have 520 resin
[00:38:38] I wouldn't talk about myself maybe it
[00:38:40] was JK rolling on
[00:38:43] that's just little bits no I would not
[00:38:46] accept a donation
[00:38:47] from her how
[00:38:49] what I would accept is resin and we got
[00:38:51] resin but what I would uh what I want to
[00:38:54] say was I got uh you guys think oh I
[00:38:56] don't spend my oh I don't spend my I
[00:38:59] don't spend my resident officially socks
[00:39:00] what the [ __ ] are you doing socks socks
[00:39:01] what the [ __ ] are you doing okay explain
[00:39:04] this then
[00:39:05] how is my Bennett who's gonna be using
[00:39:07] Force our weapon uh in the four star
[00:39:08] clears today have a sapwood blade fully
[00:39:11] ascended to 90. I [ __ ] level this
[00:39:14] [ __ ] off stream 90. booms you didn't
[00:39:16] even know I could level the weapon I'll
[00:39:18] stream you didn't even know
[00:39:23] Elon level 40 stack bow first of all the
[00:39:26] level of her bow doesn't matter she
[00:39:28] scales on HP not attack so it doesn't
[00:39:29] [ __ ] matter second of all she's
[00:39:31] supposed to be on elegy someone probably
[00:39:32] took it it is what it is I have so many
[00:39:34] characters so little time and very
[00:39:37] little patience
[00:39:43] me I took it why is needle and doll
[00:39:46] blade it's your bestest thought if you
[00:39:47] disagree you're objectively wrong in
[00:39:48] every way until fonten releases their
[00:39:50] blacksmith HP percent weapon uh baguette
[00:39:54] vital which is gonna be the best replay
[00:39:56] option
[00:40:00] but neither is optimal double blade also
[00:40:01] I I kind of ungeared her artifacts a
[00:40:04] little she's on TV series because I
[00:40:06] wanted to give my HP Sans to Jean Lee
[00:40:09] because I don't think nilu is gonna be
[00:40:10] that good in this Abyss
[00:40:12] it is what it is
[00:40:14] everyone else is good though elon's on
[00:40:16] the wrong bow who the [ __ ] is that Coley
[00:40:18] yeah we'll take that is she here
[00:40:20] not bad
[00:40:22] HP is a little low man on my HP circuit
[00:40:25] oh that's why
[00:40:27] I will be fine though it'd probably go
[00:40:29] Hydro resonance yeah it'll be fine
[00:40:39] it is impressive autobiography that
[00:40:42] Stephen King wrote called I.T
[00:40:45] it
[00:40:47] dude it was a good movie
[00:40:49] I remember watching it in the cinema
[00:40:50] with zaj and other friends it was good
[00:40:53] I actually liked it
[00:40:56] wait okay are we spending resin or no
[00:40:58] because I feel like if I go Abyss I'm
[00:41:00] not gonna spend resin

[01:08:24] new one I don't like this prediction I
[01:08:26] don't like this prediction because it

[01:08:29] he gonna die how many deaths I don't
[01:08:31] like that we're gonna set up a new

[01:09:14] I just didn't know skill issue okay you
[01:09:16] have two minutes uh
[01:09:19] should I figure out my teams before I
[01:09:20] open the predictions
[01:09:24] okay the question okay listen
[01:09:27] before I open up the floodgates of
[01:09:29] prediction England sex chat before I
[01:09:31] open up the bridges I uh so I normally
[01:09:34] do a thing where for the new Abyss I
[01:09:36] won't like I won't like play Zhang Lee
[01:09:39] like I won't go like Shield like tanky
[01:09:40] build because I know if I do that I'm
[01:09:42] not [ __ ] die I cannot start this
[01:09:44] first try with my [ __ ] eyes closed if
[01:09:45] I play wrongly
[01:09:48] um with that in mind
[01:09:50] I kind of want to uh
[01:09:54] why are you guys think sure Bud do you
[01:09:57] think I can't you actually think I get
[01:09:58] okay granted I kind of just want to play
[01:10:01] like second off I kind of want to do
[01:10:03] like um
[01:10:11] I don't want to play shangling I
[01:10:12] actually think I'm playing shell first
[01:10:14] off that's gonna be easy first off is
[01:10:15] gonna be a joke but second half
[01:10:19] um
[01:10:20] I'm not sure
[01:10:22] because like I know you could just play
[01:10:23] [ __ ] like National and then just like
[01:10:25] oppa and then write in or the other dude
[01:10:27] child
[01:10:28] but I kind of don't want to play
[01:10:30] shangling because she sucks well she
[01:10:32] doesn't suck but she's dumb
[01:10:34] that jungling players don't even like
[01:10:36] shangling
[01:10:38] I'm not playing the Luke okay I am not
[01:10:41] first trying with the Luke
[01:10:46] I'm kidding I like shiny
[01:10:49] I whatever I'll set the game we have oh
[01:10:51] two minutes to vote while I figure out
[01:10:52] teams and stuff two minutes to vote if
[01:10:54] I'll first try it no recess no deaths
[01:10:56] sorry about your channel points by the
[01:10:58] way I'm sorry in advance
[01:11:00] do International no
[01:11:07] Scara why the [ __ ] would I submit myself
[01:11:09] to playing scarra in this Abyss
[01:11:12] you need like six different elements
[01:11:14] second half bro
[01:11:16] you need dendro Pyro
[01:11:20] so we're probably doing this and then
[01:11:39] I trust these dogs please win I don't
[01:11:42] want to lose all my points
[01:11:44] [ __ ] you doubters
[01:11:54] wait can I play a highlight them
[01:11:55] probably need pyro though right do I
[01:11:57] even need pyro wait what is this guy oh
[01:11:59] yeah Baptist yeah
[01:12:13] yo what if I play what if I play I'll
[01:12:15] hide them with Bennett
[01:12:17] I don't think I've ever played pirate
[01:12:19] I'll hide them with Bennett or we can
[01:12:21] also do like um like kooky Fishel that
[01:12:23] could probably break the cross Shield
[01:12:24] right surely
[01:12:33] it will work says a
[01:12:43] electron second half good one okay
[01:12:44] here's my take I haven't done it yet but
[01:12:46] I don't think Thunder manifestation is
[01:12:49] gonna be the hardest part and honestly
[01:12:50] like I think I'll hide them can solo it
[01:12:52] like I'm not even kidding I think I'll
[01:12:53] hide them Nikita with no other
[01:12:54] characters can beat it in time I'm not
[01:12:56] kidding because you're spreading
[01:12:57] everything like I don't think it's
[01:12:59] actually gonna be that hard so like even
[01:13:00] if we have like the two other characters
[01:13:02] are Electro I think it'll be fun
[01:13:05] but we'll see
[01:13:10] wait what are the channel points let me
[01:13:13] look
[01:13:14] yo this is the most anyone has ever been
[01:13:18] in my shop 11 million points on doubting
[01:13:21] okay I have to try hard I might have to
[01:13:23] [ __ ] whip out the shangling Bro
[01:13:25] dolphin 119 voted with 250k
[01:13:29] [ __ ] oh wait I know the way at least
[01:13:32] you're a believer
[01:13:33] I was about to ban you
[01:13:36] dude what the [ __ ] is this I almost want
[01:13:38] to scam you guys what the [ __ ] is this
[01:13:41] I actually have to try hard okay I have
[01:13:43] to try hard I need to [ __ ] Focus I
[01:13:44] have a playlist that I made just for
[01:13:45] this okay I have to focus everyone shut
[01:13:47] up everyone shut up we're playing child
[01:13:48] because I'm loyal if I want to be cringe
[01:13:50] I can freeze first half shangling second
[01:13:52] half but I'm not cringe so we're gonna
[01:13:54] play Xiao
[01:13:56] what the [ __ ] do I play second half
[01:13:58] you need dendro and you want either
[01:14:00] Electro or cryo oh sorry Electro pirate
[01:14:03] ideally Pyro
[01:14:04] oh we might have to [ __ ] [ __ ]
[01:14:06] shangling I just I hate it's all it's
[01:14:08] always strangling
[01:14:12] towel
[01:14:15] well if I put like
[01:14:18] yo hear me out we probably want a Healer
[01:14:21] right so I don't skill issue what if I
[01:14:22] play this team yo unironically I know it
[01:14:25] looks like dog [ __ ] but listen dude
[01:14:28] unironically because we don't want to
[01:14:30] die if I have no healer right
[01:14:34] dude listen
[01:14:40] I actually think it would work
[01:14:42] is it Jeff is a doubter wait is he
[01:14:58] okay granted we could also play Thomas
[01:15:01] I never thought I would do that first
[01:15:03] try though
[01:15:05] like we could do like ayato
[01:15:08] Thomas
[01:15:11] and then probably a Healer because I
[01:15:13] don't trust this
[01:15:22] um
[01:15:24] would probably just be better right
[01:15:28] but then we go to national team and this
[01:15:30] is what I said this is good
[01:15:38] why does he think you need dendro you
[01:15:39] don't need dendril but I assume it it's
[01:15:41] like dendro's really good against
[01:15:42] Thunder Mountain but it's really good
[01:15:43] against uh Hydro Herald and it's good
[01:15:46] against Baptist like that is just good
[01:15:47] against everything I guess you don't
[01:15:49] need it though but like you're
[01:15:50] definitely good against everything so
[01:15:51] why the [ __ ] wouldn't you
[01:15:57] get shot am I being cringe on playing
[01:16:00] shangling or am I being a giga chat or
[01:16:02] playing Thomas
[01:16:04] I thought you're gonna try hard uh true
[01:16:06] maybe I should play Shang wing
[01:16:10] [ __ ]
[01:16:12] doubters are saying Tomah Believers are
[01:16:14] saying shangling
[01:16:18] I also don't like shot without Bennett
[01:16:19] like I think Xiao doesn't need Bennett
[01:16:21] at all like I don't think Sean needs
[01:16:22] better but I think my damage numbers are
[01:16:24] so big with Bennett that it makes me
[01:16:26] happy
[01:16:29] honestly I could probably play Daya you
[01:16:31] guys think I'm joking but I actually
[01:16:32] think I could play this theme
[01:16:34] um
[01:16:39] we need a Healer here I don't want to
[01:16:41] risk dying so we'd probably run
[01:16:47] do
[01:16:51] do do do do do do do do do do do do do
[01:16:54] do do
[01:17:20] okay I think we're doing this
[01:17:24] but I don't know who our last slot is I
[01:17:26] actually don't know but we're definitely
[01:17:28] doing this I think
[01:17:30] okay these characters are geared
[01:17:33] these are also geared no Toma isn't
[01:17:37] cure no no
[01:17:42] baiju baiju is not a bad idea
[01:17:44] but I just actually not about a deal
[01:17:46] because we get healing from his skill
[01:17:59] yo how are we gonna kill the Thunderman
[01:18:01] if though this doesn't even do damage no
[01:18:04] we need more damage dude Tomah does not
[01:18:07] kill the [ __ ] Tomah does not kill the
[01:18:09] Thunderman if there's no way he kills it
[01:18:12] there's actually no way he kills it
[01:18:15] like what the [ __ ] is totally gonna do
[01:18:17] against it
[01:18:19] he does
[01:18:21] no I don't trust that I don't trust that
[01:18:24] I'll hide them as the flex lot
[01:18:27] you can bloom it I mean I know you like
[01:18:29] I know you can just nahida and [ __ ] but
[01:18:31] like
[01:18:41] don't underestimate virgin you're a
[01:18:43] doubter why are you saying a bird will
[01:18:45] be fine as a [ __ ] doubter
[01:18:55] stop avoiding him yeah [ __ ] I'm
[01:18:59] not playing your email I guess this [ __ ]
[01:19:07] wait is this so this is the same Baptist
[01:19:09] as the Overworld right but I thought the
[01:19:11] Baptist was
[01:19:13] uh a pyro thing
[01:19:16] it's pyro cryo Hydra right yeah flood
[01:19:20] flame Frost yeah that makes sense okay
[01:19:22] so we would need
[01:19:24] yeah we have okay yeah all right sure
[01:19:26] let me um I just want a gear Tomah
[01:19:28] Thomas my gear
[01:19:35] [Music]
[01:19:40] no we're playing [ __ ] Tomo
[01:19:44] bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum
[01:19:56] [Music]
[01:19:58] oh my God oh my God oh my God oh my God
[01:20:03] oh my God
[01:20:15] but he's on five gilded the hell I kind
[01:20:19] of need some critterage for five no
[01:20:21] we're at [ __ ] we're at 23 crit rate
[01:20:25] yeah
[01:20:27] I have no good rate
[01:20:29] [Music]
[01:20:58] all right should be fine
[01:21:04] okay I think we're good I'll hide things
[01:21:06] on [ __ ] black Cliff though so let's
[01:21:07] change my autism
[01:21:28] 103 230. relatable oh good rank one I
[01:21:31] thought no big deal no big deal no big
[01:21:33] deal you know me you know me no big deal
[01:21:34] you know me you know me I'll be here all
[01:21:36] night guys no no big deal
[01:21:38] no big deal
[01:21:41] oh did I say I'll hyphoon whatever I
[01:21:43] though
[01:21:44] same [ __ ]
[01:21:47] wait try and level it now dude [ __ ] is
[01:21:49] burst uh actually his burst is important
[01:21:52] it gives you normal attack damage and
[01:21:54] it's
[01:21:57] all right is shot geared
[01:21:59] cool I'm ready wait wait wait am I
[01:22:02] playing John John Lee [ __ ] I almost said
[01:22:04] John Lee I'm playing Jeong Lee or Dale
[01:22:06] because if I want to be funny I can play
[01:22:08] Daya but if I want to win and not scam
[01:22:11] Believers I play Shangri
[01:22:14] but I feel like it's griefing
[01:22:20] I feel like it's griefing if I play
[01:22:22] there
[01:22:23] because then everything really talks why
[01:22:25] the [ __ ] do you play Dale
[01:22:33] dude surely I don't die if I have
[01:22:35] Bennett and they are there's no way that
[01:22:37] consecrated B uh yeah I'm probably gonna
[01:22:39] die okay maybe Sean I believe in your
[01:22:41] Mister socks thanks man
[01:22:43] I believe in you chase your dreams
[01:22:50] foreign
[01:23:10] you will die even with a strong lead bro
[01:23:13] what there is no way
[01:23:15] I feel like John needs a cheat code
[01:23:16] that's why I didn't even gear him I was
[01:23:18] like I don't need the gears on Lee
[01:23:19] because I'm not gonna play them
[01:23:22] why do you guys think I'm gonna die with
[01:23:23] Zhang Lee bro he's [ __ ] what yeah I'm
[01:23:26] not gonna die why do you guys think I'm
[01:23:28] gonna die oh
[01:23:30] you guys know who I am play a good team
[01:23:33] I am playing a good team level one
[01:23:35] weapon yeah it doesn't matter
[01:24:04] foreign
[01:24:21] Believers are cooked
[01:24:27] wait okay before we go wait who's our
[01:24:29] last lot I don't know who our last
[01:24:30] thought is I need to decide before I
[01:24:31] [ __ ] go make sure they're geared who
[01:24:34] the [ __ ] is our last slot we're playing
[01:24:36] okay I'm not gonna like a chat [ __ ] you
[01:24:37] chat we're playing ayato Thomas nahida
[01:24:42] ayato Thomas nahida first time I've
[01:24:44] watched your streaming what's up your
[01:24:46] life welcome back bro
[01:24:48] I don't think we need a Healer but I'm
[01:24:50] gonna bring one just because everyone's
[01:24:51] like oh my God I literally died in the
[01:24:52] abyss 86 times and now I want to cry
[01:24:56] so we'll probably bring a Healer
[01:25:03] good new kokomi
[01:25:05] a second Hydro you're burning
[01:25:13] hmm
[01:25:14] foreign

[01:25:34] clear the frost fall with only Thomas
[01:25:36] Shirley right
[01:25:44] yo
[01:25:45] yo what if we bring cookie you think
[01:25:49] Gucci would help I feel like cookie
[01:25:50] would help
[01:25:57] because if not we do like
[01:26:00] Toma shangling
[01:26:11] nah we'll be fine I think kooky's okay
[01:26:14] drop Tomo we don't need to drop Tomah
[01:26:19] I think we got a cookie
[01:26:29] I don't think cookies better than kokomi
[01:26:32] though well Cookie's better for the
[01:26:33] cryoshield
[01:26:38] foreign
[01:26:46] scared dude there is there is 11 million
[01:26:49] Channel points doubting me I don't want

[01:29:27] doubter
[01:29:32] I did Moto Pardo it didn't work okay
[01:29:34] that has to be a skill issue
[01:29:37] if we do another pyro we're playing
[01:29:39] burning [ __ ] we're playing
[01:29:40] burning we're playing burning if we go
[01:29:42] another pyro we're playing burning kooky

[01:38:51] second try second try same team okay
[01:38:52] low-key though that was good
[01:38:55] that was actually good it's unlucky
[01:38:57] like we've we played perfectly it's not
[01:38:59] lucky
[01:39:02] play perfectly why am I paying off are
[01:39:04] mods asleep
[01:39:12] oh my God this is 1.4 million Channel

[01:39:20] on my on on everything I've ever known
[01:39:22] we're winning
[01:39:25] dude we're like What three seconds off
[01:39:27] and I didn't know what the the floor was
[01:39:28] so what we do is we don't
[01:39:32] wait actually how could I play that
[01:39:33] better
[01:39:34] I could have first half better second
[01:39:36] half I kind of could enough
[01:39:40] you gave up too early no I didn't
[01:39:43] those memories it's so dark
[01:39:47] Tomah isn't enough pyro no he is he
[01:39:50] actually is you'll see
[01:39:54] you stalled on the last guy yeah but we
[01:39:56] were cryo debuffed so we're like slow
[01:40:01] stamina yeah actually unironically save
[01:40:04] stamina
[01:40:05] okay good take
[01:40:07] okay running back running back running
[01:40:08] back new gambo running back
[01:40:11] looking good no she's not
[01:40:16] if anything shangling is
[01:40:18] Corner Camp do their cryo ones run to
[01:40:21] you probably right but sometimes I feel
[01:40:23] like they just dance and shoot [ __ ] on
[01:40:24] you
[01:40:29] bomb bomb
[01:40:36] more ER on Toma maybe he's not like only
[01:40:39] and he's not like 200 is oh maybe not
[01:40:41] actually yeah maybe we do need more all
[01:40:44] right running back surely we got it this
[01:40:45] time surely
[01:40:50] wait I left yo why is it two minutes for
[01:40:52] the doubters whatever I'm gonna start
[01:40:54] because I don't want to wait but yeah
[01:40:55] Raquel takes for six months
[01:40:59] easy win
[01:41:09] is this bad because the other ones are
[01:41:11] in the middle
[01:41:18] yeah maybe you stay in the middle here
[01:41:20] because this is kind of bad Loki want to
[01:41:23] reset but I feel like that'd be cheating
[01:41:24] so I shouldn't
[01:41:29] I mean now we know I guess but
[01:41:32] you know live and learn live laugh
[01:41:33] Lament
[01:41:36] stay in the middle like you a little I
[01:41:40] play the fiddle
[01:41:42] bad at riddles
[01:41:57] can I get my shoulders okay
[01:42:10] all right
[01:42:16] yeah let me think
[01:42:19] I told my instantly to get the most
[01:42:22] energy on him back
[01:42:28] then nahida
[01:42:30] Ito sure okay for the second dudes do I
[01:42:33] go in the middle or I'm asking myself
[01:42:35] not shot do I go in the middle or did I
[01:42:37] run here and expect them to group
[01:42:41] I kind of don't trust it I kind of want
[01:42:43] to go in the middle I could like lure
[01:42:45] though I could do this and then like
[01:42:46] walk over here
[01:42:53] but I kind of wanna
[01:43:13] oh I guess the uh the best Mages could
[01:43:16] teleport
[01:43:17] but I don't want to do that
[01:43:20] I don't want to risk it I kind of want
[01:43:21] to start here like what if okay you know
[01:43:23] the best way to help her right what if I
[01:43:24] go here and then they don't teleport
[01:43:26] what if I go here and then they just
[01:43:27] they say [ __ ] you and they don't what
[01:43:29] then what then am I allowed to reset
[01:43:31] what happens
[01:44:12] I know I don't even have faith in myself
[01:44:14] anymore let me think
[01:44:16] okay I think I think I know what I'm
[01:44:18] doing
[01:44:22] [Music]
[01:44:35] I need to catch energy here okay this
[01:44:39] game sucks

[01:45:28] fine the hydro line should be easy so it
[01:45:30] doesn't matter
[01:45:31] wait that was another cryo oh that might
[01:45:34] matter actually Leon Thomas energy
[01:45:38] well I didn't get any energy that is
[01:45:40] awkward
[01:45:42] that is awkward
[01:45:44] okay this was a little bit of a skill
[01:45:47] issue don't die okay I died sorry okay
[01:45:49] kinda my bad kind of the team sucks but
[01:45:53] you guys also said virgin would be good

[01:46:13] that's what we're gonna do uh we're
[01:46:15] actually gonna play rational
[01:46:17] because Ryden okay
[01:46:20] Kaka
[01:46:21] that was unfortunate
[01:46:24] but we should be fine I just don't have
[01:46:27] my writing gear because I think I'm
[01:46:28] gonna play right in I could play Childs
[01:46:31] maybe just play Child no no [ __ ] child
[01:46:33] that's useless

[01:47:11] you don't count the other tries it is
[01:47:12] our first try

[01:57:28] swap
[01:57:34] I can't afford any more bandages
[01:57:37] that doesn't count that wasn't the death
[01:57:38] dude I died from full HP how is that a
[01:57:41] death how like like oh oh actually
[01:57:44] actually our characters weren't geared
[01:57:45] no no I said I said I said the only way
[01:57:49] we can retry for free listen to me when
[01:57:51] I speak the only way we could who
[01:57:53] [ __ ] redeemed the prediction [ __ ] you
[01:57:55] [ __ ] mod not I'm kidding but it was
[01:57:57] probably the draft so I can [ __ ] talk
[01:57:58] him it was another mod your work is
[01:58:00] appreciated I love you it was the Jeff
[01:58:01] terrible mod listen here's why I said we
[01:58:04] can retry for free if our characters
[01:58:05] aren't geared you're gonna be like zox
[01:58:07] your characters were geared no we
[01:58:08] weren't why would our Bennett not be on
[01:58:10] HP healing bonus if we're gonna cause
[01:58:12] Bennett died so if Bennett was on HP he
[01:58:14] wouldn't have died true true if that it
[01:58:16] was on HP he wouldn't have died true
[01:58:20] so technically we weren't geared
[01:58:22] technically we weren't geared
[01:58:24] technically we weren't geared
[01:58:29] is the Jeff a real one

[02:21:45] the real word is not that this is hard
[02:21:46] it's that it's unfair and unfun well the
[02:21:49] thing is the hoyo did like the
[02:21:51] definition of heart is just more HP and
[02:21:54] more annoying enemies which kind of
[02:21:56] doesn't
[02:21:57] it's not really what we mean when we ask
[02:21:59] for better end game or harder end game
[02:22:01] or Co-op or whatever the [ __ ] uh where
[02:22:03] the [ __ ] is the star rails thing
[02:22:06] [Music]
[02:22:15] the crowd feels painful yeah it is
[02:22:19] granted like like
[02:22:22] I think
[02:22:28] yeah it's like doable but you need to
[02:22:30] play like pretty restricted uh there's
[02:22:33] only like a certain amount of Team
[02:22:34] columns that can work for it so like if
[02:22:36] you main like you're like oh I really
[02:22:37] like like [ __ ] nilu ganyu or some
[02:22:39] [ __ ] right and like usually use them for
[02:22:41] the abyss it might be harder I got all
[02:22:43] the granted freeze is pretty good it
[02:22:44] seems but
[02:22:45] yeah where the [ __ ] is this trailer bro
[02:22:47] how am I not finding it
[02:22:51] because on link it I don't know I can
[02:22:53] find it

[02:23:25] okay I got it
[02:23:33] wait look at this like [ __ ] like
[02:23:34] ratio
[02:23:40] [Music]

[02:23:51] [Music]
[02:23:56] as for Missions
[02:23:58] I can do this to make sleep oh wait it's
[02:24:02] gonna slabs whatever
[02:24:04] let's get this over with
[02:24:07] the song actually really good it's
[02:24:09] interesting let's see just a couple of
[02:24:13] small fries wait is that actually the
[02:24:16] correct um grammar is it a couple of
[02:24:18] small fry wouldn't it be fries or is it
[02:24:20] like a small fry like a batch of like
[02:24:22] fries that you're like frying like a
[02:24:23] small
[02:24:30] dude just watch I'm sorry I'm sorry
[02:24:34] [Music]
[02:24:38] a fry is a school of fish
[02:24:42] oh that's whoa whoa what was that wait
[02:24:44] I'm going back
[02:24:48] warm-ups over that's really sick
[02:24:53] that's pretty cool
[02:24:54] [Music]
[02:25:02] and why do low levels make the most
[02:25:05] noise
[02:25:07] I don't know what the [ __ ] is this
[02:25:10] [Music]
[02:25:11] what is she doing I'm back in a century
[02:25:24] that's pretty cool
[02:25:32] shot would you turn her in
[02:25:36] where do you turn around and choose
[02:25:40] that dude that's 51
[02:25:43] so oh my God that's so many zero like
[02:25:45] billion I don't know I can't count nine
[02:25:47] zeros is billion right three six
[02:25:50] nine and then yeah so yeah a lot 5.1
[02:25:54] whatever the [ __ ] that is
[02:26:00] thumb
[02:26:04] no I can ask Asta for 10 times that
[02:26:07] amount bro Asta is not giving you
[02:26:09] anything
[02:26:19] not gonna lie I hate that gamer
[02:26:21] aesthetic
[02:26:22] uh I think okay I think the animations
[02:26:25] are cool
[02:26:27] like I think this looks really well done
[02:26:29] I don't gravitate towards characters
[02:26:32] that are like diva
[02:26:35] but I think the animations are really
[02:26:37] clean so I like her
[02:26:39] why do low levels make the most noise
[02:26:47] [Music]
[02:26:50] century
[02:26:51] [Music]
[02:26:54] no damage I can't
[02:27:03] that's cool good trailer
[02:27:09] why does she look kind of like bronia
[02:27:10] I'm pretty sure it's like an alternate
[02:27:11] version of Brony or some [ __ ] but don't
[02:27:13] quote me on that because I [ __ ] spam
[02:27:15] spacebar and don't read but I'm pretty
[02:27:16] sure it is she playing's endless Zone
[02:27:19] zero
[02:27:21] how's this
[02:27:23] yes she is yeah
[02:27:30] okay chat we are now going to play wait
[02:27:34] try wait wait what should I play uh
[02:27:36] Kettle what a clear shell I wanted to do
[02:27:37] four star teams but I feel like my shot
[02:27:38] needs a clear like my shot did well
[02:27:40] though like he did good it wasn't his
[02:27:42] fault that we lost second half
[02:27:44] I wonder if maybe maybe Thomas could
[02:27:46] have cleared
[02:27:48] I feel like it wasn't his fault
[02:27:55] mind showing your kitchen build okay we
[02:27:57] were on foliar incision but this
[02:28:00] it's pretty good we have a good thing
[02:28:01] for TF because you strong box it right
[02:28:03] so we have like force like we just
[02:28:04] strong boxed it and then we have like
[02:28:06] pretty good artifacts like pretty insane
[02:28:08] artifact I'm not gonna lie our kitchen's
[02:28:10] pretty insane
[02:28:11] she's C1 I don't know why I activated
[02:28:14] the first one but is what it is
[02:28:17] only level eight town Stars probably
[02:28:19] level them but
[02:28:31] oh mine's dog should damage for some
[02:28:33] reason just go for emblem
[02:28:35] why is attack so low but crit so high
[02:28:37] because we're playing uh
[02:28:39] this sword gives us damage based on our
[02:28:41] em so we're on like a lot of em [ __ ]
[02:28:43] well it's not even that much but we
[02:28:45] don't even have attack sounds or on the
[02:28:46] M sounds so it's like it doesn't matter
[02:28:51] anyways
[02:28:52] who have to clear again
[02:28:56] uh but yeah for this Syncro thing just
[02:28:58] go [ __ ] four emblem and then go so
[02:29:01] you you don't need that much ER on him
[02:29:03] like a lot of synchros just stack ER and
[02:29:06] then you don't do a lot of damage so you
[02:29:07] kind of just need to go like
[02:29:08] constellations help Town levels help and
[02:29:10] then after that it's just crit
[02:29:14] maybe go like if you don't need socks or
[02:29:16] don't go stocks or like go offensive
[02:29:17] weapon if you can if you have enough VR
[02:29:19] if not go sacrify
[02:29:22] okay let's clear it with Xiao
[02:29:24] and then we'll do four star teams
[02:29:26] music's back on
[02:29:27] ciao first off which we play second half
[02:29:29] chat I want to play for manifestation
[02:29:32] and for these like I feel like tanari is
[02:29:35] probably decent but he I feel like what
[02:29:37] the [ __ ] would we do like here because
[02:29:39] we want to have a pyro
[02:29:42] unless we play burning but I don't play
[02:29:43] [ __ ] burning
[02:29:49] I don't want to watch you but I want
[02:29:51] drops bro
[02:29:54] that's kind of [ __ ] up
[02:29:56] to Luke
[02:30:00] retro version yo okay I'm being dead ass
[02:30:04] if there's ever an abyss for retro
[02:30:06] version it's this one like I'm not even
[02:30:09] kidding if there ever was a place to
[02:30:12] play this team it would be this Abyss
[02:30:18] this would be like the the
[02:30:22] dude scenario for the Luke
[02:30:25] I'm trying it I'm trying it
[02:30:28] do you guys think I'm [ __ ] joking I'm
[02:30:30] trying
[02:30:41] I wish I had an em sounds but
[02:30:43] ease what it is
[02:31:03] I like the difficulty based on multiple
[02:31:05] waves of enemies cause it makes it
[02:31:07] really hard but the one shot equals hard
[02:31:10] mentality is so bad and painful not to
[02:31:13] mention when you are in high ping like
[02:31:14] me I agree I agree no that's like it
[02:31:18] especially for like a mobile game
[02:31:20] okay I don't like that argument of
[02:31:22] mobile game because it's like then they
[02:31:23] refuse to make it harder so I'm gonna
[02:31:25] not use that but I do think that the
[02:31:28] haha you just got one-shotted on the
[02:31:30] second half have fun retrying is kind of
[02:31:33] not fun
[02:31:35] so I do agree with that
[02:31:39] that's pretty good
[02:31:45] okay this is our Luke we're gonna play
[02:31:48] deluke your lawn Yolanda's thing Joe
[02:31:50] chat this thing show is more Hydra but
[02:31:53] we could do we could do yolan kokomi and
[02:31:55] then that should be enough High drop
[02:32:03] and then Hydro
[02:32:05] um what is it called Layla resonance
[02:32:08] with how dude I'm [ __ ] forgetting
[02:32:09] gentian terms I'm washed up but yeah
[02:32:11] Hydro resonance should help us up uh
[02:32:13] help us out a lot
[02:32:20] laughs
[02:32:25] how's things for more High drop he's
[02:32:27] more High drop also have C6 thing shows
[02:32:29] it's even more
[02:32:30] it's okay I like c0 is pretty close uh
[02:32:32] unless you have CTL on
[02:32:34] but then C6 is better well even without
[02:32:37] it he's better but
[02:32:42] C6 it becomes a lot more
[02:32:53] running double hydro and nahida which
[02:32:55] should be good particle Jen I'm kind of
[02:32:58] doubting myself I might go a little bit
[02:32:59] more ER just to be safe 16 here that
[02:33:02] should be enough boom
[02:33:04] foreign
[02:33:16] I just hit my desk in the hutau Knight
[02:33:18] lab went on
[02:33:25] 25k HP on I mean we have uh hydrogen so
[02:33:27] it'll be over 30. it's fine I don't
[02:33:29] think it's worth going Hydro HP circlet
[02:33:35] uh yeah I think we're ready right Deluxe
[02:33:38] geared yeah should be good
[02:33:44] wait Josh should I play Daya I really
[02:33:46] want to play Dale

[02:35:09] nine star with the Luke team second half
[02:35:11] and first half we have Daya what are the
[02:35:13] odds I'm thinking like
[02:35:15] I'm thinking like 16 percent

[02:39:54] thing I all I want for Christmas is to
[02:39:58] play the game
[02:40:01] rebalance
[02:40:08] this is
[02:40:10] Outdoors
[02:40:19] dude
[02:40:26] like the team's damage is enough I just
[02:40:29] I can't play
[02:40:33] okay
[02:40:34] it was winnable it was winnable but like
[02:40:41] but it was winnable I just couldn't play
[02:40:43] the game
[02:40:47] all right
[02:40:49] we'll actually use there this time
[02:40:52] wait one of them didn't teleport
[02:40:57] yeah I mean
[02:41:03] bro
[02:41:08] spend more time getting hit I can't
[02:41:28] did I not go far enough what the [ __ ]
[02:41:31] just happened
[02:41:35] go further but the thing is I want to be
[02:41:37] in the middle because the next wave is
[02:41:39] in the middle
[02:41:41] so it's like I want to keep them like
[02:41:43] kind of as close to the middle as
[02:41:44] possible while still grouping them oh my
[02:41:46] God excuse me
[02:41:57] they actually counter show
[02:42:09] Lament
[02:42:15] I've been crit I know he's gonna [ __ ]
[02:42:17] float for six years
[02:42:20] I should hit all three
[02:42:35] yeah we're actually getting nine started
[02:42:37] there I think
[02:42:41] yeah
[02:42:43] cool
[02:42:49] [ __ ] hate this floor man
[02:42:56] age
[02:42:57] [Music]
[02:43:16] thank you
[02:43:26] I missed two of my E's didn't go off
[02:43:28] because getting [ __ ] [ __ ]
[02:43:31] here
[02:43:51] expires it expired
[02:43:57] I lost my jellyfish
[02:44:17] [Music]
[02:44:20] I think enemies should drain stamina so
[02:44:23] you can't Dodge and then they should
[02:44:24] watch on you so like because there's
[02:44:26] dominoes drained so you can't Dodge it's
[02:44:28] actually cool that they can watch on you
[02:44:30] I think that's a cool mechanic that uh
[02:44:32] should be implemented into more video
[02:44:34] games in my opinion that's just my
[02:44:36] opinion though I just I think that's a
[02:44:37] cool thing
[02:44:38] I think that's a cool thing uh uh maybe
[02:44:41] we should run on the shield character
[02:44:42] but if we run like there's no Hydro like
[02:44:46] I mean if we're on like baiju
[02:44:48] then we probably have too much like not
[02:44:50] enough hydro and then we'll be like
[02:44:52] burning
[02:44:54] you didn't have speed boots
[02:45:02] bro
[02:45:06] okay now he whoa he dug in place
[02:45:13] well worthless
[02:45:17] this is a disaster
[02:45:27] that's a disaster
[02:45:36] fine
[02:45:46] boring
[02:45:48] he will conquer it
[02:45:51] here
[02:45:53] worthless
[02:45:55] care
[02:45:59] okay okay okay
[02:46:13] this
[02:46:15] what
[02:46:16] we are not three cylinders I don't even
[02:46:17] want to make them teleport anymore I
[02:46:19] don't care we are not doing this
[02:46:30] might as well use this to try some [ __ ]
[02:46:32] so we're gonna try some [ __ ]
[02:46:38] we're gonna try a stamina management
[02:46:40] rotation where we use zero stamina
[02:46:44] I'm not allowed to dodge
[02:46:46] no matter what nope not loud not loud
[02:46:51] ways to the wicked
[02:46:54] a brush maneuver hold the line still not
[02:46:57] loud yeah
[02:47:03] this is stamina management classes
[02:47:09] on your lawn
[02:47:12] okay this is not gonna work
[02:47:16] um I tried to swap the nahito but then
[02:47:17] realized my teeth is on three
[02:47:21] okay
[02:47:23] [Music]
[02:47:25] so far we are dying
[02:47:28] well at least we're managing our stamina
[02:47:30] at least
[02:47:32] okay
[02:47:34] I have an idea
[02:47:35] maybe we bring our Shield but then it's
[02:47:37] like dude we don't have enough Hydra if
[02:47:39] you bring a shield and if we bring baiju
[02:47:40] we don't have enough dendro
[02:47:43] maybe no the Luke
[02:47:49] um
[02:47:52] their freeze comp is pretty good
[02:48:04] do I think nahida baiju would be too
[02:48:06] much

[02:57:11] fault yeah
[02:57:12] if my cause was on crit this would clear

[02:58:50] randomly
[02:58:51] did it randomly started [ __ ] I
[02:58:54] guess that's actually just unlucky
[02:58:57] I blame him
[02:59:00] I don't know what happened
[02:59:05] typical sumeru citizen
[02:59:10] I might die here is what it is I've

[02:59:29] I swap inside of Bennett Circle I Dash
[02:59:33] inside of Bennett Circle guess what
[02:59:35] Bennett Circle no longer heals
[02:59:46] implements
[02:59:50] worthless
[02:59:51] oh my God lament oh my God I'm lamenting
[03:00:03] it's fine
[03:00:04] it's fine it's fine it's fine
[03:00:32] okay okay
[03:00:37] let's Light It Up
[03:00:41] dude what is happening
[03:00:44] say Wallah right now bro
[03:00:59] foreign
[03:01:03] foreign
[03:01:39] yeah we need another Hydra on this team
[03:01:42] usually like I know why we went wrong
[03:01:44] with you for like the shield of chip but
[03:01:45] we need a Hydra Shield
[03:01:54] oh we don't have a Healer
[03:02:07] gather
[03:02:10] Here Comes
[03:02:19] yes can I vaporize one hit one I draw
[03:02:23] one Vape bro we're playing [ __ ]
[03:02:25] burning yo you need two hydros in this
[03:02:27] team but
[03:02:29] Jean Lee helps for this Flora at least
[03:02:31] that's fine
[03:02:35] [Music]
[03:02:43] yeah I didn't get the Fab
[03:02:58] stabilize I mean we stuck near this but
[03:03:08] pretty good here it's just you'd want
[03:03:10] two hydros usually but
[03:03:14] also okay to be fair to be fair I did
[03:03:19] say I was gonna play the Luke Singh true
[03:03:21] nahida and then I chose yolan so true C6
[03:03:24] would have been more hydro and I meant
[03:03:26] to choosing Joe but even then I think
[03:03:28] you still want two hydros
[03:03:33] really remember
[03:03:36] but where are those like till after the
[03:03:39] [ __ ] burning frogs
[03:03:49] well that was a second team we cleared
[03:03:51] up
[03:03:52] what do you think in China four stars
[03:03:53] now
[03:04:04] okay I've actually been like thinking
[03:04:06] about four star teams there's a lot of
[03:04:09] [ __ ] teams
[03:04:11] there's I mean like that's not true like
[03:04:13] my point is like there's
[03:04:16] I have a lot of ideas
[03:04:18] and I don't know which to choose
[03:04:25] so here are my thoughts
[03:04:29] for first off I was thinking of like
[03:04:31] maybe Beto official Quicken
[03:04:34] I think this is a really good team I
[03:04:36] also think we could play uh well hyper
[03:04:39] them obviously works too but I think
[03:04:40] Quicken would be good I also think taser
[03:04:43] like just like super or uh solid taser
[03:04:46] or salad with sucrose would be good
[03:04:49] and then probably like National second
[03:04:51] uh but I was also thinking of 16 18
[03:04:54] which is
[03:04:55] Kaya Rosario please play KU in begging
[03:05:02] but the only problem with 1618 is like
[03:05:13] honestly there shouldn't be any because
[03:05:15] we have two cryo two pyro it should [ __ ]
[03:05:18] up their Shields dude 1618 works every
[03:05:21] Abyss always no matter what it has never
[03:05:24] not worked ever
[03:05:26] and it's two free to play characters and
[03:05:28] then two other four stars
[03:05:33] so I think it should work
[03:05:38] although
[03:05:39] granted I assume that this team is
[03:05:42] better doing like Bennett
[03:05:46] shangling Singh show dendro but yeah
[03:05:54] no resistance Interruption okay true but
[03:05:57] the beauty of that team is that you're
[03:05:58] quick swapping so you're literally
[03:06:00] invulnerable for your whole rotation
[03:06:02] except like five seconds
[03:06:04] which yeah you might get [ __ ] during
[03:06:06] those five seconds but
[03:06:08] you know
[03:06:17] that's not that much time
[03:06:20] dude this drains me I can't even like
[03:06:22] talk
[03:06:23] yeah this is not bad
[03:06:25] I think we [ __ ] him up a bit
[03:06:29] um
[03:06:31] but he looks good Kyle is good
[03:06:33] Rosario two blizzard to the bus
[03:06:35] Deathmatch
[03:06:37] really good ratio but low ER but our
[03:06:39] Fabs on our Cosmos on [ __ ] our Kai is on
[03:06:41] five strangling and Bennett are geared
[03:06:44] and then our other team will be Beto
[03:06:46] official
[03:06:48] what Dedra character should we use MC or
[03:06:51] Kirara probably Kirara I'm not for Kira
[03:06:55] Kirara should be geared but let's make
[03:06:56] sure
[03:07:01] oh wait we want to put stop it on
[03:07:02] Bennett
[03:07:03] and then Kirara will go
[03:07:07] suck
[03:07:14] what about collie eye
[03:07:17] call the eye
[03:07:20] oh I'd rather these detrimpsy here
[03:07:25] when my alarm turned off let's back
[03:07:27] [Music]
[03:07:35] [Music]
[03:07:41] who took our [ __ ] feather someone
[03:07:43] joined our feather
[03:07:45] Ryden
[03:07:48] oh what the [ __ ] all right uh we're on
[03:07:51] the wrong Circle clearly yeah we're on
[03:07:53] the wrong circlet we'll go for the crit
[03:07:54] damage one
[03:07:59] wait I just realized something
[03:08:02] no way we're about to do a four star
[03:08:04] clear
[03:08:05] without playing Synchro surely
[03:08:08] something's up here surely something's
[03:08:10] not right if we do a four-star clear
[03:08:11] without Synchro
[03:08:29] foreign
[03:08:33] taser
[03:08:37] we could
[03:08:42] why does my supers have 140 crit damage
[03:08:52] wait shot
[03:08:54] we can surely we can deal with the
[03:08:56] Baptist pyro shield with double cryo
[03:08:58] right yeah I'm pretty sure
[03:09:00] should be fine but I haven't actually
[03:09:02] tried it yet
[03:09:17] oh
[03:09:20] my God
[03:09:27] all right let's let's look
[03:09:31] let's look so
[03:09:35] you guys are annoying but we'll be fine
[03:09:39] foreign
[03:09:46] so I think we for sure do
[03:09:49] Beto first half
[03:09:52] I think no matter what beta official is
[03:09:54] happening
[03:09:55] then second off this is happening for
[03:09:58] sure and then after that it's kind of
[03:09:59] flex
[03:10:31] is there a four-star deadro Catalyst not
[03:10:33] right of course or nahito win
[03:10:39] but actually
[03:10:41] but if we did this
[03:10:46] like unironically what if we did that
[03:10:49] foreign
[03:10:55] we might die though because they don't
[03:10:57] have a Healer so I'd rather do this or
[03:11:00] Kirara but
[03:11:02] or sucrose actually and then just [ __ ]
[03:11:04] it
[03:11:12] but I probably want a shield no healer I
[03:11:15] mean sing show Beto should be enough
[03:11:25] who's triggering the bloom it's
[03:11:27] electrocharged
[03:11:28] but it would be hard because we might
[03:11:30] get [ __ ]
[03:11:33] um
[03:11:38] so I would probably do Quicken I'd
[03:11:40] probably do like
[03:11:43] this and then either yao yao or Kirara I
[03:11:48] like the shield more than I like the
[03:11:49] healing but the healing is comfy
[03:11:56] it's not like that
[03:12:07] Shield yeah she does
[03:12:11] happy birthday
[03:12:38] Chad you think 1618 is gonna work or do
[03:12:40] we need to run a hydro
[03:12:43] surely we don't need a Hydra right I
[03:12:46] know I know there's a pyro Shield like I
[03:12:47] know
[03:12:56] I would say
[03:13:07] you ain't clearing
[03:13:10] what do you mean I ain't clearing
[03:13:14] oh
[03:13:25] like we'll be fine up until here I just
[03:13:28] don't know if we can break the Pyro
[03:13:29] Shield but even if it takes a while it's
[03:13:32] fine because this dude the Baptist is
[03:13:34] like easy
[03:13:35] thank you
[03:13:37] surely right
[03:13:55] one sec trap
[03:14:01] wait one second let me do it really fast
[03:14:03] I'll explain why later one sec
[03:14:22] okay I'm back
[03:14:25] I can't explain why yet but I will soon
[03:14:27] like tomorrow don't worry
[03:14:34] watching YouTube clips no I'm not I
[03:14:37] literally didn't even move I'm literally
[03:14:39] still here
[03:14:46] of the Japanese
[03:14:48] anyways let's go uh I think okay if you
[03:14:51] want to be like smart we could do this
[03:14:53] but then it's like
[03:14:55] then it's getting really close to
[03:14:57] national team and at that point we might
[03:14:58] as well just go like dendro and then
[03:14:59] it's like it might as well just National
[03:15:01] so let's uh let's let's just I kind of
[03:15:04] want to 16 18. if 16 18 doesn't work
[03:15:05] then my life is a lie
[03:15:08] where did I go wrong I lost a friend
[03:15:12] so let's try
[03:15:16] I've been awake for so long but it's
[03:15:18] fine I'm fueled by the abyss I think our
[03:15:19] yeah I I think after this Trail I'm
[03:15:22] gonna upload something and then tomorrow
[03:15:23] I do Abyss randomizer where we do like
[03:15:26] punishments with a wheel and then after
[03:15:28] that we do star rail
[03:15:32] let me restart the recording
[03:15:38] yeah I know cryo against hydroshield is
[03:15:40] fine the only thing is I don't know how
[03:15:42] it's gonna be against
[03:15:43] um what's the the the Pyro Baptist thing
[03:15:47] we might two star the 12-3 but if we do
[03:15:50] we can just try a different team
[03:15:51] okay
[03:15:53] ready ready
[03:16:01] foreign
[03:16:07] [Music]
[03:16:57] okay this was kind of bad at the end I
[03:16:59] kind of [ __ ] up some of this
[03:17:02] but it is what it is
[03:17:05] wait did I just

[03:19:22] a nice guy generally
[03:19:23] and I've given you a few passes but I've
[03:19:25] noticed an idiot in the chat why do you
[03:19:28] keep saying easy like I said this Abyss
[03:19:30] was easy I said it's easy for me because
[03:19:31] I'm talented and my artifacts are good

[03:20:08] only 21 songs bro it's a playlist just
[03:20:11] for this Abyss it's not our normal one

[03:20:43] I can't really Parry these guys because
[03:20:45] they don't attack me so it's like my my
[03:20:46] bedroom needs more energy than usual
[03:20:48] because I get zero [ __ ] parries
[03:20:51] but like there's not really much I can
[03:20:52] do about that but it's fine
[03:20:57] okay look at that [ __ ]

[03:21:40] let's do better
[03:21:48] I'm not waiting for the weapon
[03:21:52] teleport
[03:22:01] it's a little too late but all good
[03:22:03] okay
[03:22:06] no rest for the wicked
[03:22:30] Wings Of Darkness
[03:22:38] this is a lot better
[03:22:40] I missed my oh I have no denture out now
[03:22:42] actually I should get my burst back this
[03:22:43] one yep
[03:22:51] balls
[03:23:00] that was good but yeah it was good
[03:23:04] huh
[03:23:16] teamwork is DreamWorks
[03:23:22] ah that is not fun
[03:23:26] you can't run talk to five
[03:23:30] I don't freeze
[03:23:33] can I broadcast
[03:23:45] [Music]
[03:24:06] I want to see if we can I might die but
[03:24:10] good practice
[03:24:12] yeah
[03:24:15] oh this can't even pop yet
[03:24:19] free let's light it up
[03:24:22] yeah a lot of our characters get one
[03:24:24] shotted
[03:24:27] maybe Guyana is better here
[03:24:30] because damage isn't really the issue
[03:24:38] or Layla not Donna actually Donna gives
[03:24:41] yam probably better
[03:24:51] I mean realistically we just play
[03:24:53] Synchro DMC but
[03:24:57] I want to also gives stamina
[03:25:11] my name is yeah I think maybe
[03:25:15] um I think maybe down as the play wait
[03:25:17] why did that group them what am I doing
[03:25:18] honestly we could probably just do this
[03:25:24] animal
[03:25:25] s kind of sloppy but I don't care
[03:25:30] how did dendra not get on that guy
[03:25:42] so why did he go that way
[03:25:50] I think it's either sing show which is
[03:25:54] probably the right answer or we do diona
[03:25:58] but even think Joe will still get frozen
[03:26:00] or we'll still get one shot dead
[03:26:06] hmm
[03:26:09] maybe sing show DMC
[03:26:12] first thing show yeah yeah
[03:26:30] why the [ __ ] is yayo
[03:26:37] yes
[03:26:39] the [ __ ] is she on
[03:26:54] [ __ ]
[03:26:57] okay we're gonna take our nahita
[03:26:58] artifacts I guess although it doesn't
[03:27:00] really matter what we're on as long as I
[03:27:01] have crit but
[03:27:08] you know we'll take our KIRO artifacts I
[03:27:10] don't know what I'm saying
[03:27:12] go HP yeah let's just take care of
[03:27:13] artifacts
[03:27:22] instructor yeah that's not a bad idea I
[03:27:24] don't know if I have it in structure
[03:27:25] levels
[03:27:27] am I running a Healer in this team yeah
[03:27:28] Bennett and we could
[03:27:30] doesn't do much there unless we're
[03:27:32] actually burgeoning but I don't think we
[03:27:33] are
[03:27:37] yeah actually I'm down
[03:27:39] I'm actually down
[03:27:48] oh
[03:28:04] I don't want HP or ER I'm on five right
[03:28:07] actually
[03:28:10] I don't need healing sometimes I'll go
[03:28:12] ER anything doesn't [ __ ] matter
[03:28:14] because we have Bennett
[03:28:30] did I did gear before starting
[03:28:33] a million [ __ ] characters
[03:28:39] don't need to burst often either I know
[03:28:41] but like it's better than HP
[03:28:46] I don't know why I'm plus 16ing it
[03:28:48] though this is definitely a waste all
[03:28:50] good
[03:28:52] and then goblet will do offset
[03:28:56] uh
[03:28:57] uh yeah it doesn't have crate oh not bad
[03:29:00] actually
[03:29:03] okay
[03:29:06] Chad what are those this works I'm
[03:29:08] guessing 76.9418
[03:29:19] probably don't need socksword especially
[03:29:21] because we're fighting shields the whole
[03:29:22] time
[03:29:24] foreign
[03:29:41] though
[03:29:44] I think our Yolanda yeah I'll just go
[03:29:47] [ __ ] fast whatever
[03:29:49] it's always five every road leads back
[03:29:53] to five five also doesn't work against
[03:29:55] Shields but
[03:29:58] oh maybe we do go black dude I don't
[03:30:00] know
[03:30:06] yeah I think it's five
[03:30:14] but we're cheating we're taking the show
[03:30:15] sounds Pepe w
[03:30:28] same one sense
[03:30:34] yeah catching aggravate go based on sub
[03:30:36] stats
[03:30:38] usually people go em but like one
[03:30:40] they're pretty similar in sub stats it
[03:30:43] also depends on your team
[03:30:54] okay we're gonna play
[03:30:57] show
[03:31:01] Chang Ling
[03:31:08] please
[03:31:11] tell me why shangling
[03:31:15] is so op
[03:31:18] P she can vaporize
[03:31:22] with no ICD
[03:31:27] middle
[03:31:28] official
[03:31:30] kiwawa
[03:31:36] and that's gross
[03:31:38] wait I'm playing I'm so [ __ ] stupid
[03:31:42] haha let's remove all our Kirara
[03:31:44] artifacts for yao yao and then play
[03:31:46] kiraro ha ha
[03:31:49] hello
[03:31:55] please excuse my stupidity trap one
[03:31:57] second normal is done
[03:32:00] because I ended up giving Yaya
[03:32:02] instructor anyways so it's fine
[03:32:10] but yeah that needs more crit rate
[03:32:11] though
[03:32:12] wait what the [ __ ] covey's been stacking
[03:32:14] criterate secretly
[03:32:27] how the [ __ ] is she on Jay cutter
[03:32:39] Chad I want Kirara constellations
[03:32:43] I do man I just I do like I do
[03:32:49] that's it I only care about C4 and six
[03:32:51] but I think they're like pretty nice
[03:32:53] but I'm not pulling for C6 dude Hazel C6
[03:32:58] got me like C6 casual Loki on the down
[03:33:01] low
[03:33:02] that [ __ ] was not worth it
[03:33:09] granted Hazel still is my desktop
[03:33:11] background for those of you wondering
[03:33:14] he still is
[03:33:17] but anyways
[03:33:20] see where's the only one that matters
[03:33:22] yes for Den drop but I'm a big believer
[03:33:26] in in kiraris C6 because it makes her
[03:33:29] just a more valuable support especially
[03:33:30] if you play like Quicken or like let's
[03:33:32] say you play her with like
[03:33:34] tanari and then an electro character and
[03:33:36] then like Kazo or some [ __ ] or just like
[03:33:38] Electro cause or like whatever like
[03:33:39] you're buffing like a lot of elements
[03:33:41] you can build like dendro Electro or
[03:33:42] dendro Electro Nemo or like Electro
[03:33:45] Hydro
[03:33:46] now that's a pretty decent 12 like it's
[03:33:48] not like amazing but pretty good
[03:33:53] dude don't [ __ ] on 12 it's 5 12 times
[03:33:57] two that's 24. 12 is a dozen dozen
[03:34:00] donuts who says no it's a 12 donuts I
[03:34:03] wouldn't
[03:34:04] if you do that's kind of weird that's
[03:34:06] kind of weird
[03:34:10] it's not bad it's like nice it's not
[03:34:14] great it's not amazing that's nice for a
[03:34:17] four star from Subaru dude Dory C6 is
[03:34:20] like go [ __ ] yourself
[03:34:22] Dory C1 go [ __ ] yourself C2 go [ __ ]
[03:34:24] yourself C6 guess what go [ __ ] yourself
[03:34:29] hello zaj
[03:34:36] a dozen is 13. I almost banned you for
[03:34:39] being that dumb a dozen is not 13. a
[03:34:41] Baker's Dozen is 13 because the baker's
[03:34:43] like oh and gives you an extra one but a
[03:34:47] dozen is definitely 12.
[03:34:55] wait what the [ __ ] is happening to my
[03:34:56] team okay this
[03:34:58] this this and then here it's
[03:35:02] uh Kirara sucrose or sucrose I'll put
[03:35:06] your first Instagram
[03:35:08] s right
[03:35:09] all right cool what's up Carlo
[03:35:13] Bros American don't mind him what does
[03:35:15] that mean what does that mean
[03:35:20] didn't you get rid of Yaya's artifacts
[03:35:22] no she's on instructor
[03:35:24] do I want HP no we're playing Beto and
[03:35:27] Chang Ling so skip it
[03:35:29] skill helps official it kind of helps
[03:35:30] intro it kind of helps Beto if we Parry
[03:35:34] it's not that big of a deal but I don't
[03:35:36] think we need the HP
[03:35:38] so
[03:35:50] this uh this isn't as hard as the last
[03:35:52] one I think
[03:36:03] [Music]
[03:36:10] that [ __ ] was so dumb I had the Toyota
[03:36:12] Corollary
[03:36:14] [Music]
[03:36:20] sorry I don't I disagree but all good
[03:36:28] it's the first time I was able to get
[03:36:30] through Abyss 12. okay you either
[03:36:33] never tried
[03:36:34] or your teams like the two teams you
[03:36:37] decided to play every single Abyss
[03:36:39] happen to be really good right now
[03:36:41] there's no other explanation like unless
[03:36:43] you main you're like your two favorite
[03:36:45] characters are really good like you're
[03:36:46] like I [ __ ] ing love
[03:36:48] [ __ ] ayaka shangling or some [ __ ]
[03:36:50] like
[03:36:54] yeah it could depend on your teams
[03:36:59] Beto's really good right now
[03:37:02] all right let's go
[03:37:03] they're gonna dig right here
[03:37:28] oh
[03:37:32] ideal hoyo consumer okay true I gotta
[03:37:36] calm down
[03:37:37] yeah they dig if you don't look at them
[03:37:39] but I mean they also think if you do
[03:37:40] because I know if you go here they'll
[03:37:42] dig but I want them to stay in the
[03:37:43] middle because then the next wave is in
[03:37:44] the middle so I I think
[03:37:47] like this is the play
[03:37:50] but we only got two but then we can do
[03:37:52] this and then apply dendro and then
[03:37:54] burst
[03:37:55] and then wrong character
[03:37:57] [Music]
[03:37:58] let me get some energy on Vito boom boom
[03:38:02] Kirara apply that dangerous
[03:38:04] stroller [ __ ]
[03:38:15] a little scarf to convert the last run
[03:38:17] but it is what it is
[03:38:31] on who me me me

[03:38:50] room
[03:38:53] I feel like we already cleared out this
[03:38:54] time let's try I feel like this is uh a
[03:38:58] no group run hey what's up guys welcome
[03:39:00] to my no grouping enemies challenge okay
[03:39:02] uh
[03:39:04] that was pretty bad
[03:39:12] NBC what happened
[03:39:15] I'll start at three stocks I don't wait
[03:39:16] for five
[03:39:17] actually we can look at beta we'll wait
[03:39:19] for five
[03:39:22] respectfully though respectfully
[03:39:41] bring drop hard that's the wrong game
[03:39:46] [ __ ] it I'm not waiting I don't have my

[03:40:54] [Music]
[03:40:56] okay
[03:40:58] not terrible we've cleared faster in the
[03:41:00] past but
[03:41:03] it's fine actually this is pretty bad
[03:41:05] because I have to do another boost
[03:41:09] five
[03:41:10] opium
[03:41:21] windy plant and hyperbloom call that a

[03:59:44] okay low key
[03:59:47] Angling
[03:59:49] I'm out of the way
[03:59:51] for trying to
[03:59:54] memorize
[04:00:04] [Music]
[04:00:11] [Music]
[04:00:12] he's looking clear now he's worse than
[04:00:13] sucrose there
[04:00:22] I'm trying to use the Forester team
[04:00:24] we've cleared a few five star ones uh we
[04:00:26] could play
[04:00:31] sucrose look at this new taser like
[04:00:33] electrocharged
[04:00:34] I wonder if it would be better or worse
[04:00:39] then what the [ __ ] would you do second
[04:00:41] half
[04:00:56] frames are really nice
[04:00:59] by the way by trying to go
[04:01:04] 16 18 16 18 worked but we're getting
[04:01:07] [ __ ] like we're taking so much damage
[04:01:12] it was like hard to stay alive
[04:01:18] here like three times we're just playing
[04:01:20] a 4 30 now what do you mean
[04:01:26] we could do Diana Rosario Diana Kaya
[04:01:36] second half
[04:01:39] I mean it's the that's not really what
[04:01:41] matters though
[04:01:46] why is the song So looping okay I'm
[04:01:48] sorry
[04:01:53] but
[04:02:04] nah surely we're not that bad that we
[04:02:07] need diona surely we can run no diona
[04:02:12] and be fine
[04:02:27] subscribers no no okay this team okay
[04:02:30] this team with Diana before Rosario came
[04:02:32] out was
[04:02:34] uh
[04:02:35] was playable I remember like it would
[04:02:37] clear the the abyss it's not as good
[04:02:39] it's not as much cryo but it still
[04:02:41] worked
[04:02:42] because Kyle would be melting it's just
[04:02:44] Rosario wouldn't oh like Kyle would and
[04:02:47] then if if it's uh if shangling took
[04:02:49] over it's like who cares checking link
[04:02:50] took over
[04:02:52] but it's probably not enough for the
[04:02:54] Baptist Shield so I think this is better
[04:02:56] I don't know if we play sing to our
[04:02:58] dendro here but I'm not a tricycle
[04:03:13] we'll see

[04:27:17] well I'm at the benef
[04:27:20] I promise
[04:27:29] we got it we actually got it
[04:27:31] so what are my cooldowns
[04:27:39] all right technically 12 two weeks 659
[04:27:44] did because I didn't want to use my
[04:27:45] power NATO so my bad but
[04:27:47] still these are on the ones that matter
[04:27:50] I can read your 12-2 if you want
[04:27:53] barely actually did yes but but I think
[04:27:56] both of the teams
[04:27:58] so here's the thing
[04:28:00] I think both of the teams were good but
[04:28:02] ideally one of your two teams has a five
[04:28:04] star
[04:28:05] like
[04:28:06] the force Edge characters could both of
[04:28:08] them both of the teams worked but
[04:28:10] ideally one of the two has a five star
[04:28:12] like ideally like if you have like a
[04:28:14] high thumb or like like whatever the
[04:28:16] [ __ ] whoever you play ayaka [ __ ]
[04:28:18] Chang leg
[04:28:22] but it worked
[04:28:25] uh I don't know what someone I I saw a
[04:28:27] few Subs sorry I was like super focused
[04:28:29] uh
[04:28:31] someone gifted five I high Key Don't
[04:28:33] weld it nebula takes up four months I'm
[04:28:35] sorry uh Ellie takes the two hacks right
[04:28:37] there's a 16 at least a surprise
[04:28:40] wait let me see
[04:28:43] Louie this is
[04:28:48] unlock my I don't know who which one was
[04:28:50] today but both of you think this is what
[04:28:52] gets it oh good
[04:28:55] you are very funny on mute
[04:29:00] why would you say that like it cost you
[04:29:03] nothing to be nice nothing it's free

[04:29:10] can you even play anything
[04:29:12] bro I mean

[04:29:46] big Tonka T second half
[04:29:48] tanari brother
[04:29:58] try hotel Virgin
[04:30:04] we could
[04:30:16] wait that's actually a good theory
[04:30:19] what's that they wanted us to play TCG
[04:30:21] so they made this Abyss wait that's
[04:30:24] actually yo that's actually that's
[04:30:25] actually that has to be true
[04:30:30] that's actually a good tweet
[04:30:33] Maybe
[04:30:35] maybe they just maybe they made this
[04:30:40] Abyss
[04:30:41] because they wanted
[04:30:45] they made this Abyss so annoying because
[04:30:47] they wanted us to play TCG
[04:30:52] it all makes sense now

[04:34:10] we could play with me I haven't played
[04:34:12] her in a while
[04:34:15] but like she's it's like it's not like
[04:34:17] it's hard like you just [ __ ] Mash
[04:34:18] normal attack kill this thing Master
[04:34:20] always had to kill this thing and then
[04:34:22] second half is gonna be annoying but

[04:34:32] well I feel like you'd want another pyro
[04:34:34] second half wouldn't you
[04:34:37] because that seems annoying

[04:35:43] [ __ ] the ER build
[04:35:49] okay we need to go
[04:35:52] who's your best build character yoying
[04:35:55] me up
[04:35:56] unironically ioto like all right those
[04:35:58] always rank somewhere from rank 1 to
[04:36:00] rank 3 depending always so is just our
[04:36:04] best just it makes no sense like if if
[04:36:06] our Iota was ciao I would be super happy
[04:36:08] but it is what it is granted our show
[04:36:10] actually got better
[04:36:12] our shadow is decent but no
[04:36:25] you guys actually don't know how good my
[04:36:27] yomi is like you guys think I'm [ __ ]
[04:36:29] joking but look
[04:36:33] look let me get her let me get her
[04:36:50] oh yeah we cleared the Luke I forgot
[04:36:52] about that wait that was actually lit
[04:36:54] I'm so [ __ ] happy we clear with the
[04:36:55] Luke
[04:37:10] Play-Doh
[04:37:11] Baidu
[04:37:13] okay look at this
[04:37:15] look this is okay this is without the
[04:37:18] bonus criter we get right so it would be
[04:37:20] 87.6
[04:37:22] with a rust right no crit on the weapon
[04:37:25] 83 like 87 whatever the [ __ ] it would be
[04:37:27] 185 dude are yours actually insane
[04:37:36] yeah mod check [ __ ] you guys are
[04:37:39] like oh play mono pyro play Moto pyro
[04:37:41] and then you have to talk about the EM
[04:37:43] what are you talking about
[04:37:44] what are you talking about
[04:37:46] [ __ ] if I wanted to em I'd go em
[04:38:07] Ma
[04:38:15] uh yeah we don't have a rust though so
[04:38:17] we're gonna have to go harp because we
[04:38:19] don't actually have a rust like leveled
[04:38:21] I used to have one but aware
[04:38:23] that's fine
[04:38:37] sorry
[04:38:50] wait John what if I play Xiao first half
[04:38:55] without a circlet you think it's
[04:38:56] clearable
[04:38:57] ah gopio
[04:39:04] truly it is I feel like there's no way
[04:39:06] it isn't
[04:39:12] yeah but our Cosmos build is actually
[04:39:14] griefing
[04:39:18] but why I don't know to remove our hyper
[04:39:21] investment
[04:39:29] oh we could try ayaka everyone's been
[04:39:31] saying to play Aiko but we haven't
[04:39:33] actually played her this Abyss that's
[04:39:34] actually not a bad idea
[04:39:36] let me give Kazo 4V though
[04:40:00] thank you
[04:40:09] all right floor 12.
[04:40:13] do you agree I don't know with my
[04:40:15] statement
[04:40:16] so we're gonna play
[04:40:19] Aiko
[04:40:21] Shanghai
[04:40:24] kokomi
[04:40:32] Kaza
[04:40:34] second off
[04:40:37] we'll do your Mia
[04:40:41] sing Cho
[04:40:43] actually
[04:40:44] what elements do we need just pyro I
[04:40:47] mean I guess dendro's cool but we don't
[04:40:48] need it
[04:40:49] might just do shangling
[04:41:10] I mean like we just want like
[04:41:15] I guess think so
[04:41:29] I probably want a Healer right so we
[04:41:32] could do like
[04:41:33] you want a Healer we could do like
[04:41:36] a shield or we could do like we could do
[04:41:39] like any Shield but I kind of want an
[04:41:42] element I kind of want an element that
[04:41:43] would help break Shields I feel like
[04:41:44] baiju would help
[04:41:51] yeah I feel like budget would help
[04:42:02] okay but in this team we actually need
[04:42:04] DM on your email I agree and in this
[04:42:06] team we'd actually want some em because
[04:42:07] they're like none

[04:42:41] those are probably the wrong feathers
[04:42:43] probably got this one for crit rate
[04:42:44] because our our crit rate is too low and
[04:42:46] not builds
[04:42:52] berries
[04:42:53] we need some em so we'll do like
[04:42:56] we want to just go yam sounds I can't

[05:04:42] honestly
[05:04:48] I think for the very first time
[05:04:52] I don't want to do this
[05:04:56] he's playing Halo
[05:05:02] listen before the nilu mains arrive in
[05:05:04] my chat I
[05:05:05] this does explain quite a bit
[05:05:12] like I just I don't want to do this be
[05:05:15] nice to her I'm sorry it's a waste of
[05:05:16] time
[05:05:25] I agree
[05:05:32] oh yeah no way okay if he throws this I
[05:05:35] actually think it's impossible to throw
[05:05:36] this I know it wouldn't be clipped if he
[05:05:38] didn't throw it so I'm assuming he's
[05:05:39] gonna but literally how shangling
[05:05:42] powered it over vaporize it's dead it's
[05:05:45] like literally dead like you don't even
[05:05:48] need to think
[05:05:56] oh
[05:06:05] oh
[05:06:09] that is awkward that is actually awkward
[05:06:28] was that it okay
[05:06:37] wait but like
[05:06:41] wait why does this thing hide his energy
[05:06:44] kind of weird
[05:06:54] yeah I like you
[05:07:00] because it's cute
[05:07:04] bro there's a lot of cute things in this
[05:07:06] world I'm not hiding ice cream it's like
[05:07:08] cute
[05:07:09] lucky
[05:07:11] I mean I guess lesson to learn from [ __ ]
[05:07:14] like this is like right before you pop
[05:07:15] the shield you can proc a burst so you
[05:07:17] can like Syncro burst strangling burst
[05:07:19] before this even breaks right because
[05:07:21] like here like Google was killing it
[05:07:22] slowly
[05:07:24] and you can just like funnel that into
[05:07:26] strangling she'll get her pyrinado and
[05:07:28] then that would have been enough to kill
[05:07:29] but even if you want to sing show here
[05:07:30] you sing show
[05:07:32] which I think he did
[05:07:36] but it's kind of too late
[05:07:42] nerd how many nerd
[05:07:47] it's important
[05:07:49] Dodge
[05:07:55] is this
[05:07:57] no no no no no no no
[05:08:05] okay that was fun then preview
[05:08:17] I decided to listen to
[05:08:23] ragey
[05:08:27] you're a [ __ ] kidding me you [ __ ]
[05:08:33] [ __ ] Mike was [ __ ] clipping
[05:08:51] thank you Carrara I needed that I need
[05:08:54] the soothing meows after bad experience
[05:09:08] wait that's actually pretty cool
[05:09:13] you feel like Loki gets so much between
[05:09:15] coaching's first the inner second one
[05:09:18] nurse he's in
[05:09:19] Denver man okay dude
[05:09:23] I just choose to do Vermillion because
[05:09:25] it's efficient
[05:09:33] it's efficient okay for me right now
[05:09:36] it's efficient because I have like so
[05:09:38] many good pieces that I only need like
[05:09:39] one or two more and I'm done so like at
[05:09:42] this point it's like you may as well
[05:09:43] it'd be dumb not to honestly
[05:09:47] foreign
[05:09:48] but
[05:10:00] I don't think I should maybe tomorrow
[05:10:16] as I need time to sleep and [ __ ]
[05:10:19] I've been away for a while
[05:10:29] come on
[05:10:31] my brain feels like this song what does
[05:10:34] that
[05:10:34] means oh [ __ ] there's a tier three what
[05:10:37] the hell actually shark only fans
[05:10:43] I'm kidding but thanks to their every
[05:10:44] shape
[05:10:53] what time is it 3 47 am
[05:11:02] PS
[05:11:08] good artifact this run okay
[05:11:12] I believe in you
[05:11:18] we'll loot it in the cat box for good
[05:11:20] luck
[05:11:21] I'm actually something for four months
[05:11:24] balls
[05:11:30] all right well you lied
[05:11:34] maybe that echo's feather will only roll
[05:11:36] crit maybe who knows
[05:11:51] you seen the soup Castle meow deck no I
[05:11:53] have not
[05:11:55] why is that a thing
[05:11:57] I didn't throw oops
[05:12:06] I'll talk about it
[05:12:10] that is the gender if you don't have to
[05:12:12] have to talk about him missing John
[05:12:14] leapers we don't have to talk about that
[05:12:24] you know the meows the same in all
[05:12:26] languages I do we actually test that we
[05:12:27] Theory crafted the meows
[05:12:29] foreign
[05:12:36] level
[05:12:57] fallen leaves
[05:13:11] of Darkness wings of Darkness
[05:13:14] all right
[05:13:20] reaction to artifact in a nutshell one
[05:13:23] this could be good copium two e it could
[05:13:27] be decent three oh this is the one bro I
[05:13:30] don't sound like that
[05:13:32] I actually don't sound like that in this
[05:13:35] case I curate but
[05:13:37] I don't sound like that I actually
[05:13:38] thought it's not like that
[05:13:41] foreign
[05:13:57] but I need to I need to spend my resin I
[05:14:00] need my fix
[05:14:07] dude what if we did like
[05:14:10] what am I it's like something other than
[05:14:11] Vermillion
[05:14:13] maybe my lock is like elsewhere maybe I
[05:14:15] need to accept it
[05:14:19] now what am I saying
[05:14:21] I can't be true
[05:14:28] [Music]
[05:14:34] we almost woke up dude there's nothing
[05:14:36] to wake up from
[05:14:42] wow
[05:14:46] look here are so good you can literally
[05:14:48] distract chat instantly
[05:14:50] all I need to do is [ __ ] hold E 10
[05:14:53] second cooldown and I can distract you
[05:14:54] guys
[05:15:19] at this point only attacks on the
[05:15:22] Vermilion naked they'll make it stops
[05:15:24] Alex no because then I'll feel like I
[05:15:25] did so much before the tax that I might
[05:15:27] as well finish it because it was
[05:15:28] efficient right so it feels like oh I've
[05:15:30] done so much of the Like official one
[05:15:32] that I might as well just finish it
[05:15:34] before the tax gets out of hand
[05:15:36] inflation
[05:15:39] Max that there's a six months so
[05:15:45] um
[05:15:50] okay I already played both today but I
[05:15:52] could have light nowhere to hide

[05:16:33] take a look at my bank and realize
[05:16:35] there's nothing left cause I've been
[05:16:37] swiping and wishing so long that even my
[05:16:40] heart and thinks my account is trash but
[05:16:42] I never try changing should probably
[05:16:44] deserve it she was given for free
[05:16:56] I didn't prove someone right by saying
[05:16:59] this could be good that's a normal
[05:17:01] reaction to an artifact that could be
[05:17:03] good
[05:17:07] [Music]
[05:17:13] okay
[05:17:16] [Music]
[05:17:24] not using a shield yeah cause I have to
[05:17:26] use it to transport for the maximum
[05:17:28] meows I don't have it ready

[05:17:32] farming I can live a normal life I was
