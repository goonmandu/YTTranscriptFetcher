[00:14:27] they're probably dehydrated as [ __ ]
[00:14:30] anyways
[00:14:32] um a few things to talk about let's do
[00:14:33] one at a time let's start with the
[00:14:34] stereo things because it's a new Star
[00:14:36] Battle trailer let's do the start of
[00:14:37] things they'll do the Gentry things
[00:14:38] they'll keep going so star rail first of
[00:14:40] all
[00:14:41] we have a Kafka video oh I don't have it
[00:14:43] up in wait where's the new calculator
[00:14:46] um
[00:14:48] FRFR
[00:14:57] you look very handsome Mr socks did The
[00:15:00] Duality of my Donuts people from talking
[00:15:02] about your small stature I'm not I'm not
[00:15:06] small I'm wide and tall anyways Mom that
[00:15:11] was the word because it's like longitude
[00:15:13] latitude okay listen so start all things
[00:15:15] two things first of all we're gonna talk
[00:15:17] about are we gonna watch this video but
[00:15:18] first I need to talk about the captain
[00:15:20] video I made a guide a banger go watch
[00:15:22] it
[00:15:24] [Music]
[00:15:29] it's not that much worse than D.O.T
[00:15:31] Kafka they're dot Kafka okay listen
[00:15:37] I give credit where credit is due and if
[00:15:39] I'm wrong I'll be like yo I'm wrong I
[00:15:41] sure don't like the only thing I'm gonna
[00:15:42] say for Kafka is it isn't significantly
[00:15:46] worse than dot but it is worse and
[00:15:50] by quite a it's significantly worse if
[00:15:52] you factor in the teams you need and the
[00:15:54] ease of sub stats and the ease of access
[00:15:56] so
[00:16:00] in hindsight should have maybe said like
[00:16:02] yo like because I mentioned it as being
[00:16:03] like good substance but you shouldn't do
[00:16:05] it should I imagine even like hey if you
[00:16:07] want to do it do it yeah so I should
[00:16:08] have done that my bad but I do have to
[00:16:11] say
[00:16:12] dot is better in basically every way
[00:16:14] also people who are commenting like what
[00:16:16] if you have a spare bronya you don't
[00:16:18] have a spare Bond yeah you don't you
[00:16:19] literally don't your other team 99 of
[00:16:22] the time wants brania or Ting Yoon or
[00:16:24] whoever the [ __ ] so it's like and if
[00:16:26] like what is your other team sample like
[00:16:28] no you're the the characters that nobody
[00:16:29] uses you can now use with Kafka give her
[00:16:32] a super unique and like
[00:16:34] very strong but also like very unique
[00:16:36] playstyle whereas every other DPS
[00:16:38] character is the [ __ ] same pretty
[00:16:40] much okay crit lightning that or like
[00:16:42] whatever Elemental goblet attack and
[00:16:44] then you just Spam crit and you do the
[00:16:46] same [ __ ] branya Ting Yoon like silver
[00:16:48] wolf Pila like any of those mix and
[00:16:50] match you play the same [ __ ] every
[00:16:51] [ __ ] DPS Kafka gives you a unique
[00:16:53] playstyle that's better than that crit
[00:16:55] build by like not about like the hugest
[00:16:57] margin because other builds still fine
[00:16:58] but it's better and use supports that
[00:17:01] aren't high value or like Niche and is a
[00:17:04] lot like makes her in in my opinion a
[00:17:06] unique distinguished woman instead of
[00:17:09] just the generic [ __ ] NPC that a crit
[00:17:11] build would make her that is my take so
[00:17:15] I put up and calling me like yeah you
[00:17:16] can play crit if you want I kind of like
[00:17:18] emphasize what I just told you guys yeah
[00:17:20] you can play Chris
[00:17:21] that's the only thing I wish I would add
[00:17:23] take my saved everything else I still
[00:17:26] think like everything else is correct
[00:17:27] and is yeah
[00:17:29] um
[00:17:31] yeah like I think if you're like the
[00:17:33] only problem is like in a game like this
[00:17:35] you're gonna pull for who you like and
[00:17:36] if you just like Kafka and you're like I
[00:17:38] [ __ ] hate sampo I [ __ ] hate Luca I
[00:17:40] [ __ ] hate serval I [ __ ] hate like
[00:17:41] chemical whatever then sure player crit
[00:17:44] with brania and like that's the one
[00:17:46] thing I should have said
[00:17:48] so I pinned a comment but I don't think
[00:17:51] that's
[00:17:52] how you should play Kafka it's also not
[00:17:54] the best way to play Kafka but I'm also
[00:17:55] not here to be like you have to play her
[00:17:57] this way that's just the best way which
[00:17:58] is what I try to give that's all
[00:18:02] I love Kafka
[00:18:04] um very accessible very strong character
[00:18:05] so go watch if you want
[00:18:07] um
[00:18:09] even using a sold out dog bill is a way
[00:18:11] better what [ __ ] are people Cal King
[00:18:12] yeah like dot is better but it's like
[00:18:14] yeah it's on Twitch
[00:18:16] people like oh
[00:18:19] well I should like it's like yeah like
[00:18:20] you can use it like if you want this but
[00:18:21] like whatever it's all good also dude
[00:18:24] you can
[00:18:26] why were people dude I saw someone
[00:18:28] slandering blade on my TL being like Oh
[00:18:30] Captain's so much better than
[00:18:31] first of all first of all [ __ ] you
[00:18:33] second of all second of all says who
[00:18:36] third of all why do you need to lift up
[00:18:39] one and and burrow down another Blaze
[00:18:42] broken
[00:18:44] both are great
[00:18:46] blade is goated kafka's golden
[00:18:50] blade is so gay you guys don't
[00:18:52] understand sorry to keep talking about
[00:18:53] style because it's a country stream
[00:18:54] although I do want to play sorrow but I
[00:18:56] don't know anyways
[00:18:58] every time I Auto Battle
[00:19:00] I do blade bronial and then someone and
[00:19:03] then half the time that last person's
[00:19:05] dead and like one time my brownie died
[00:19:07] and I can still Auto Battle with only
[00:19:09] blade and the ultra and I still like I
[00:19:11] never it literally never loses I know
[00:19:13] Autobell no one cares but like literally
[00:19:15] blade is just Blade the wheelchair you
[00:19:17] just turn your brain off and you can
[00:19:18] just do anything
[00:19:19] anyways
[00:19:21] I mean we also brain off the Moc so it's
[00:19:23] not like it was just the easy content
[00:19:24] but
[00:19:25] anyways back to um oh no no we have to
[00:19:28] watch this now
[00:19:29] where is it
[00:19:31] yes new trailer
[00:19:36] did you talk about Catherine compared to
[00:19:38] Jin Yuan uh no but there's no reason to
[00:19:40] do that
[00:19:42] because okay they're completely
[00:19:43] different play Styles in every way like
[00:19:45] you don't play them at all the same
[00:19:46] however I do agree if you're like oh AOE
[00:19:48] lighting DPS cap is better
[00:19:50] so fair
[00:19:52] um I mean she is better but tingling's
[00:19:54] you know
[00:19:59] also dude in my recommended
[00:20:04] on YouTube I saw something called French
[00:20:06] core what the [ __ ] is French core
[00:20:08] try look it up
[00:20:15] but also like here's why I don't think
[00:20:17] comparison matters who cares like
[00:20:19] they're both good like obviously like
[00:20:21] one is better than the other sure but
[00:20:23] like just play the one you like like I
[00:20:25] think meta like matters in terms of like
[00:20:27] if you want to clear with low investment
[00:20:29] but also it's like to the [ __ ] like why
[00:20:31] are you guys going to war like it
[00:20:32] doesn't matter
[00:20:36] because it's not like I'm like oh I
[00:20:38] don't care about meta because that's not
[00:20:39] true it's like with Genji especially
[00:20:41] it's like I will tell you guys what's
[00:20:42] good so that if you want to clear
[00:20:44] without wasting your life like like you
[00:20:46] know it can be useful to know that yeah
[00:20:47] elon's a good [ __ ] pull you might
[00:20:49] want yilon for your who Tower like with
[00:20:50] Synchro like you can do sing show your
[00:20:51] lawn like there's a reason to know these
[00:20:54] things but it's also like if you're
[00:20:55] going at like fighting being like Jing
[00:20:57] yuan is terrible then I was like dude
[00:20:58] like what are you doing I I feel like I
[00:21:01] notice a lot of like the early stages of
[00:21:04] this game being recreated in like Star
[00:21:07] rail 2 which I don't like it's like the
[00:21:09] mistakes that people here made are like
[00:21:10] remaking there and there's like the
[00:21:12] clickbait videos like Theory Crafters
[00:21:14] are toxic and then it's like it's like
[00:21:15] dude like this [ __ ] happened with
[00:21:18] gentian and now everyone's cool it's
[00:21:19] like why are you guys like what is
[00:21:21] happening anyways it's all good
[00:21:32] comparing is only in my opinion relevant
[00:21:34] when it's like a direct like if
[00:21:37] someone's like yozox like should I use
[00:21:38] on the answer is usually both because
[00:21:40] they're both [ __ ] good but like that
[00:21:42] makes sense or if you're like but if
[00:21:43] someone asks me like who's like who's
[00:21:46] better who Tau well uh without okay well
[00:21:49] I mean that's in that case you just say
[00:21:51] play shangling but like if you ask me
[00:21:53] like
[00:21:54] I don't know
[00:21:56] it's just like kazua or like a main DPS
[00:21:58] like I don't know [ __ ] like shangling
[00:22:00] or or yolan it's like you know you might
[00:22:03] want to have a support on your account
[00:22:04] more I guess China's not a five star why
[00:22:06] can't they think of a good example right
[00:22:07] now I'm stupid let's move on but like
[00:22:11] I don't know
[00:22:18] like hutau Mia is a comparison that's
[00:22:21] gonna happen but a comparison like hutau
[00:22:24] or kazua like what are you talking about
[00:22:25] like if you're on a main DPS like
[00:22:27] obviously causes a way better pull but
[00:22:28] if you want to make DPS you're gonna
[00:22:30] like [ __ ] hotao anyways we're gonna
[00:22:32] watch the trailer I'm gonna stop
[00:22:34] branding uh let me change my webcam so I
[00:22:36] can full screen this without [ __ ] it
[00:22:37] up
[00:22:44] I could not think of a good example for
[00:22:46] the life of me so I don't know what
[00:22:48] words were coming out of my mouth

[00:29:38] scoffed uh it was from my last two
[00:29:40] videos but we put an audio filter on it
[00:29:42] shout out to Alan for that so it should
[00:29:44] be fine but for the stream if I talk
[00:29:46] close apparently it's scuffed so just
[00:29:49] know that
[00:29:50] because my go XLR is my audio software
[00:29:53] it's still under warranty but the USB
[00:29:55] port is like [ __ ] and I made it worse
[00:29:56] by trying to fix it because I'm stupid
[00:29:57] so I'm they're gonna like fix it but
[00:30:00] they're donut Walling me so ordered a
[00:30:01] new one and then I'm gonna like return
[00:30:03] don't worry I got it because someone
[00:30:05] made fun of me I wasn't gonna get a new
[00:30:06] one and just go with a warranty but this
[00:30:07] one shot was like oh you can spend

[00:30:40] my res once again
[00:30:42] can you guys rate my wrist just once
[00:30:43] again
[00:30:46] so Fang tweeted whoever designed this I
[00:30:49] hope you get a raise true oh we have to
[00:30:51] talk about these [ __ ] enemies by the
[00:30:52] way these are [ __ ] adorable I hope we
[00:30:54] don't have to fight it but here it said
[00:30:57] um they just tweeted about it I read
[00:30:59] this off stream sorry chat because it
[00:31:00] was literally right before I streamed
[00:31:01] but actually yeah they said first of all
[00:31:04] these enemies are [ __ ] adorable
[00:31:06] but what they say is despite their cute
[00:31:08] and friendly appearance some quarter
[00:31:09] creatures can be rather aggressive which
[00:31:10] means we're gonna have to fight the seal
[00:31:12] which is [ __ ] annoying because look
[00:31:13] at how cute he is I don't want to kill
[00:31:15] it I want to put in my teapot so
[00:31:17] hopefully we can get another teapot but
[00:31:19] yeah so sag uh maybe who knows maybe not
[00:31:22] and then the Otters are friendly though
[00:31:24] if you guys didn't see there's a
[00:31:25] friendly otter a harmless aquatic
[00:31:27] creature so apparently you're gonna have
[00:31:28] to help it out so it's like a silly
[00:31:30] maybe I don't know but this is adorable
[00:31:31] so very cute
[00:31:34] um
[00:31:41] anyways
[00:31:43] um
[00:31:44] yeah so there's this seal thing right
[00:31:47] then I replied Fang dude about it I
[00:31:50] applied seals are my favorite animal by
[00:31:51] the way they really steal my heart haha
[00:31:54] LOL what's yours now first of all W is

[00:31:59] seal get it you guys probably don't get
[00:32:00] it but I get it because I'm smart it's
[00:32:02] like a sealed so it made sense then she
[00:32:04] said what and like normally most people
[00:32:06] would be like oh it's a stalemate here
[00:32:08] she obviously doesn't want to talk to me
[00:32:09] all right I'm closing my phone but
[00:32:11] since I am the rizzler I replied
[00:32:16] what is love baby don't hurt me true

[00:36:21] team maybe get Lynette too surely
[00:36:24] they'll be good together right surely
[00:36:25] they probably won't but it is

[00:36:36] why someone can link it I don't really
[00:36:37] know how to look the oh wait I know how
[00:36:39] to look that up never mind gunshin JP
[00:36:41] Twitter
[00:36:45] why
[00:36:47] are you guys baiting me
[00:36:54] you guys are baiting me there's only
[00:36:55] nothing new
[00:37:02] wow that is I mean not bad
[00:37:04] um I like the fact that he's a magician
[00:37:06] I heard about the well I didn't really
[00:37:08] hear about it but I heard about it I
[00:37:09] like I like summary heard about the
[00:37:11] Korea uh Lenny trailer incident
[00:37:15] which from my understanding is very
[00:37:17] weird champ it seems like just
[00:37:20] I don't know I mean I could be wrong but
[00:37:21] from my understanding of it it's just
[00:37:23] people being like Oh not a waifu I'm mad
[00:37:26] which is weird they deleted it
[00:37:33] okay breaking my silence don't K-pop
[00:37:34] Idols also get harassed all the time for
[00:37:36] no reason what's happening like can fans
[00:37:39] chill what are you guys doing calm the
[00:37:41] [ __ ] down
[00:37:43] grow a [ __ ] pair what are you doing
[00:37:44] grow up
[00:37:46] [ __ ] up what's happening anyways I
[00:37:49] don't know I don't actually know like I
[00:37:50] haven't clicked on the trailer myself so
[00:37:52] I'm just going from word of mouth but
[00:37:54] anyways
[00:37:58] no no I'm on the Japanese server but I
[00:38:00] don't see anything like oh we already
[00:38:02] saw this
[00:38:03] so I don't know why people saying check
[00:38:04] it
[00:38:14] deleted it oh
[00:38:21] I see such
[00:38:24] keep in mind when I say there's like
[00:38:25] some toxic people like ah because I see
[00:38:28] people in chat generalizing like it's
[00:38:29] always just some people like don't like
[00:38:30] don't be weird but yeah I don't know
[00:38:32] that's just weird I don't I never get
[00:38:33] that like I get like I know a lot of
[00:38:35] gotcha games are like
[00:38:37] just like waifu like simulator but like
[00:38:40] I feel like Genji in particular has
[00:38:42] never just been that when you factor in
[00:38:44] that in 1.0 the best characters were
[00:38:46] Bennett cincho venti and then Shang Ling
[00:38:48] but we didn't really know Shango was
[00:38:49] broken back then well people thought
[00:38:51] Crescent Pike changling was broken but
[00:38:52] anyways like Shang Ling who's not you
[00:38:55] know and then like
[00:38:56] yeah so you're like technically official
[00:38:58] the official also got better like so
[00:39:00] like literally like dungeon's never been
[00:39:02] like
[00:39:03] that
[00:39:07] but um there was definitely some people
[00:39:09] who
[00:39:10] were I remember I remember when God you
[00:39:13] came out
[00:39:14] actually no gunny was even bad remember
[00:39:16] when Eula came out actually I don't want
[00:39:17] to go down that rabbit hole dude when
[00:39:19] you let dude and Matt dude criticizing
[00:39:21] Eula when people oh my god dude
[00:39:24] criticizing Eula when people had shrines
[00:39:27] of her and literally were like oh this
[00:39:30] YouTuber hit 2 million damage so you're
[00:39:32] wrong I'm like oh you know anyways all
[00:39:35] good uh Lenny POG uh there's gonna be a
[00:39:38] Lindy guide Lynnette guide Hydra MC and
[00:39:40] facial those are my that's my plan so
[00:39:41] I'm hyperfonte I am I'm gonna be honest
[00:39:44] I like the I think his gameplay is gonna
[00:39:46] be very unique because he turns into a
[00:39:47] cat box which is cool
[00:39:49] um however do you know who else has
[00:39:50] unique gameplay do I play no but I do
[00:39:54] think it looks cool so we'll see if he's
[00:39:55] cool or not uh I'll let you guys know
[00:39:57] I'll be honest I will say though
[00:40:02] oh yeah for a minute from a days later
[00:40:04] though from his second half I am very
[00:40:06] hyped for the other uh characters as
[00:40:08] well so be careful with your Primo jumps
[00:40:09] like naviette uh the cryo guy Risley
[00:40:14] the [ __ ] the the the the the the the
[00:40:16] the the the the archon whatever name is
[00:40:20] uh [ __ ] what's it what's her name the
[00:40:22] girl whose button won't hold her like
[00:40:25] okay I I don't know her name the electro
[00:40:27] pirate
[00:40:29] whatever those characters we're High
[00:40:32] we're hype we're excited we can't wait
[00:40:34] so that is uh who uh we need a lot of uh
[00:40:37] Primo gems we need a lot of Primo gems
[00:40:40] that's all I'm gonna say okay no more
[00:40:41] stalling actually a bit more stalling I
[00:40:43] uploaded a second Channel video I called
[00:40:44] it warning skill issue detected
[00:40:48] and it's [ __ ] funny so go watch it no
[00:40:50] spoilers but let's just say my
[00:40:52] exploration features uh uh content like
[00:40:54] this
[00:40:57] oh see I'm actually cracked okay I'm
[00:40:59] actually cracked though some of the
[00:41:00] exploration I admit was kind of bad but
[00:41:02] dude someone's on crap okay no spoilers
[00:41:04] but spoilers look at this look at this
[00:41:05] look at this shot dude no one in this
[00:41:08] chat could hit the shot look look look
[00:41:09] look look literally look literally look
[00:41:14] how does he do it
[00:41:17] anyways
[00:41:18] I thought this was a fan account as a
[00:41:20] second account Mariah at its um most of
[00:41:23] it
[00:41:24] who was a click timer I used to be a
[00:41:26] clip Channel and then I yanked him I was
[00:41:28] like dude you're cracked same shirt how
[00:41:30] is this to say the shirt there is black
[00:41:33] oh that's the thumbnail the shirt
[00:41:34] there's white I'm wearing beige what are
[00:41:36] you talking about
[00:41:39] anyways
[00:41:41] um so this is yeah I released a new
[00:41:43] video on the new artifacts and a Kafka
[00:41:45] guide I told you guys about it uh so I
[00:41:47] think we're good I think we're good is
[00:41:49] there any other tab I want to talk about
[00:41:50] oh this new weapons okay well look at
[00:41:52] that anything else
[00:41:56] okay
[00:41:57] all right new weapons
[00:41:59] now I think I'm gonna make a detailed uh
[00:42:01] video on these but I think I know some
[00:42:04] people might rush one but I think mine
[00:42:05] has to be delayed a little because I
[00:42:06] want to do Lenny Lynette and Hydra MC so
[00:42:09] it's kind of hard to do it right now and
[00:42:10] my audio setup scuffed until tomorrow
[00:42:12] but
[00:42:13] okay and thinks a thousand bits
[00:42:15] I I can't I'm not opening Discord right
[00:42:17] now but I'm gonna need my alerts
[00:42:20] um I will say
[00:42:22] some of these weapons need some math to
[00:42:24] be done
[00:42:25] um but from my understanding a lot of
[00:42:28] them look pretty good so first of all oh
[00:42:30] yeah first of all we're not getting an
[00:42:31] HP sword uh which is I I like really I
[00:42:35] almost knew I thought I knew they were
[00:42:37] gonna get an HP sword prototype for
[00:42:40] Fontan we're not so that sucks but
[00:42:42] Winnie's bow
[00:42:44] um is pretty insane for Linney
[00:42:47] um
[00:42:48] we think how would I know I don't know
[00:42:50] I'm saying it is a pretty insane bow
[00:42:51] that if Lenny's kit works though like if
[00:42:54] you can use all the stats it's insane
[00:42:56] that's what I mean there's no leaks here
[00:42:58] I'm just saying if you can use all of
[00:43:00] these stats it's really good that is
[00:43:02] what I'm saying that is what I'm saying
[00:43:03] so the first great magic bow first of
[00:43:07] all this looks [ __ ] sick there's a
[00:43:08] staff with a bow but don't be don't be
[00:43:11] baited by the looks because it is for
[00:43:13] charge attackers but it's also just good
[00:43:15] because it has a lot of crit damage and
[00:43:16] base stack so we're gonna read it first
[00:43:17] of all bow of Homa
[00:43:21] uh let me play background music though
[00:43:29] damage dealt by charge tax increased by
[00:43:31] 16 so good stats plus 60 charge stock so
[00:43:34] far so good then every party member with
[00:43:36] the same Elemental type oh mono pyro
[00:43:38] monohydro mono electricity
[00:43:41] you gain one sack
[00:43:45] and then uh when you have one tooth or
[00:43:47] three stacks you have attack and then
[00:43:49] you have movement speed Moon speeds cool
[00:43:50] but it's kind of whatever but it's kind
[00:43:52] of cool uh maybe it matters for like
[00:43:54] Lenny's like cat form but anyways I
[00:43:56] don't actually know
[00:43:58] um and then the attack is nice so like
[00:43:59] if you can make use of this attack even
[00:44:01] if it's like just 32 instead of 48 like
[00:44:02] 32 and then six percent chargeback
[00:44:04] damage and then also six six uh crit
[00:44:07] damage like basically a Homa that's
[00:44:09] pretty good pretty [ __ ] go uh good
[00:44:11] yeah like freeze gonya has two crowd
[00:44:13] characters
[00:44:15] um
[00:44:16] uh even big Tonka tanari so yeah
[00:44:24] it's movement speed is [ __ ] useless I
[00:44:26] mean yeah but it's cool but it's a nice
[00:44:28] looking bow good stats
[00:44:30] um but obviously they'll be exact weapon
[00:44:31] rankings for like each character when I
[00:44:33] make a video on it so yeah uh we have a
[00:44:35] new [ __ ] fishing weapon now I'm gonna
[00:44:37] be real this [ __ ] is called this [ __ ]
[00:44:39] looks goofy I want it so I might have to
[00:44:41] fish again it's called flip sound
[00:44:44] ferryman
[00:44:46] um which is basically the catch but
[00:44:48] reversed it's skill damage
[00:44:52] it's so it gives you energy recharge
[00:44:54] like the catch and then increases skill
[00:44:56] crit rate and your energy recharge after
[00:44:59] use your skill I assume that R5 is gonna
[00:45:01] be doubled
[00:45:02] uh we know catch is 12 right so it's
[00:45:05] probably 12 as well
[00:45:06] I assume it's the same as catch but
[00:45:08] let's just assume it's the same as catch
[00:45:10] um
[00:45:11] so yeah it looks good but for who is
[00:45:14] like the question mark it's uh it's a
[00:45:16] sword it's probably future characters
[00:45:18] like for now you can be like oh like you
[00:45:20] know I'll hide them like skill but it's
[00:45:22] like do you need that much ER and I'll
[00:45:24] hide them probably not
[00:45:26] um and then a lot of like yeah it's like
[00:45:29] you know yeah you sound like sing show
[00:45:31] or something but
[00:45:32] it really looks like future characters
[00:45:36] doesn't need 45 plus 16 maybe like 24 I
[00:45:40] think percent energy recharge Albedo
[00:45:42] presses Ian then swaps so it's like
[00:45:46] uh and Hardware Don gives you oh yeah oh
[00:45:49] my God oh my yo Harvard or Don is so
[00:45:51] much Harbinger Don literally shits on
[00:45:53] this robino
[00:45:55] um but yeah
[00:45:57] anyways
[00:45:59] it looks really cool so I want it and I
[00:46:01] assume there's no way they design a
[00:46:03] weapon for Fontan and then don't make a
[00:46:06] character that can use it so yeah maybe
[00:46:07] Lynette I don't know what the [ __ ] she
[00:46:08] does maybe like maybe another [ __ ]
[00:46:10] sword character that's coming out
[00:46:11] probably so keep that in mind because I
[00:46:13] also noticed that's okay I also noticed
[00:46:15] that scrolling down there's a lot of
[00:46:17] weapons that buff your skill or when you
[00:46:19] use a skill or some [ __ ] like um
[00:46:22] maybe I'm lying and I just remembered
[00:46:24] incorrectly but I could have sworn yeah
[00:46:26] when using an elemental skill
[00:46:29] um okay yeah when using a skill like it
[00:46:31] obviously gives you attack which means
[00:46:33] it doesn't have to be for a skill
[00:46:34] character but if you're gonna make so
[00:46:36] many so much [ __ ] around your Elemental
[00:46:38] skill there's probably many characters I
[00:46:39] can use it probably to check Korean
[00:46:41] Genji in Twitter
[00:46:44] uh manka
[00:46:49] manka
[00:46:51] I don't know if I want to do that
[00:46:54] mocha w
[00:46:56] ow after the Lenny incident
[00:47:02] anyways um okay
[00:47:04] there's new BattleBots weapons [ __ ]
[00:47:06] finally and the new free to play weapons
[00:47:08] as I said I think I'll make either one
[00:47:09] video encompassing both or one comparing
[00:47:11] battle pass weapons and the other uh for
[00:47:13] the free play ones but with that in mind
[00:47:16] side of the Blazing Sun
[00:47:18] wait should I go through all of them
[00:47:19] today
[00:47:23] sure well I mean okay
[00:47:26] make one vid per weapon
[00:47:30] what do you think I should pull the
[00:47:31] Yolanda kokomi
[00:47:33] um I am the biggest fan of kokomi nation
[00:47:35] but yolan's also broken so the correct
[00:47:38] answer is one of two things either both
[00:47:39] or pick the one that is most needed in
[00:47:42] your teams for example you're playing
[00:47:43] like freeze you don't have Mona you want
[00:47:45] to get off field Hydro Maybe hyperbloom
[00:47:46] kokomi on the other side you're playing
[00:47:49] like a vape team or you want some like
[00:47:51] with your Sanctuary
[00:47:52] yolan it depends on the team you're
[00:47:54] playing they're both good
[00:48:04] uh
[00:48:05] opponents of our uh we'll send dealing
[00:48:07] attack and then you also get uh the
[00:48:10] opponents take more charge attack damage
[00:48:12] from the wielder so you get crit rate
[00:48:13] high base attack
[00:48:15] and more charge knock damage so
[00:48:16] basically kind of like a verdescent hunt
[00:48:18] but less crit rate
[00:48:21] and then the effect will give you
[00:48:22] chargeback damage basically so if you're
[00:48:24] a charge tracker
[00:48:26] you can use this but this is a battle
[00:48:28] pass weapon
[00:48:30] soccer visual aid gives you uh this one
[00:48:33] is weird I remember reading this so this
[00:48:35] one gives you a [ __ ] ton of crit rate
[00:48:37] but the base stack is really low so
[00:48:39] that's really good if you're like an HP
[00:48:41] scaling character or like anything else
[00:48:43] I mean it's still fine for attack
[00:48:44] because you can bet it buff whatever but
[00:48:46] a lot of great but then the effect is
[00:48:48] weird as [ __ ] I thought they reposted it
[00:48:50] all good
[00:48:53] um the the effect is really weird it's
[00:48:56] when not on the field Max HP will be
[00:48:59] increased and EM will be increased and
[00:49:00] then when you're on the field for 10
[00:49:01] seconds it's canceled now being on the
[00:49:04] field for 10 seconds is a lot even like
[00:49:06] some DPS characters aren't even on for
[00:49:08] that long like if you're just like you
[00:49:09] can swap so
[00:49:13] crit Comey yeah actually it's like weird
[00:49:16] like this crit is a lot to where even if
[00:49:18] it's not supposed to be good it's
[00:49:19] probably fine if you have like attack
[00:49:21] Buffs or a non-attack scaling character
[00:49:24] but outside of that is kind of weird uh
[00:49:25] I do think yay
[00:49:27] I'd have to see the characters to solar
[00:49:29] Pearl but
[00:49:31] yeah if you go em Sans
[00:49:34] and then you have em Buffs this is
[00:49:37] probably 80 at R5 oh it's a battlefield
[00:49:39] it's probably fine but uh like wait what
[00:49:42] this let me look up solar Pearl it's 20
[00:49:45] right what's the percentage on Silver
[00:49:47] Pearl
[00:49:48] 27 crit rate and then yeah 20. yeah like
[00:49:54] yeah no no I actually forgot how much
[00:49:56] this is no I would like yeah no solar
[00:49:59] Pearl is
[00:50:00] yeah so I think this is for a future
[00:50:02] character because it's HP em all field
[00:50:04] probably a future character
[00:50:09] uh I'll probably make a video on these
[00:50:10] though but yeah Ballad of the fjords is
[00:50:13] a polar arm that was created an em so
[00:50:16] another changeling buff oppa
[00:50:22] tell me why shangling is so op I mean
[00:50:27] you probably still use the catch but
[00:50:28] another option dude changley has so many
[00:50:31] options but it's also good for hutao
[00:50:33] um because Death Match is like pretty
[00:50:35] decent on her but the effect will give
[00:50:37] you attack whereas this one's a fact
[00:50:40] gives you em
[00:50:42] which is really good for hotel really
[00:50:44] [ __ ] good
[00:50:46] is this gotcha it is Battle pass so
[00:50:48] yesen
[00:50:50] these are battle pass Talking Stick
[00:50:52] [ __ ] amazing name
[00:50:55] um I remember okay first of all I have
[00:50:57] to say
[00:50:58] there are very few weapons in all of
[00:51:00] genjin that I think are better than
[00:51:02] serpents Vine like yeah you like five
[00:51:03] star weapons but even some five stars
[00:51:05] aren't as good as if it's fine servants
[00:51:06] mine is [ __ ] stupid it's so good
[00:51:09] but with that in mind Talking Stick
[00:51:12] um tackle the increase by 16 for 15
[00:51:14] seconds after being affected by Pyro
[00:51:19] okay Bennett what the [ __ ] I mean
[00:51:21] Bennett affects you my pyro instantly it
[00:51:22] doesn't matter but okay
[00:51:25] um well it does matter but like Bennett
[00:51:26] pyro affects you if he just uses burst
[00:51:29] foreign
[00:51:44] I mean
[00:51:51] I get like okay you can't really use
[00:51:54] serpent spine in like version because
[00:51:56] you like with Daya you take a [ __ ] ton
[00:51:58] of damage you lose your serpent spine
[00:51:59] Stacks right so
[00:52:02] maybe Talking Stick you get me
[00:52:05] because you can't stop yeah they are
[00:52:07] getting a buff but it's a battle pass
[00:52:09] now I know this is cope but I will say
[00:52:12] serpent spine is so broken that it
[00:52:14] doesn't matter if the next Claymore
[00:52:16] isn't as good because just pick serpent
[00:52:18] spine I know that's like a cringe take
[00:52:19] but you know it's a battle pass you're
[00:52:21] paying for it you don't want to pay and
[00:52:22] get a bad weapon right so
[00:52:24] yeah I mean in there am I missing
[00:52:27] something maybe oh oh my God oh my God
[00:52:31] invert remember when the battle pass
[00:52:33] first came out no you don't you were
[00:52:34] like 12. but listen people were like no
[00:52:36] it's bad because what if you're playing
[00:52:38] the Luke and you there's burning grass
[00:52:40] and then you lose your stats
[00:52:43] with the Talking Stick that helps you in
[00:52:46] version 4.5 the abyss will be all grass
[00:52:49] and Talking Stick will be meta because
[00:52:51] you're gonna be burning grass true true
[00:52:53] all right so yeah that's the meta
[00:52:56] uh next up we have wolf Fang
[00:53:00] is Fang in the chat thing
[00:53:03] this is a pretty Weapon by the way I
[00:53:04] actually like this it's a sword kind of
[00:53:06] looks like a claymore but
[00:53:09] I like it
[00:53:14] what's my taskbar my second screen
[00:53:15] [ __ ] anyways
[00:53:18] anyways uh gives you a nice amount of
[00:53:21] criterate some base attack uh now just
[00:53:23] looking from it I'm pretty sure I read
[00:53:24] this already it looks like a like black
[00:53:26] sword is like for normal attackers right
[00:53:28] so this is like
[00:53:30] or normal in charge why do I not
[00:53:31] remember the [ __ ] box am I a terrible
[00:53:33] Gadget player I'm washed I'm actually
[00:53:35] washed I know it's normal in charge
[00:53:36] right let me look it up yeah it is it is
[00:53:38] it is first yeah no no charge okay yeah
[00:53:41] this is skill and burst so damage dealt
[00:53:43] by skill and burst increase by 16. one
[00:53:45] of the skill at the moment it's gains
[00:53:47] criterate your skill gets criterate and
[00:53:48] then when your burst also gets great
[00:53:49] right and then these are two percent at
[00:53:51] R1 but Stacks four times what's two
[00:53:53] times four chat you know this
[00:53:55] come on guys two plus two plus two plus
[00:53:57] two come on chat
[00:53:59] exactly eight
[00:54:05] anyways um yeah so it's it's pretty like
[00:54:08] I like the sword a lot
[00:54:11] um because black sword is like good but
[00:54:13] a lot of characters that use swords like
[00:54:16] a lot of them are just you know use
[00:54:17] their burst let me weave you or like
[00:54:20] skill or like I'll hide the normal
[00:54:21] attacks but his skill is like a big
[00:54:24] chunk of his damage because his mirrors
[00:54:25] and like so wolfang really [ __ ] good
[00:54:28] uh obviously we'd have to calc like
[00:54:30] comparing it to Black sword for like
[00:54:31] every character I'll probably do that uh
[00:54:34] but it doesn't matter basically if you
[00:54:35] want to use your skill reverse just slap
[00:54:37] this instead of black sword and it'll be
[00:54:38] better like a lot better uh if that's
[00:54:41] what you care about
[00:54:43] I think this is really good
[00:54:45] uh because you got a lot of crit rate
[00:54:46] the bass hacks is like whatever it's not
[00:54:48] terrible
[00:54:50] um because like this one's four five
[00:54:51] four
[00:54:52] and then the effect I guess the effect
[00:54:55] I wonder how it refines probably it's
[00:54:58] double when it's one stop when it's
[00:55:00] three it's like
[00:55:01] yeah anyways really it looks really good
[00:55:04] it's also less ugly than black sword yo
[00:55:07] what did Black sword do to you
[00:55:12] okay guys surely the black so those are
[00:55:14] bypass now there's also blacksmith
[00:55:15] weapons but surely the blacks with
[00:55:16] weapon uh the blacksmith sword is gonna
[00:55:18] be an HP sword don't worry guys if the
[00:55:21] battle pass one's not HP you'll get a HP
[00:55:23] sword on the as the free to play uh the
[00:55:26] free-to-play option from the blacksmith
[00:55:28] let's see let's see let's see oh it's
[00:55:30] attack percent
[00:55:33] it looks sick I honestly think this
[00:55:35] looks [ __ ] like this looks low-key
[00:55:37] cooler than the battle pass one uh but
[00:55:39] yeah it's attack
[00:55:45] okay now I'm gonna say it I don't know
[00:55:47] what's with Fontan and having like a HP
[00:55:49] healing fetish but literally every sword
[00:55:51] is like if you got healed [ __ ] gained
[00:55:54] the [ __ ] friend I don't know I don't
[00:55:56] know I don't know but literally all
[00:55:58] these stories do that and like it seems
[00:56:00] like there might be like future
[00:56:01] mechanics Future character whatever the
[00:56:02] [ __ ] it's probably like susk but a lot
[00:56:06] of it is like
[00:56:07] not bad it's just like it looks weird
[00:56:10] when you read it and you're like okay
[00:56:11] what is happening so yeah uh first thing
[00:56:14] I notice is that this needs the hand
[00:56:16] guards
[00:56:19] I hate Hangouts
[00:56:22] anyways finale of The Deep gives you
[00:56:23] attack a very high base attack that's a
[00:56:25] 44 base at level one same as prototype
[00:56:27] broncore for reference before uh dendro
[00:56:30] came out even some kitchens that weren't
[00:56:33] elect that were like Electro or
[00:56:34] something not physical would use wrong
[00:56:36] core because the base attack was high
[00:56:37] even if the physical damage was wasted
[00:56:39] it's not her best option obviously but
[00:56:40] as a freedom option it was fine so
[00:56:42] seeing a high base stack weapon with
[00:56:43] also some attack percent
[00:56:45] makes it already decent obviously now
[00:56:46] use iron sting but that's already like
[00:56:49] that's already something
[00:56:51] when using an elemental skill
[00:56:55] attack will be increased by 12 I assume
[00:56:57] you refined this
[00:56:59] um for free
[00:57:05] like 18 no it's so it's 24 if it's
[00:57:08] doubled and a lot of weapons just double
[00:57:10] at R5 but I don't know if this one will
[00:57:13] anyways
[00:57:15] 12 to 24. uh when you use your skill you
[00:57:18] can attack and a bald life will be where
[00:57:19] 25 people will be granted
[00:57:22] yeah
[00:57:24] this effect can be triggered once every
[00:57:26] 10 seconds when Bond of life is clear to
[00:57:28] maximum 150.
[00:57:30] yeah this spot attacks come on whatever
[00:57:33] um but it's just a [ __ ] on attack
[00:57:34] basically
[00:57:36] there's a description of what Bond of
[00:57:37] life is I didn't actually read this
[00:57:39] healing effects that a character
[00:57:41] receives this will prevent them from
[00:57:43] recovering HP after the character is
[00:57:45] healed from amount equal to the bond the
[00:57:47] bond can be cleared
[00:57:52] oh wait
[00:57:59] I'm looking at this thing
[00:58:01] how long did that take to [ __ ] clear
[00:58:02] okay I see
[00:58:05] okay it makes sense
[00:58:07] I think
[00:58:08] but I don't know why the HP bar there
[00:58:10] wasn't the same as the zoomed in one
[00:58:11] look they're not lined up I don't know
[00:58:12] why but assuming I was looking at this
[00:58:14] one I think it makes sense
[00:58:16] it's basically
[00:58:22] okay so from my understanding you can't
[00:58:24] get healed instead it heals the bond of
[00:58:26] Life basically and then when it's filled
[00:58:27] up that bar disappears and then you gain
[00:58:32] um
[00:58:34] yeah you gain the healing that the bot
[00:58:36] of life you yanked
[00:58:37] [Laughter]
[00:58:40] but while they made
[00:58:43] dude shut the okay I mean true but
[00:58:47] it's basically a negative Shield
[00:58:51] um
[00:58:53] yeah
[00:58:54] so there you go finale of The Deep
[00:58:56] um but even if you ignore the bond of
[00:58:58] Life part
[00:59:00] let's say 24 attack if it doubles but
[00:59:02] maybe it's a bit less let's say 20. 20
[00:59:04] attack plus 27 attack plus a high base
[00:59:07] stock
[00:59:08] it's already a decent option like
[00:59:10] genuinely it's not going to be like
[00:59:11] better than like whatever gotcha sword
[00:59:14] is like you know Fab for supports or
[00:59:16] like whatever the [ __ ]
[00:59:24] 150 flat is a lot it is especially if it
[00:59:27] goes higher than this because like let's
[00:59:28] say you have 2K attack 10 of that's 20.
[00:59:31] uh sorry uh 200 I don't know I said 20.
[00:59:33] I'm stupid but my point is 200 is
[00:59:35] probably around as much as you gain from
[00:59:37] this so it's basically like
[00:59:39] you know I mean you're probably gonna
[00:59:41] have more than 2K attack but if you do
[00:59:43] a decent amount
[00:59:45] [ __ ] 10 attack for free so it's like
[00:59:47] yeah
[00:59:48] I just don't know the exact numbers
[00:59:49] that's why I don't want to add them up
[00:59:50] but like if this is like 10 and this is
[00:59:52] like 20 and then this is 27 it is a lot
[00:59:54] of [ __ ] attack
[00:59:56] so yeah uh but again I'll probably make
[00:59:58] a video on them with like actually more
[01:00:00] information uh but it seems like it's
[01:00:01] decent on like yeah a lot of characters
[01:00:06] uh because like again like I want to
[01:00:07] emphasize this prototype Rancor was a
[01:00:10] fine in like 1.0 like now it's like
[01:00:12] aggravated use iron sing whatever but
[01:00:13] like people are like Oh Brother broncore
[01:00:15] hybrid stack it's fine and like block of
[01:00:16] Sword High Bay stack some crit damage
[01:00:18] effects kind of dog [ __ ] whatever it's
[01:00:20] fine this is kind of like
[01:00:22] Shadows
[01:00:29] someone's a it's actually a cheat weapon
[01:00:32] uh okay with ayako it depends because
[01:00:36] the other weapon makes you need zero ER
[01:00:38] the uh Amino kagayushi you need like no
[01:00:41] ER and icon it's R5 so it it would have
[01:00:43] to depend on how much ER you need
[01:00:46] and the value of sub stats that you're
[01:00:49] saving through the attack in this weapon
[01:00:51] and the ER in the other because I know
[01:00:53] what minoma saves you like 30-ish ER
[01:00:55] because if you don't have it you want
[01:00:57] like 130 to 140 maybe like 40 30 to 40.
[01:01:00] uh whereas this one gives you a lot more
[01:01:02] attack so it could be better if you have
[01:01:03] an fvr it depends
[01:01:05] title shadow
[01:01:07] did I miss wolfang yes you did Fang we
[01:01:09] checked if you were in chat and you
[01:01:10] weren't title Shadow base attack 510
[01:01:13] attack percent 40 a lot now keep in mind
[01:01:15] Chad weapons that have a high base stack
[01:01:17] and a low attack percentage are
[01:01:18] generally better than low base second
[01:01:19] High attack percentage but it's all good
[01:01:21] uh after the character is healed attack
[01:01:24] will be increased by 24 so I'm assuming
[01:01:26] that's 48 at R5 wow and stupid amount of
[01:01:30] attack
[01:01:31] but when we look at blackliff uh not
[01:01:33] black Cliff uh um craftable Claymores
[01:01:36] the sumaru one is ER for like
[01:01:40] like whatever supports or whatever the
[01:01:42] Inazuma one gives you energy
[01:01:46] um
[01:01:47] I think no one [ __ ] uses it Inazuma
[01:01:50] one like I'm trying to remember is it em
[01:01:53] a Zuma Claymore did no one uses the
[01:01:56] unusual Claymore I actually don't
[01:01:57] remember is it ER or em ER right yeah
[01:02:00] okay it is er okay I was right
[01:02:03] yeah it is energy okay I was right
[01:02:04] anyways um and then the the good one is
[01:02:07] the aminess archaic I used to call
[01:02:09] themes the good one but that one
[01:02:12] literally is just a base attack and like
[01:02:13] some attack percent right prototype
[01:02:15] arcade and then one hit it gives you a
[01:02:17] hit every year like x amount of seconds
[01:02:19] but if we look at this
[01:02:21] it's um 27 attack and then a higher base
[01:02:25] tax the higher base stock is nice but
[01:02:26] this one gives you a [ __ ] and then you
[01:02:28] have a small hit which this isn't like
[01:02:29] this is not it's a decent amount it's
[01:02:31] not like negligible but
[01:02:34] um just stats alone this one gives you a
[01:02:35] lot of attack
[01:02:38] X oh no dude [ __ ] you I don't know why
[01:02:40] they renamed it
[01:02:43] anyways it seems like a good blacksmith
[01:02:45] play more
[01:02:46] um
[01:02:50] yeah since I found one
[01:02:55] but it doesn't seem amazing like it's
[01:02:57] just a [ __ ] up attack basically low
[01:02:58] low HP stock engine uploaded really what
[01:03:02] is it I can look it up
[01:03:04] yo this looks sick what the [ __ ] please
[01:03:06] be good it's HP oh wait yeah
[01:03:15] wait HP blacksmith is actually okay I
[01:03:17] didn't read the effect yet but it could
[01:03:18] be a win for hotel Mains unless the
[01:03:21] effect is like
[01:03:22] you know heal yourself but yeah
[01:03:25] you should heal yourself now when the
[01:03:27] wielder is healed again oh it is I mean
[01:03:32] I mean I mean
[01:03:37] I mean
[01:03:40] it's energy
[01:03:43] this could be yeah yeah if you don't
[01:03:44] need Fab on her
[01:03:46] right this could be how Yao
[01:03:49] Yaya wants like she can use that energy
[01:03:51] she doesn't need it but like hpe polar
[01:03:54] energy
[01:03:57] this effect can be triggered once every
[01:03:58] 10 seconds it can occur when the
[01:03:59] character is not on the field
[01:04:03] base attack is high which why wait why
[01:04:06] if you okay usually what weapons are
[01:04:08] made right they're like okay we're gonna
[01:04:10] give you either a high base stack and a
[01:04:12] shitty like small Stat or a shitty base
[01:04:14] stack and then a big like other stat why
[01:04:16] is this a high-based hack with HP
[01:04:23] why couldn't this be the sword oh wait
[01:04:26] actually can we use this as a sword
[01:04:29] people are saying Toma but
[01:04:31] sure actually I mean
[01:04:36] wait is there an ICD on tip of the caulk
[01:04:39] does tip of the [ __ ] have an ICD I guess
[01:04:41] we don't know it's not out but like it
[01:04:42] doesn't say oh once every chance I'm
[01:04:44] stupid how do I not see the 10 seconds
[01:04:46] I'm stupid
[01:04:48] my brain is I'm reading too fast yeah so
[01:04:51] 130 seconds
[01:04:53] so why would you use this over Fab
[01:04:55] what if I don't have fast unlocks
[01:04:58] get a Fab
[01:05:01] um
[01:05:02] yeah the thing with Tomah like this is
[01:05:04] probably fine on Toma as a blacksmith
[01:05:05] option it's probably fine
[01:05:07] um because you get you get shield and a
[01:05:10] decent amount of energy I assume at R5
[01:05:12] this is 16 which now that I say that out
[01:05:14] loud and you can do it once every 10
[01:05:16] seconds
[01:05:16] it's actually not bad
[01:05:19] um
[01:05:20] but
[01:05:21] file gives you energy for your whole
[01:05:23] team it gives you way more energy and
[01:05:24] then in virgin teams like teams where
[01:05:27] Tomah is like really good or like not
[01:05:28] really good because Bob Jones might be
[01:05:30] in the chat but where he's like pretty
[01:05:31] good like he's decent he's virgin and in
[01:05:33] virgin yeah you might want some HP so
[01:05:36] your Shield doesn't just [ __ ] die
[01:05:37] because you take a lot of damage in
[01:05:38] version teams from your own cores but in
[01:05:40] general you want ER and EM more than HP
[01:05:43] HB is still fine you can still go HP but
[01:05:45] ER and Em are better so
[01:05:47] other pull arms could be better but hey
[01:05:49] it looks really [ __ ] sick so I'm
[01:05:51] definitely gonna craft one
[01:05:52] um I'll check the gungeon video just
[01:05:54] give me a second last weapon
[01:05:55] oh no there's two [ __ ] okay what is the

[01:15:02] it's like white and red but here look
[01:15:03] the same no
[01:15:04] maybe I'm stupid I don't know maybe I'm
[01:15:06] dumb Riptide
[01:15:10] yeah no wait is this diff oh I guess it
[01:15:12] oh it's white okay my monitor colors are
[01:15:15] set for valorent so all of my colors are
[01:15:17] distorted I have the blue like a lot
[01:15:19] higher than the others it's hard to tell
[01:15:21] I just look Brown
[01:15:23] like when I look at a thumbnail I put on
[01:15:25] my other monitor because this monitor is
[01:15:26] [ __ ] okay so don't make fun of me but
[01:15:29] yes okay here he does look good at the
[01:15:30] end wherever I could actually see it
[01:15:32] yeah
[01:15:34] why do you think Xiao chose to play the
[01:15:35] short flute oh because Xiao is actually
[01:15:37] a geopolitical statement on the state of
[01:15:40] society so what Charles is associated
[01:15:44] spam picking me saying pause on Albedo
[01:15:46] why did I interrupt my sentence with
[01:15:48] that you know what [ __ ] you I'm pausing
[01:15:50] on okay I guess I'm pausing listen
[01:15:52] ciao using a short flute is like a
[01:15:56] commentary on social constructs he said
[01:15:58] you know what I am an adeptice I can
[01:16:01] choose my form my height my length my
[01:16:03] girth my what I look like what I do
[01:16:06] where I am who I am and yet
[01:16:09] people still perceive me as short even
[01:16:11] though I'm tall because he gains height
[01:16:13] with friendship uh crit damage and
[01:16:15] constellations so keep that in mind but
[01:16:17] anyways so that people that don't really
[01:16:19] appreciate me that don't use me they
[01:16:21] don't level me up level my friendship
[01:16:22] may seem me as as shorter and and that
[01:16:26] social commentary on hey it's not about
[01:16:28] the size of the of the person of the
[01:16:31] package okay it's it's it's it's more
[01:16:33] than that and this is going from someone
[01:16:35] who is tall someone who it can't even
[01:16:37] fit through [ __ ] door frames someone
[01:16:39] met me said zox what the [ __ ] how are
[01:16:41] you this tall
[01:16:43] and I just think that Xiao is such a
[01:16:45] noble soul for proving that hey I can do
[01:16:49] any form but this is what I choose and
[01:16:52] it's not just about oh oh I can't my
[01:16:55] feet don't touch the ground when I sit
[01:16:56] on a chair it's not about that it's
[01:16:58] about hey how high can you jump how far
[01:17:03] can you go after it's not about
[01:17:06] it's not a sin to get knocked down it's
[01:17:10] a sin to not get back up
[01:17:13] that was so smart I'm gonna say it again
[01:17:14] it's not a crime to get to get knocked
[01:17:17] down but it's a sin to not stand back up
[01:17:21] thank you Xiao I'm gonna unlike and then
[01:17:24] re-like this video because I just
[01:17:25] learned a valuable lesson
[01:17:30] Lament
[01:17:31] anyways uh we are currently uh an hour
[01:17:34] in the Stream and I haven't played
[01:17:35] Junction yet stalling

[01:17:43] sorry if I miss anything
[01:17:45] anyways uh as we were saying we were
[01:17:47] reviewing the weapons so uh back to my
[01:17:49] guide voice
[01:17:57] they're like what pie oh my God the pie

[01:18:12] something and if you just tell me I can
[01:18:14] help you out like I like pie pie is good
[01:18:16] but but what's happening here kid around
[01:18:18] this is 70 months
[01:18:20] babes thanks to the prime also my sounds
[01:18:23] are [ __ ] them I am short so he has a
[01:18:25] smaller hit our donors okay are they
[01:18:27] loud because I can't tell and if they're
[01:18:28] loud I can turn on a little
[01:18:30] thanks for wrapping us short people
[01:18:32] along with us I'm not short
[01:18:37] but
[01:18:38] okay
[01:18:39] all right cool
[01:18:41] all right anyways the two uh blacks and
[01:18:43] callus uh weapons I didn't look at first
[01:18:44] all the Catalyst I remember looking at
[01:18:45] this off stream and be like Oh but let's
[01:18:47] look at it so first of all
[01:18:54] uh if we ignore the dragon spine
[01:18:56] Catalyst which isn't a real weapon the
[01:18:58] main other like offensive blacksmith
[01:18:59] catalyst is the map of Mario
[01:19:02] but now there's another one so flying
[01:19:03] dirty High base stock 565 so with that
[01:19:06] percentage then when you use a skill
[01:19:07] your Elemental damage bonus will be
[01:19:09] increased by eight percent probably 16
[01:19:11] out or five maybe twelve but usually
[01:19:13] it's doubled but there's also three
[01:19:15] numbers I don't know if that influences
[01:19:16] it but anyways
[01:19:17] as well then
[01:19:20] get a bond of Life uh which gives you
[01:19:23] Elemental damage one is based on your
[01:19:24] age P or by your healing wait uh
[01:19:28] automatic fee when the bar life is clear
[01:19:30] okay
[01:19:37] okay yeah
[01:19:40] wait I would need to know the exact
[01:19:41] numbers at R5 though because no one's if
[01:19:43] it's a blacksmith you can probably get
[01:19:44] it I don't know if they're gonna use
[01:19:45] like a new Billet that's like impossible
[01:19:47] to get but if if you can actually R5 it
[01:19:49] it'll be a lot uh a lot more percentages
[01:19:52] I assume like I If it's double that's
[01:19:54] [ __ ] huge but anyways High base
[01:19:56] attack attack percentage
[01:19:58] um
[01:20:01] the only weird thing is that it's scales
[01:20:04] on your the bond of life skills on your
[01:20:05] max HP
[01:20:07] um
[01:20:09] which is why it's like why is this
[01:20:10] attack percent then but even if you're
[01:20:13] like a catalyst that doesn't want HP
[01:20:14] what's like do you have a catalyst
[01:20:15] that's gear that's not on HP now he does
[01:20:17] on 17K that's really low catalysts are
[01:20:19] squishy usually but
[01:20:22] I mean
[01:20:26] 24 like
[01:20:28] you'll still get a decent amount of
[01:20:29] damage runs from this map Amari is em
[01:20:33] and then that one gives you 16 right let
[01:20:35] me pull it up
[01:20:36] yeah memory an R5 is 16 I don't know uh
[01:20:41] wait two stacks 32 never mind I lied 32.
[01:20:44] um what is that R1 yeah yeah okay R1
[01:20:47] it's 16 and then 32 at R5
[01:20:50] um but this one gives you em
[01:20:55] lower HP is equal to easier to clear
[01:20:57] Bond of Life equal easier to get passive
[01:21:01] yeah but it's every 1000 HP but it also
[01:21:03] caps at I don't know if this changes
[01:21:06] that R5 it's hard to tell
[01:21:09] do you have a similar weapon in
[01:21:10] refinements what does Amber do no that's
[01:21:13] different
[01:21:14] um
[01:21:20] hmm
[01:21:24] this one all three go up quite
[01:21:26] significantly
[01:21:30] literally double right yeah
[01:21:32] yeah ah we can just assume it doubles
[01:21:54] yeah like let's say this is all my
[01:21:56] nahita I don't know he don't want an
[01:21:57] attack weapon but let's just use it as
[01:21:59] an example because she's level 90 so the
[01:22:00] HP is like kind of accurate
[01:22:02] let's say it's like 17K
[01:22:06] 24 would be 4K right
[01:22:09] which in every 1000 is two percent let's
[01:22:12] say four percent let's assume it doubles
[01:22:14] this is four times uh one k so it'd be
[01:22:17] four times four so 16.
[01:22:21] um
[01:22:22] right yeah
[01:22:24] which is not wait but up to a maximum of
[01:22:26] 12. oh no no the maximum will scale up
[01:22:28] too let's say it's two then it's half uh
[01:22:31] but this has to be double so it's
[01:22:32] probably up to maximum 24 so you get 16
[01:22:34] plus
[01:22:36] whatever the [ __ ] this is I assume 16.
[01:22:39] so that could be like let's say 16 times
[01:22:42] two plus this is actually a good amount
[01:22:44] of stats
[01:22:46] but I'm also tired right now so I might
[01:22:48] be stupid but this looks like a lot of
[01:22:49] stats
[01:22:57] you need 25 gauge if you take out the
[01:22:58] passive yeah but uh you also don't need
[01:23:01] you don't need to cap it
[01:23:04] because so uh map of Mario does give you
[01:23:07] more so mama will give you well actually
[01:23:09] maybe not it depends if this is R5 it
[01:23:10] might not actually give you more never
[01:23:11] mind but
[01:23:12] my mind gives you 32 so if you want em
[01:23:14] you go this and then if you don't want
[01:23:16] it I want to attack which a lot of
[01:23:17] calendars do this actually looks really
[01:23:19] good
[01:23:23] it's a maximum of 12 yeah but this is R1
[01:23:25] all the numbers I said were assuming at
[01:23:27] R5 doubles but I don't know maybe people
[01:23:29] like oh actually susk it doesn't but
[01:23:32] assuming it doubles this is probably a
[01:23:33] Max 24 right it wouldn't be a Max of 12
[01:23:35] still
[01:23:37] and if all that is true then this
[01:23:38] actually looks really good
[01:23:42] anyways I don't want to go too much into
[01:23:45] it because I'll probably make a video on
[01:23:46] it so there's no point in ranting but
[01:23:48] I'm happy for it uh this is the bow is
[01:23:50] the last one you look at
[01:23:52] it always doubles though uh not always
[01:23:54] but usually it does
[01:23:57] because I know that I remember looking
[01:23:58] at weapons that are exceptions I don't
[01:24:00] know if I can name one off the top of my
[01:24:01] head but I know that some don't all the
[01:24:03] time
[01:24:04] but usually they do
[01:24:06] scar weapon attacks who doesn't double
[01:24:07] there you go
[01:24:10] the Bell dude why you know what the
[01:24:12] bell's refinements are
[01:24:16] oh yeah sock is a good uh
[01:24:23] wait what the [ __ ] wait I actually want
[01:24:25] to look at the Bell where is the Bell
[01:24:26] who's it on it's probably on Dory
[01:24:29] nope never mind
[01:24:35] what is that battle refinement [ __ ] it's
[01:24:37] already refined I'm stupid I have I have
[01:24:39] R1 Bell for sure yeah I do
[01:24:42] so uh uh yeah it's [ __ ] plus three
[01:24:44] well I mean 20 it's not gonna Max it's
[01:24:46] not gonna multiply your HP from 20 to 40
[01:24:48] but like the The Shield I guess
[01:24:52] yeah the other stuff don't even go down
[01:24:55] oh no it does 15. this is the seconds
[01:24:58] anyways sorry I'm getting distracted
[01:24:59] yeah okay start with still this this
[01:25:01] looks [ __ ] sick uh I really like how
[01:25:03] this looks
[01:25:05] okay baystack not super high not super
[01:25:08] low kinda in the middle
[01:25:10] 100 after the wielder is healed they
[01:25:12] gain 16 more damage probably 32 lasts
[01:25:16] eight seconds can be triggered when the
[01:25:18] character is not on field
[01:25:20] um that's a lot of damage
[01:25:31] ah
[01:25:34] I mean like you know
[01:25:45] it's gonna be weird like let's say you
[01:25:47] start a rotation right
[01:25:49] your official is going to be full HP you
[01:25:51] use Oz it snapshots to like your stats
[01:25:54] your Buffs whatever
[01:25:55] so it's like you're gonna need to get
[01:25:58] healed either before you summon Oz or
[01:26:00] you re-summon Oz after getting healed
[01:26:02] which is kind of weird
[01:26:04] um
[01:26:08] yeah it might be some like Hydro archon
[01:26:10] stuff
[01:26:13] if this is 30 damage the stats are fine
[01:26:15] like you'd still probably like like I
[01:26:17] know Crescent hamayumi are both good for
[01:26:18] like what they're good at but
[01:26:23] this was a no official doesn't get
[01:26:25] another buff okay shut up but like yeah
[01:26:29] um who would use this
[01:26:33] let me look up Hama yumi's percentages
[01:26:34] are five
[01:26:42] yeah that's a lot of [ __ ] notes for
[01:26:44] some
[01:26:49] yeah also you might have stringless
[01:26:52] stringless is kind of cracked but
[01:26:56] yeah free to play official bow I guess
[01:26:58] but you have to like make sure you're
[01:26:59] snapshotting this you're always it's
[01:27:01] kind of hard it might not be hard but if
[01:27:03] you start a rotation you're full HP if
[01:27:05] you start Abyss so you have to like
[01:27:07] grief yourself or something I don't know
[01:27:09] yeah it is what it is
[01:27:14] wait why does this look like a bird so
[01:27:16] this is the bird icon for Twitter and
[01:27:18] then this is X why are they different
[01:27:23] why does Twitter have two logos
[01:27:30] does that include overflow healing it
[01:27:32] shouldn't maybe [ __ ] fontan's gonna
[01:27:35] be like oh [ __ ] you we heal you whatever
[01:27:37] you want but
[01:27:39] usually when it's a character is healed
[01:27:41] that shouldn't be like if you're full HP
[01:27:42] you're not healed
[01:27:47] but I could be wrong
[01:27:52] anyways uh overall I'll make this into
[01:27:55] I'll make a video out of this at some
[01:27:56] point uh soon but I want to make
[01:27:58] character guides first but I think I'll
[01:27:59] do a video on the free to play swords
[01:28:00] and I'll video I wanted to do two in one
[01:28:02] but I think comparing battle pass
[01:28:04] weapons is probably a smart video so it
[01:28:05] might be two I don't know maybe one
[01:28:07] we'll see uh but for now there's a lot
[01:28:10] of a lot of [ __ ] I like this this but it
[01:28:12] doesn't look good on current characters
[01:28:13] looks like a future character thing
[01:28:14] unless there's someone forgetting about
[01:28:15] which could be possible
[01:28:17] um
[01:28:18] and then for the blacks of the ones I
[01:28:20] really like the Catalyst I think the
[01:28:21] Catalyst looks cool and then
[01:28:27] I think Claymore looked decent
[01:28:31] and sword as well yeah I like to sword a
[01:28:34] lot too
[01:28:35] yeah we'll see uh now I still haven't
[01:28:38] played gunshot it's been like an hour
[01:28:39] and a half so we're gonna speed around
[01:28:40] the world against all and then we're
[01:28:41] gonna get together okay stop spamming me

[01:32:10] been just chatting dude maybe I should
[01:32:12] do variety this has been just chatting
[01:32:14] for [ __ ] an hour and a half we look

[01:33:43] also has a bit of base attack like uh
[01:33:44] attack scaling but
[01:33:47] um
[01:33:48] it's mostly for the time level
[01:33:54] or resin's capped

[01:33:57] literally started stream uncapped I I
[01:33:59] know I was about to be 160. I spent 20.
[01:34:03] I was 140
[01:34:05] I think I'm pretty I'm like 90 sure I
[01:34:08] just spent 20.
[01:34:10] and then I recapped
[01:34:16] have you seen what genres dropped the
[01:34:17] trailer at the uh concert thing yeah
[01:34:20] we're gonna go do uh actually let's do

[01:34:38] battle yo okay listen listen we are
[01:34:41] gonna finish it it says I know it's one
[01:34:43] day left but we actually can finish it
[01:34:45] because look at all that look look
[01:34:46] there's actually a lot of things to do
[01:34:48] and there's this we can actually finish
[01:34:49] it we can actually finish it so I know
[01:34:52] it's gonna be hard but we can uh also I
[01:34:55] claimed the free wishes so we can do
[01:34:57] free single polls I waited for you guys
[01:34:58] I didn't pull off stream because I'm a
[01:34:59] good streamer I waited for you guys I
[01:35:01] would never uh pull without you
[01:35:03] the last time I did a Singapore without
[01:35:05] you I got bailou
[01:35:07] sorry
[01:35:11] I'll guess the weapon I'll guess the
[01:35:12] weapon just from the silhouette watch
[01:35:15] a slingshot I'm too good
[01:35:18] dude my brain forgot the name of the
[01:35:20] weapon but I said it like I was like I
[01:35:22] don't know what that's called and I said
[01:35:23] slingshot that's like dude it's like
[01:35:25] it's like the The Reflex like the
[01:35:27] instinct
[01:35:28] but I'll say it again I'll say again
[01:35:30] watch
[01:35:32] uh Sky Rider I'm too good I'm too good
[01:35:34] I'm too good I'm too good I'm actually
[01:35:36] good
[01:35:37] what if I just do one single pull build
[01:35:39] pity surely I'm gonna skip though okay
[01:35:40] gold block Castle can't Max the past BQ
[01:35:43] Ace of weekly exp
[01:35:47] does not actually apply when it comes in
[01:35:50] uh
[01:35:52] uh uh when you factor in that first of
[01:35:56] all uh the XP I have left is like six
[01:35:58] levels but also the battle pass period
[01:36:00] ones don't go there so if we do uh two
[01:36:03] plus let's say three let's say four
[01:36:05] maybe
[01:36:06] should be enough
[01:36:07] also I could make I could do 50 wishes
[01:36:09] but I don't want to this one is
[01:36:11] literally bait it's bait for me to
[01:36:13] [ __ ] build pity
[01:36:15] but I should be able to
[01:36:17] even if I hit the weekly cap I should be
[01:36:18] able to
[01:36:23] I'm not I'm not wishing
[01:36:29] uh also we're playing our friendship
[01:36:30] team which is nilu [ __ ] Kirara and baiju
[01:36:49] Chad I want to make a the 100K resin on
[01:36:52] Vermillion video but I don't know if I
[01:36:54] should do that I was gonna do it before
[01:36:55] front end but I might wait and then
[01:36:56] after we do some strong box too then I
[01:36:59] can do a video of the 100K resume but
[01:37:01] also some of the strong box that my
[01:37:02] shadow actually is good true true
[01:37:10] okay listen listen
[01:37:13] mods you guys do a grueling task and you
[01:37:16] do an amazing job at it but I just saw
[01:37:18] someone get bongs for typing the song
[01:37:20] lyric
[01:37:22] like Kendrick just said like
[01:37:25] okay
[01:37:31] my bad guys all good
[01:37:38] as a psychology student I can say this
[01:37:40] man has ADHD okay first of all before
[01:37:43] you diagnose me
[01:37:45] graduate yeah first graduate
[01:37:52] what is this
[01:37:55] the one run today well this is how we're
[01:37:56] starting the [ __ ] is this
[01:38:03] um okay maybe today's a lucky day though
[01:38:05] because this is like good substance
[01:38:06] we'll do one more I wasn't gonna like
[01:38:08] farm right now but we'll do one more
[01:38:15] I'm a cat and a parcel at the same time
[01:38:17] I'm a cat box
[01:38:20] wait I'm supposed to be prepping for
[01:38:22] fonten today why am I why am I in
[01:38:24] Vermillion
[01:38:25] that is a curious question
[01:38:32] dude I feel like baija's release was
[01:38:33] like everyone's talking about how they
[01:38:35] like baiju before he came out and it's
[01:38:36] kind of he's been under the radar
[01:38:38] no one dude no one's without dude no one
[01:38:41] talks about my juice
[01:38:53] watch this watches watch this
[01:38:55] [ __ ] I I was trying to claim during
[01:38:59] that's not curator is so sick I actually
[01:39:02] like her yeah
[01:39:06] well I mean
[01:39:08] so that's how we're starting today okay
[01:39:10] I have a theory we've gotten we did two
[01:39:12] runs only two and we got two pieces with
[01:39:14] critical damage and then another gets
[01:39:16] out so my theory is we're getting good
[01:39:18] artifacts today we just have to be lucky
[01:39:19] on which artifact it is so we go again
[01:39:23] one more
[01:39:27] locking a four star locking four stars
[01:39:29] in Vermilion is smart because when
[01:39:31] strongbox comes out everyone's gonna
[01:39:33] have a good Vermillion Chow right but
[01:39:35] only the ogs will have a good four star
[01:39:38] set because if you strong box you can't
[01:39:40] get four stars so having good four stars
[01:39:42] proves that I didn't just buy good Xiao
[01:39:45] I didn't just so I didn't just cheat my
[01:39:48] way to it I actually worked with my own
[01:39:51] sweat and labor
[01:39:54] true it's like an achievement
[01:40:00] it's like oh okay you have a good Chow
[01:40:03] okay but do you have but do you have but
[01:40:05] do you have 675 child lanterns didn't
[01:40:08] [ __ ] think so didn't think so also we
[01:40:11] have to use our parametric uh I I
[01:40:13] noticed it wasn't used off stream so I
[01:40:14] was like I'll do it
[01:40:17] I should have made more I didn't think I
[01:40:19] thought it would come back every year so
[01:40:21] I just made like however many I should
[01:40:22] have made like [ __ ] 10 000. I wish I
[01:40:24] wish like if I knew it was limited I
[01:40:26] would have made like 10K
[01:40:30] is it too late to run away
[01:40:33] Yes actually you already subbed and
[01:40:36] typed them out even just being here it's
[01:40:38] already too late the conversion has
[01:40:39] begun I'm sorry
[01:40:42] oh okay well I guess you didn't get a
[01:40:44] good artifact so we can leave if none of
[01:40:46] the artifacts are good it's a sign to
[01:40:47] leave and I wouldn't ignore a sign
[01:40:50] this could be good uh flat defense on
[01:40:52] Gambler so defense on gamblers not bad
[01:40:54] because you can use two-piece Gambler on
[01:40:55] Albedo because you want skill damage
[01:40:57] also I don't know why I just realized
[01:40:59] this the new sets we're getting right
[01:41:01] gilded golden troop and [ __ ] Marie
[01:41:03] Jose aren't they just five star Gambler
[01:41:05] and five star Berserker you remember
[01:41:06] dude I've said this probably two years
[01:41:08] ago that if shot like if there was a
[01:41:11] five star Berserker set it would
[01:41:12] unironically be broken on ciao and we
[01:41:14] literally got a five-star Berserker set
[01:41:16] and five star Gambler because official
[01:41:18] needed another buff
[01:41:20] Shirley
[01:41:26] oh did I say instructor
[01:41:28] I meant to say Gambler I don't know so I
[01:41:30] I maybe I'm getting baited oh no someone
[01:41:32] just mod checked instructor never mind I
[01:41:34] got baited yeah no no it's gambling
[01:41:36] I don't remember what I say dude is this
[01:41:39] a problem should I see a doctor like is
[01:41:41] this actually like am I like do I have
[01:41:43] memory loss I literally I'm not even
[01:41:45] joking by the way I don't remember what
[01:41:47] the [ __ ] I say and then it sucks because
[01:41:49] like someone will be like yo but you
[01:41:51] told me this and I'm like I because then
[01:41:54] it's like okay let's say I'm like I'm
[01:41:56] like talking to someone right or like
[01:41:57] arguing or whatever not arguing like
[01:41:58] let's say let's like let's say I'm
[01:41:59] talking with zaj and I'm like yo
[01:42:03] let's stop talking okay and I'm like
[01:42:05] like they're like yo you told me this
[01:42:07] and then I don't know if I said that so
[01:42:10] then I have two choices either I gas
[01:42:13] like them and I'm like I didn't say that
[01:42:14] because I don't remember or I'm like
[01:42:16] okay and then I defend something that I
[01:42:18] don't even know if I said so then what
[01:42:19] what happens well I don't know do I just
[01:42:21] believe it I I said that I'm sorry I
[01:42:30] okay maybe Vermillion is not
[01:42:34] never mind one more run
[01:42:36] what's your common build full Em Sock
[01:42:38] Rags we're playing her in a bloom team
[01:42:40] right yeah
[01:42:47] yeah was your honest opinion on nilo
[01:42:48] Bloom team I like it it's like
[01:42:52] I want to say it's niche because I know
[01:42:55] that it can be like the wienot wasn't
[01:42:56] very fun but so far has been able to
[01:42:58] clear everything so like it's niche
[01:42:59] because you want a lot of enemies and
[01:43:01] you want the enemies to be able to group
[01:43:02] for you ideally but I mean it works and
[01:43:05] you don't need like it's pretty like
[01:43:07] accessible too ideally you have Nikita
[01:43:09] but even without her it's like pretty
[01:43:11] like free play friendly teams
[01:43:14] so I mean I mean I like her
[01:43:21] you know Target bosses where she's worse
[01:43:23] or like hey if you don't have a [ __ ]
[01:43:26] pyro or whatever character then [ __ ] you
[01:43:29] and then nearly teams are a bit more
[01:43:30] like restricted but yeah
[01:43:33] I do think they're very fun
[01:43:36] your hair looks like an entrance to a
[01:43:38] castle
[01:43:40] I don't even know what that means
[01:43:43] that's not funny it's actually not funny
[01:43:45] what I do like about nilu though to
[01:43:48] change the subject is that stop saying
[01:43:50] true what I do like about nilu is that a
[01:43:52] lot of like
[01:43:53] single Target dps's I I like but people
[01:43:56] could be like you could say like hey
[01:43:57] just [ __ ] use hyperboom and you don't
[01:43:59] need them true but with blue it's like
[01:44:01] AOE so it's like
[01:44:03] a bit more valuable uh I will say
[01:44:07] matter of fact inventory is full because
[01:44:09] we're saving for strong box in Fontan
[01:44:11] Vermilion now you might be like socks
[01:44:15] you have no like
[01:44:17] so actually okay
[01:44:26] a friend of mine Sam who uh is an editor
[01:44:28] we were trialing our trialing currently
[01:44:30] for the strawbox series he added the
[01:44:31] last one if you like it let me know good
[01:44:33] feedback it's appreciate it he told me
[01:44:35] sucks you're gonna make up for Millions
[01:44:36] drama with you right yeah okay you have
[01:44:39] a lot of artifacts saved up right like
[01:44:40] hundreds maybe maybe you could title the
[01:44:42] video I spent a thousand artifacts
[01:44:43] because you have so many probably a
[01:44:44] thousand you can throw uh like you know
[01:44:46] as you farm okay
[01:44:50] um how are you gonna level them if your
[01:44:52] inventory is all five stars that's my
[01:44:53] only question and then I was like wait a
[01:44:54] second how the [ __ ] am I gonna level
[01:44:56] them so I might have to do something
[01:44:58] where we like strong box and then I go
[01:45:00] farm the new set and then I go back to
[01:45:02] the straw box and level they're like the
[01:45:03] video might be recorded in the middle of
[01:45:04] two like it might be like strong box and
[01:45:06] then Farm the new domain and then
[01:45:08] strongbox level and then more like it
[01:45:11] might be scum but what I was realizing
[01:45:13] is I shouldn't be destroying these
[01:45:15] pieces I should feed them into a five
[01:45:17] star that I'm then gonna feed into the
[01:45:19] new strongbox pieces does that make
[01:45:21] sense
[01:45:21] so for example we like level a piece
[01:45:24] that like looks good so like this I mean
[01:45:27] maybe it might get crit rate like this
[01:45:28] we Auto add in and then if it's bad we
[01:45:31] save it and we fodder it into a new A
[01:45:35] Whole New World
[01:45:38] the the new pieces so I got er I mean
[01:45:41] we'll just [ __ ] auto it doesn't
[01:45:42] matter
[01:45:46] someone said you won't need fodder
[01:45:47] because you won't get any good piece to
[01:45:49] upgrade
[01:45:50] mods find that guy bat him then see if
[01:45:52] any of his friends or family members are
[01:45:54] in the chat ban them too
[01:45:56] actually no before you bend them message
[01:45:58] them be like hey man just want to see
[01:46:00] like how are you doing is there anything
[01:46:01] is there is there any streamer you like
[01:46:03] then find any other streamer they like
[01:46:04] ban them there too hi
[01:46:07] be like hey I represent ziox please
[01:46:09] please okay sorry
[01:46:12] I'm sorry
[01:46:13] uh I don't like this piece so we're
[01:46:15] gonna just throw it
[01:46:17] should we level this [ __ ] it
[01:46:19] wait is anyone ever gonna use this
[01:46:26] I mean am I a real ER
[01:46:33] five
[01:46:37] I mean
[01:46:44] what's a gene bro Jean skills I mean
[01:46:48] I guess but you want crit on Gene if
[01:46:50] you're building Gene give her damage
[01:47:05] [ __ ] it
[01:47:13] uh Tesla so that's fine but use fav over
[01:47:16] sharpshooter's oath
[01:47:18] if you have it we already alone
[01:47:22] that's pretty tasty that could be good
[01:47:24] for fav uh I want to see if I have
[01:47:26] another healing about a circuit that I
[01:47:27] never use that I could feed into this
[01:47:28] one because this one's probably better
[01:47:31] oh what if I'm playing
[01:47:34] prototype Amber nahida prototype
[01:47:37] prototype Amber Clee we go healing bonus
[01:47:40] and throwing Tails no wait you can't
[01:47:42] throw a thousand per time Amber but we
[01:47:44] go healing bonus
[01:47:46] for instructor one Vermillion
[01:47:58] if I have another healing bonus or good
[01:48:00] I'll throw it
[01:48:06] why don't I have healing bonus almost as
[01:48:08] if it's a bad stat no surely not surely
[01:48:10] I wouldn't make a bad decision on stream
[01:48:11] surely not right
[01:48:13] surely
[01:48:21] okay I actually don't have a feeling
[01:48:25] sort it
[01:48:28] why did they do that
[01:48:36] wait
[01:48:38] I don't have any
[01:48:40] I might be locked I guess
[01:48:45] no I don't have any
[01:48:52] oh
[01:48:56] what should I do should I actually level
[01:48:57] this dude no way you're dude no way you
[01:49:00] guys let me level this right
[01:49:04] how am I still on this page

[01:49:13] okay somehow it got the only stat we
[01:49:16] didn't want no I mean it's I mean for
[01:49:18] healing wasn't even bad but like
[01:49:20] I don't even know what I wanted I'm
[01:49:22] gonna be honest I don't think that
[01:49:23] artifact could have been good why am I
[01:49:24] in a domain right now how the [ __ ] did I
[01:49:26] just do Vermillion
[01:49:28] I thought
[01:49:29] I don't know one more
[01:49:39] it's gonna be good could get her damage
[01:49:42] if there's no good peace I'll leave

[02:13:15] that's fine
[02:13:19] okay there's an ICD on Pepe W's because
[02:13:21] if you guys are pepew now then if I add
[02:13:22] something to you it won't stack up so I
[02:13:24] might as well do another refresh before

[02:13:37] just remembered Chad
[02:13:39] listen because fontan's coming out I
[02:13:42] might go a little bit harder on streams

[02:13:45] with that in mind now you better not
[02:13:46] type dies of cringe
[02:13:48] um because our YouTube shorts are kind
[02:13:51] of popping people really like them and I
[02:13:53] love making them well I love uploading
[02:13:55] them Allen edits them so I can't take
[02:13:57] too much credit for it but I do like the
[02:13:59] idea of it
[02:14:00] we're going to be making more and
[02:14:01] there's a decent chance we re-upload
[02:14:03] them on Tick Tock now listen listen
[02:14:05] listen I won't be there I am here I'm
[02:14:09] happy and we're also gonna curate them
[02:14:10] to where there's nothing that's gonna
[02:14:12] like upset anyone but
[02:14:16] I never said hey I'm gonna do it listen
[02:14:19] I'm just saying it is wasted content if
[02:14:22] I don't re-upload it it's literally
[02:14:24] wasted content I I'm just saying so it's
[02:14:28] not listen I'm not listen I'm just
[02:14:31] saying
[02:14:33] there are a lot of nice people
[02:14:37] there's a lot of cool people
[02:14:48] so we might re-upload them and by we I
[02:14:51] mean Alan who's my uh short editor and
[02:14:53] he also helps with guide videos he's a
[02:14:55] giga chat very nice person I met him a
[02:14:57] few times so he will be managing that if

[02:15:03] also don't see a downside like I'm not
[02:15:05] gonna be like like I don't see a
[02:15:07] downside the only thing is I don't I've
[02:15:09] seen like toxicity but like I've also
[02:15:12] seen that
[02:15:14] on like Twitter

[02:26:26] not everyone is a millionaire to go C6
[02:26:28] farzan yeah and that's why I don't like

[02:26:44] a hole everywhere there's a [ __ ]
[02:26:46] paper thin not paper then straw thin
[02:26:48] that was an example it's like you're

[02:27:52] like note it like there could be a good
[02:27:54] like you know but I'm just saying like I
[02:27:55] would I would play more
[02:28:08] I would not vote for her

[02:28:16] extra option for every character where
[02:28:18] it's like language like English Japanese
[02:28:20] Chinese Korean xylox and then you click
[02:28:23] on me and I'm voicing it
[02:28:25] it can actually transcend the language
[02:28:27] barrier because I could like listen
[02:28:28] listen
[02:28:30] any language that could be any language
[02:28:34] any language also that was fast as [ __ ]
[02:28:36] wow

[02:29:52] okay that's a ciao
[02:29:54] attack weapon is actually good then
[02:29:59] what's your nilu weapon
[02:30:01] my nilu is uh with Hydra resonance over
[02:30:05] 60 khp on a dull blade level one
[02:30:08] tolerance because nilu is uh is an icon
[02:30:12] that doesn't need a good uh weapon to do
[02:30:16] well she's just uh she just need some HP
[02:30:28] dude what I know you're not talking I
[02:30:32] know you're not talking I know this
[02:30:34] guy's not talking Lilo clears half the
[02:30:36] characters on here oh wait there's
[02:30:39] actually another player then all right I
[02:30:40] just got baited to look at their nilu
[02:30:42] this guy is thinking [ __ ] six steps
[02:30:43] ahead this guy's thinking six steps
[02:30:45] ahead
[02:30:47] I got baited to click on their R5 nilu
[02:30:49] why is your new R5
[02:30:52] this guy's thinking this guy's playing
[02:30:54] [ __ ] 5D chess
[02:30:57] um
[02:30:58] is that your only R5 weapon come on down
[02:31:02] like I said I want HP
[02:31:07] um
[02:31:13] how much HP does she have oh I could
[02:31:15] check most humans could have the
[02:31:17] entirety of their fleeting lives 75
[02:31:28] 40 em is
[02:31:30] concerning Dot
[02:31:33] but I mean you know there's not trying
[02:31:34] to bloom it just kind of happens by
[02:31:35] accident
[02:31:50] she has more yam with key yeah but
[02:31:51] that's not the point the point is with
[02:31:53] key usually uh when you're past 75k HP
[02:31:56] It capture passive right so what you can
[02:31:57] do is you can go like flop or you can
[02:31:59] try to like get some other stuff it's
[02:32:00] like em or maximize stuff that's not HP
[02:32:02] because there's no real Point once you
[02:32:04] cap your passive true true good take
[02:32:06] okay it is uh thanks for that wait no we
[02:32:08] need to do another
[02:32:09] let's do
[02:32:13] scaramuki

[02:32:37] forbidden that is the forbidden question
[02:32:41] that is the forbidden question

[02:32:45] hydro offfield usually like Barbara or
[02:32:47] kokomi on full em
[02:32:49] but some teams is like then like
[02:32:51] sometimes it's just everyone sometimes
[02:32:54] sometimes it just happens even in those
[02:32:56] teams sometimes it's just anyone but you
[02:32:58] try to make it on one character that's
[02:32:59] stacking em simply not the way the world
[02:33:02] works

[03:05:51] we are the first coined the term that
[03:05:53] sky is hooks in 1.1 but Piero was the
[03:05:56] one who told scarra that sky is fake and
[03:05:59] you have to investigate so maybe Piero
[03:06:02] knows about Skye in teviat which we
[03:06:04] don't also if you go into Abyss there is
[03:06:07] Moon closer to you than in here which
[03:06:09] means that heavy at is upside down
[03:06:19] all right
[03:06:21] wait so we're in Australia
[03:06:24] if tavat is upside down or is this just
[03:06:26] Australia that's pretty cool I actually

[03:18:44] we've done
[03:18:45] buy a seven six five four three and one
[03:18:49] and then two the only thing we can do is
[03:18:50] the hilly Turtle away because I don't
[03:18:51] really want to kill Hillary but we will
[03:18:53] eventually
[03:18:56] [ __ ]
[03:18:58] wait it shows how many Abyss clears
[03:19:00] you've done
[03:19:01] okay but I reset a lot like usually if I
[03:19:04] need a clear I do first half and then
[03:19:05] second half I reset I wish it showed
[03:19:07] attempts but holy [ __ ]
[03:19:09] the hell
[03:19:12] it's a lot but like as I said a lot of
[03:19:15] times it's like I'll do like 12-3 and
[03:19:17] then I won't do second half but dude
[03:19:18] almost 300 holy [ __ ]
[03:19:23] this one
[03:19:29] I've seen all stars and spiral Abyss
[03:19:31] October 2020. that's kind of late I feel
[03:19:34] like I installed that I remember
[03:19:35] stalling that for a while because I
[03:19:37] wanted to level my kitchen
[03:19:42] shovel has 2000 clears that's a sanest
[03:19:44] so Jeff viewer
[03:19:46] also I I literally never finish it
[03:19:52] so highest damage is probably not very
[03:19:54] high
[03:19:55] I don't I've never really like I've done
[03:19:58] 400k on Xiao for 50 but I don't really
[03:20:00] bait for damage
[03:20:02] I don't even know how to check it's in
[03:20:04] um like Adventure Series right
[03:20:08] where the [ __ ] is Adventure
[03:20:16] punish
[03:20:19] now 750. see I'm not a Eula main Eula
[03:20:22] made or have a million

[03:20:36] what is this cat I like that
[03:20:42] okay anyways I mean I'm actually wait
[03:20:44] are there any like hard achievements
[03:20:45] that we can do because we did hero Abyss
[03:20:48] well this is easy but hero and
[03:20:50] Challenger is there any other that's
[03:20:51] like combat
[03:20:53] because all these are like questing or
[03:20:54] like teapot like I can do these if I
[03:20:56] want but so I think that's like
[03:20:59] level 20 level 10.
[03:21:02] oh unless you mean like in different
[03:21:03] like places
[03:21:08] Elemental one oh that one didn't people
[03:21:11] make custom events for that I should
[03:21:13] have done that

[03:21:55] exploration knowledge because uh I was
[03:21:57] [ __ ] resinless and I would stream
[03:21:58] like still four hours so I'd have to
[03:22:00] like explore yep cross times

[03:24:45] know because I've never like I've never
[03:24:47] used a [ __ ] react like a super

[04:05:43] Game Dev quit so the only thing that
[04:05:45] happened in the whole time that we
[04:05:46] stopped development was the [ __ ]
[04:05:48] lawsuit aware and other than that okay
[04:05:50] well uh who knows what happened uh guess
[04:05:52] what Genji has less ammo now so have fun
[04:05:54] playing your dog should character idiot
[04:05:56] okay well now I can't play OverWatch
[04:05:58] that's like if they said hey we're gonna
[04:06:00] stop releasing characters and we're
[04:06:02] gonna wait for Genji and impact two
[04:06:04] that's
[04:06:11] can you imagine
[04:06:17] and so it's like I get it it's like yeah
[04:06:19] obviously the people there now that are
[04:06:21] like working on the game that they
[04:06:23] already that other people killed it's
[04:06:25] not their fault like don't be mean to
[04:06:27] them I get it but also it's like
[04:06:30] that's not a shield you can't be like oh
[04:06:33] we're under Fire well we fired some
[04:06:34] people so now we're it's like dude like
[04:06:36] what you want to just now we're supposed
[04:06:38] to just be nice like yeah they killed
[04:06:39] the game I like but hey it's all good
[04:06:41] it's no big deal
[04:06:47] anyways
[04:06:55] I was in open armor not yet
[04:06:58] okay I just

[04:07:28] we're gonna level a five-star piece that
[04:07:30] we can throw it into our strong box
[04:07:31] pieces when we have to level them
[04:07:34] no we can't strongbox we're waiting for
[04:07:36] 4.0 that's the point it's like have as
[04:07:38] many artifacts for 4.0 strongbox and
[04:07:40] then instantly [ __ ] Let It Rip but
[04:07:42] what we need is we need artifact this
[04:07:43] piece we're gonna feed it all into four
[04:07:44] stars into five stars I mean
[04:07:49] maybe I should do like one strong box on

[04:21:03] one oh 27 again one two three 27.2s the
[04:21:09] [ __ ]
[04:21:11] this is better if you're a crit value
[04:21:12] Andy this attack percent and yeah might
[04:21:15] actually be better than the crit rate
[04:21:16] though if you're like uh
[04:21:18] I guess depending on the character but
[04:21:19] yeah
[04:21:21] this one looks nicer so

[04:22:02] and they're not gonna give her another
[04:22:04] set why would they buff Fishel so yeah

[04:27:16] birthday tomorrow but I don't want her
[04:27:18] to come on Fontana release so we're
[04:27:19] doing something tomorrow morning
[04:27:21] uh and then after I'm gonna have to
[04:27:22] start recording stuff for like the
[04:27:24] characters coming out like just because
[04:27:26] I should probably pre even if they're
[04:27:27] not out I should pre-records himself so
[04:27:29] that I'm not rushing so I don't know if
[04:27:32] I can stream but I'm for sure grind
[04:27:35] streaming when fontan's out I might do a
[04:27:37] stream before from 10 I might not no
[04:27:39] promises I'll let you guys know but the
[04:27:40] day font that's not 15 I'm streaming the
[04:27:42] next day I'm also streaming and then
[04:27:44] that week I'm gonna be grinding I might
[04:27:48] I might go to New York
[04:27:51] on the 19th for whatever the 819 thing
[04:27:54] was remember when they teased that I
[04:27:55] don't know if I will
[04:27:57] it's not like sponsored I just might go
[04:27:59] because it might be a big thing
[04:28:01] but it'll only be for like a day two
[04:28:02] days three days four days five days I'm
[04:28:04] kidding but it might be like a little
[04:28:05] bit and I'd stream there anyways but
[04:28:06] outside of that I'm gonna be grinding
[04:28:08] here
[04:28:09] uh and expect two
[04:28:13] video okay I might need your input on
[04:28:15] video stuff so I might ask in the
[04:28:17] Discord or just on Twitch but right now
[04:28:19] the plan is I'm doing Lenny Lynette
[04:28:20] Hydra MC facial guides we're also doing
[04:28:27] review on a whale account review which
[04:28:29] I'll open up as Fontana out also I want
[04:28:31] to bring my free to play account I want
[04:28:33] to transform it and document the journey
[04:28:36] also
[04:28:38] second Channel bangers if you're not
[04:28:40] subscribe to the second Channel go watch
[04:28:41] it low-key better than my main uh all
[04:28:43] good though for Monet also get a guy but
[04:28:45] that's second half he's not coming
[04:28:46] instantly so that's like in a while same
[04:28:49] with like child drawing me whatever
[04:28:50] right
[04:29:00] so I'm not sure but they're probably a
[04:29:02] video on the new weapons probably
[04:29:06] then rerun videos all that stuff
[04:29:09] I have a few other videos uh the new
[04:29:12] strong box we're gonna make Vermillion
[04:29:13] strawbox that's gonna be a video
[04:29:16] the new artifact sets when they come out
[04:29:18] we are spending
[04:29:20] in ungodly amount of resin I have 74
[04:29:23] fragiles so we have a lot of [ __ ]
[04:29:26] resin honestly I should probably not
[04:29:28] spend any more resin and then cap like
[04:29:30] [ __ ] 600
[04:29:33] till Fontan but I don't really want to
[04:29:34] do that
[04:29:35] but it probably would be smart content
[04:29:38] wise to do that
[04:29:40] but yeah
[04:29:42] uh anyways
[04:29:47] that's that also I have a Abyss
[04:29:49] randomizer the this randomizer wheel
[04:29:52] spin from the last of which was really
[04:29:53] hard is done and fully edited I could
[04:29:55] upload it but there's like Parts I want
[04:29:57] to change and I can't watch it without
[04:29:58] cringing so it's hard for me to finish
[04:30:00] it
[04:30:01] because it's not bad it's just I can't
[04:30:03] watch myself
[04:30:05] I can't watch myself meow without
[04:30:07] cringing or watch myself so I don't know
[04:30:09] what I want to do with it but I'll
[04:30:10] probably upload it I just want it to be
[04:30:12] too late like if I upload it after font
[04:30:13] I thought it might be kind of irrelevant
[04:30:14] but we'll see
[04:30:16] um
[04:30:17] and then I might I wanna uh I might make
[04:30:20] a video on the Fontana base if it's
[04:30:21] weird and I will do uid reviews one is
[04:30:24] coming
[04:30:25] account reviews so stay tuned for those
[04:30:26] and then the normal stuff on stream and
[04:30:28] I [ __ ] love streaming so show you
[04:30:29] this as much as I can and we're gonna be
[04:30:31] exploring kokomi Island
[04:30:33] [ __ ] you Sans sorry so yeah expect all
[04:30:35] that
[04:30:36] uh and I do want to play my favorite
[04:30:38] Play account so we'll see I was debating
[04:30:40] if the freed up account actually does
[04:30:42] like if I can transform it it does well
[04:30:43] then I might do a challenge like I've
[04:30:46] always wanted to be like okay how far
[04:30:47] can I get in 24 hours or in a week or in
[04:30:50] a month or like but it's like hard like
[04:30:52] will I stream every day for a month
[04:30:54] always on another account I don't know
[04:30:56] so it's something that I might think of
[04:30:59] but yeah we'll see
[04:31:04] anyways I [ __ ] love you guys
[04:31:08] soon Fountain out very [ __ ] soon I'll
[04:31:11] try to do a stream before but if not no
[04:31:13] big deal I'll just be prepping videos so
[04:31:14] I can stream as soon as fontan's out
[04:31:17] um and I'll try not to be late on the
[04:31:19] guides because I don't know how fast I
[04:31:22] can get them out but especially because
[04:31:23] like Lenny for example like he's
[04:31:25] probably gonna need new flowers new
[04:31:26] Talent mats new boss like everything so
[04:31:29] it might take a little bit but I'll try
[04:31:31] to get it out as soon as possible thanks
[04:31:32] for watching the stream I love all of
[04:31:34] you not a parasocially [ __ ] you what it
[04:31:36] is doesn't be here uh before we leave
[04:31:37] we're gonna rate someone maybe I don't
[04:31:39] even know who's online
[04:31:41] um but we can and then I can see you all
[04:31:44] in the next one thanks for watching
[04:31:47] hmm we can read Club memos but he is
[04:31:50] French and that is a big butt like a
[04:31:52] pretty like like Eula I didn't say that
[04:31:54] I'm sorry respectfully that is a big
[04:31:57] butt though
[04:31:58] um he is French so be wary
[04:32:12] to survive hardship you must prepare for
[04:32:14] hardship

[04:32:40] online this late
[04:32:41] at least playing gunjan there's a lot
[04:32:43] but most of them are like other
[04:32:44] languages
