[00:34:43] it it's as easy as that he's just the
[00:34:45] I'm just the goat at listen in life
[00:34:48] sometimes you need to fail a little so
[00:34:50] you can succeed a lot look here's an
[00:34:52] example daily quote any decision I make
[00:34:54] during a mission Matra wait is that all
[00:34:57] ham or soo soo I don't know dude I don't
[00:35:00] [ __ ] I any decision I make during a
[00:35:04] mission can have a profound effect on
[00:35:07] the fates of
[00:35:08] others I forgot I forgot the word Matra
[00:35:11] which one it represented my bad for my
[00:35:13] position as a
[00:35:14] Matra the same way I respect knowledge
[00:35:17] and
[00:35:19] power
[00:35:23] any you know I haven't heard any of the
[00:35:27] I only heard English Soo never heard
[00:35:29] other but English is pretty all
[00:35:34] ability that looks like fire but I can't
[00:35:36] tell which one and I don't want to spend
[00:35:37] time so it looks like a projectile but
[00:35:40] just in case it isn't we're going to
[00:35:41] guess deluke okay never mind it's
[00:35:42] definitely a projectile I still don't
[00:35:44] know what the [ __ ] this is let me close
[00:35:45] chat what the [ __ ] is that what the [ __ ]
[00:35:48] is
[00:35:49] that uh I don't know it's kind of too
[00:35:51] early to tell
[00:35:53] oh oh [ __ ] wait I've seen this wait I
[00:35:56] know what this is this is a passive
[00:35:58] though it's not an ability so it's kind
[00:35:59] of harder wait wait wait wait wait wait
[00:36:01] wa wait wait let me screenshot
[00:36:04] it wait wait I know this let me cook let
[00:36:06] me
[00:36:15] cook okay that did not help I I feel
[00:36:18] like this is
[00:36:21] pyro I feel like this is pyro but I
[00:36:25] could also be an Nemo
[00:36:28] I don't know what this
[00:36:33] is okay I'm actually not sure
[00:36:36] uh who the [ __ ] is this have I seen this
[00:36:39] I feel like I've seen this I've
[00:36:41] definitely seen this actually but I
[00:36:42] don't know who it
[00:36:44] is dissolution Eon heavenfall s like
[00:36:47] something [ __ ] scar would say but I
[00:36:49] don't think his passives look like that
[00:36:51] dissolution Eon Heaven who the [ __ ] has
[00:36:54] an ability called dissolution eon
[00:36:58] who the [ __ ] would name an ability that
[00:37:00] I mean wander would but that looks
[00:37:04] pyro oh it is an
[00:37:07] emo can you imagine if this is chia no
[00:37:10] that's not
[00:37:18] Chia what if it is Shia okay let me make
[00:37:20] sure it's not CH listen chat if it's
[00:37:22] Chia I'm kill I'm if
[00:37:25] it's
[00:37:27] all right we have a few things to do uh
[00:37:29] before we start playing genin first
[00:37:31] thing there's new banners that came out
[00:37:33] I I just saw them there's uh uh Sino
[00:37:37] Banner Al ayato banner and uh haran and
[00:37:42] uh sinos weapon uh Scarlet Sands I
[00:37:44] believe it's called so we're going to
[00:37:45] review those listen for me about me not
[00:37:48] getting the Sha passive listen
[00:37:51] okay listen I look at Shia's eyes when I
[00:37:55] play him and I look at the ability bar
[00:37:57] he's in my party if he was benched I
[00:37:59] would know what the [ __ ] this passive
[00:38:00] looks like but since he's in my party
[00:38:02] I'm not looking at his [ __ ] passives
[00:38:04] God forbid I forget the [ __ ] what a
[00:38:07] passive looks like I'm sorry okay I
[00:38:09] actually don't know why I didn't know
[00:38:10] that I there's actually no excuse for
[00:38:12] that but it's okay okay it's fine listen
[00:38:15] I knew that it could be but I didn't
[00:38:16] want to admit it I didn't want to accept
[00:38:18] that I it could have been Tri and I
[00:38:19] didn't get it listen dude
[00:38:25] it's
[00:38:29] okay cuz it looks like fire like I know
[00:38:31] what is passives do if you ask me oh Z
[00:38:34] what does his a four pass do oh your
[00:38:36] skills are going to do more damage the
[00:38:38] more you cast in a in successionally
[00:38:41] successional but I know that but I
[00:38:43] didn't know the the passive icon looked
[00:38:45] like that once you Triple Crown you
[00:38:48] never look at abilities true see true
[00:38:51] this chatter gets it this chatter gets
[00:38:55] it
[00:39:03] anyways uh let's actually do a banner
[00:39:05] review this time I mean I oftentimes do
[00:39:07] a banner review but I don't normally do
[00:39:09] a banner review some what did I just say
[00:39:10] did I just say words I don't know Banner
[00:39:12] review ding ding ding ding ding all
[00:39:14] right so Soo ayato I might make a should
[00:39:19] you pull video for them I'm not sure yet
[00:39:21] but to start with the five stars let's
[00:39:23] start with the five stars
[00:39:25] okay so let me turn the music down all
[00:39:28] right
[00:39:30] Soo listen I know everyone's going to
[00:39:32] type benched I don't bench him I think
[00:39:34] sino's a pretty decent carry okay he's
[00:39:36] not he's not insane he's just pretty
[00:39:37] good okay the main drawback is you can't
[00:39:39] swap out of him he stays there for a
[00:39:41] while sometimes against multiple
[00:39:42] rotation enemies like like multiple
[00:39:44] waves of enemies it can be annoying but
[00:39:45] generally speaking if you're playing him
[00:39:46] in quick bloom or hyper Bloom I think
[00:39:48] he's very strong as a good decent on
[00:39:50] Fielder uh if you're just playing him
[00:39:52] aggravate kaching will usually just be
[00:39:53] better and then you're like well why am
[00:39:55] I playing Soo but for quick Blom I think
[00:39:57] he's pretty POG uh you could run him
[00:39:58] with finina you could run him without
[00:40:00] finina um but I think he's
[00:40:03] decent uh and he's fun on field I like
[00:40:06] running him with thundering Fury and you
[00:40:07] can spam your skill and if you like him
[00:40:09] cool Ayo extremely versatile Hydro um as
[00:40:14] a longtime Ayo fan rank one Ayo by the
[00:40:17] way no big deal uh I think he's really
[00:40:21] good because you can use them in
[00:40:22] basically any Hydro reaction as your on
[00:40:24] Fielder the only problem is they
[00:40:26] released net and uh listen I know Ayo
[00:40:30] has more off field presence uh you're
[00:40:33] going to be a good driver and I think IO
[00:40:36] so I think before nevet came out IO is
[00:40:38] like really if you're only going to get
[00:40:40] one Hydro character on field for your
[00:40:43] account IO would be in the
[00:40:45] discussion I still think he is but nlet
[00:40:49] is just broken like I think nevet is
[00:40:52] literally broken like like so broken as
[00:40:55] a DPS
[00:41:00] uh also okay this has nothing to do with
[00:41:02] this video people keep typing Jack ofall
[00:41:04] trades master of none to every support
[00:41:06] or every character that's versatile shut
[00:41:08] the [ __ ] up that's not how genin works
[00:41:11] okay a character that's used in 20 teams
[00:41:13] is more viable than a character who's
[00:41:15] only good in one team or at least more
[00:41:17] more flexible for your account and a
[00:41:19] better pull okay just because just
[00:41:21] because child Shang Ling is better with
[00:41:23] child Shang Ling and then you would want
[00:41:24] child for your Shang Ling team for K
[00:41:26] changling doesn't mean he's better for
[00:41:27] your overall account than like a nevet
[00:41:29] for 86 teams or aor or kakomi for 26
[00:41:33] others maybe if you want to play Shang
[00:41:34] Ling child is a really strong meta
[00:41:36] option and I think child is great for
[00:41:38] that right but a lot of hydros are very
[00:41:41] very versatile that doesn't mean they're
[00:41:43] bad in their teams anyways let's not get
[00:41:45] into that I think IO is a good Hydro
[00:41:47] option but
[00:41:50] um if you're like he's good in a lot of
[00:41:53] teams and especially with dendro uh I
[00:41:56] think Ito is just really nice with the
[00:41:59] release of nevet I am more leaning
[00:42:01] towards recommending nevet as your hydro
[00:42:03] five star if you're only going to pull
[00:42:04] for one on Fielder
[00:42:07] um yolan in my opinion is higher value
[00:42:10] but yolan is different because she's off
[00:42:11] field like it's not the same role as IO
[00:42:13] but
[00:42:15] anyways yeah so that's my point I think
[00:42:17] now with with nevet I would just yeah
[00:42:19] but I mean I for the four stars though
[00:42:22] like for for main DPS characters are on
[00:42:23] fields it's like pull if you like them
[00:42:25] like if you like son you want to play
[00:42:26] get him he's good enough if you like AO
[00:42:27] he's very flexible has a lot of honestly
[00:42:29] good teams okay now for the four stars
[00:42:32] Shang Ling Oh wrong wrong
[00:42:35] soundboard Shang Le uh if you don't have
[00:42:38] her C4 shangle conations are great to
[00:42:40] get the C4 but she's been out since 1.0
[00:42:43] so if You' played this game a little you
[00:42:44] probably have Shang link constellations
[00:42:46] cuz she's been on like 20 banners um so
[00:42:48] yeah I mean nice but you probably have
[00:42:50] her cons Kookie and Kirara though tasty
[00:42:55] Kirara is especially uh well okay kie
[00:42:58] great but Kirara is like a newer
[00:42:59] character so less people have cons of
[00:43:00] her and she actually has so first of all
[00:43:03] Kirara let's talk about her good dentro
[00:43:06] shielder and the reason we have to talk
[00:43:08] about constellations on Benders is cuz
[00:43:10] it it m like you're going to be if
[00:43:11] you're pulling for the five star you
[00:43:12] might get constellations of certain four
[00:43:13] stars it's not just about the base
[00:43:15] character like Shang ling you're going
[00:43:16] to have her for free but her cons are
[00:43:18] good Kirara just getting one since she's
[00:43:20] a pretty new character you might not
[00:43:22] have her already is a good thing Kirara
[00:43:24] a pretty strong option kind of similar
[00:43:25] to ya but instead of healing you Shields
[00:43:27] you which makes her worse with like
[00:43:28] finina and stuff but I can't find her in
[00:43:30] my team by the way but uh in general
[00:43:32] where is
[00:43:35] Kora there she is she's pretty good very
[00:43:37] very strong Shield uh can be the
[00:43:40] strongest fourstar shield I know it like
[00:43:41] kind of depends on stuff but generally
[00:43:43] just a really strong shield and her cons
[00:43:45] are actually good um not all of them but
[00:43:49] C3 gives you Shield like a stronger
[00:43:51] Shield cuz Talent levels C4 gives you a
[00:43:53] bit of dendro from off field because
[00:43:55] it'll fire coordinated Dent attacks and
[00:43:58] not like the fastest but it's only once
[00:44:00] every like almost 4 seconds but you know
[00:44:02] and then C6 this one is nice and tasty
[00:44:04] you get more Elemental damage bonus for
[00:44:06] your party members which is good that's
[00:44:08] good so uh overall really strong forar
[00:44:12] shielder I like Kirara and pretty good
[00:44:15] constellations is she a good dendra
[00:44:17] applier not really but constellations
[00:44:19] help even C1 can give her more pedals
[00:44:21] from her uh burst uh but outside of that
[00:44:25] it it it C4 helps with
[00:44:28] it
[00:44:30] Kookie is great I love Kookie I think
[00:44:33] Kookie is amazing forar uh if you don't
[00:44:35] have her getting one is sick and then if
[00:44:37] you do have her her C2 gives her 100% up
[00:44:39] time which is uh really good
[00:44:40] constellation and then the other cons
[00:44:42] are mostly whatever
[00:44:44] but uh well see1 helps with AOE but
[00:44:46] especially
[00:44:48] C6 while this is mostly looks like a
[00:44:51] skill issue thing it's if you you know
[00:44:53] are about to die you don't die and you
[00:44:54] save up 1 HP with hyper Bloom and you
[00:44:56] sometimes you can damage yourself with
[00:44:57] your own Bloom sometimes you can be
[00:44:58] squishy KY likes to stay low HP this can
[00:45:01] actually help save you right it saves
[00:45:03] you at 1 HP and you'll gain some
[00:45:05] Elemental Mastery which can be optimal
[00:45:06] because she wants em uh so cookie conss
[00:45:09] are pretty good especially C2 so good
[00:45:11] four stars overall if you want the five
[00:45:13] stars lastly the weapon matter now
[00:45:18] listen I have mixed feelings about this
[00:45:21] weapon matter these four stars are are
[00:45:23] are delectable if I could eat these four
[00:45:25] stars for I
[00:45:27] would um lion's roar has been on like
[00:45:30] every Banner so it's kind of whatever
[00:45:31] and it's just like a it's a decent
[00:45:33] statistic it's whatever whith I love as
[00:45:35] a four star uh it requires you to like
[00:45:37] know what you're doing and play around
[00:45:38] it and sometimes you can swap in get the
[00:45:39] wrong music note or swap in and not get
[00:45:41] a music note or mess up your timing but
[00:45:43] it can help for like frontload of damage
[00:45:45] CU you're buff for 10 seconds out of 30
[00:45:47] you can like cheese some content by
[00:45:48] resetting till you get the good buff
[00:45:50] whatever but then it also comes with
[00:45:52] three five weapons five Lance which is
[00:45:54] great on like any spear support support
[00:45:56] po arm support fav bow great on like
[00:45:58] every bow support and then fav Claymore
[00:46:02] no one cares about cuz Claymore is
[00:46:04] Claymores but uh you know Dory or
[00:46:08] saou but it's not bad it's still a FB
[00:46:10] Weapon It's just Claymore supports are
[00:46:12] kind of not all that right
[00:46:15] now
[00:46:18] um Noel yeah but who's giving Noel fav I
[00:46:22] mean I if that hey you do you man hey
[00:46:25] anyways then the five star weapons this
[00:46:27] is what
[00:46:28] matters
[00:46:30] um why is soo okay yeah let's not look
[00:46:33] at that we got Haron and the paddle the
[00:46:36] paddle is actually not bad because it
[00:46:38] gives you like 44 crit rate and some
[00:46:40] Elemental Mastery so while this is
[00:46:43] mostly a weapon for Soo right you want
[00:46:45] this for your Soo um it's actually not
[00:46:48] bad on other characters that can use the
[00:46:49] EM so example like Hut this can be good
[00:46:51] on Shang
[00:46:52] Ling can actually be good a lot of crit
[00:46:55] rate here the the base stack is a bit
[00:46:56] low but a ton of crit rate and then um
[00:46:58] sorry I said it gives you em but that's
[00:47:01] it scales on your em so if you're
[00:47:02] building em it will convert that into
[00:47:04] attack that is what I meant to say um so
[00:47:06] you know it could be good for those
[00:47:07] characters it could also good for
[00:47:08] Rosaria and reverse melt because she can
[00:47:10] reverse melt if she's building em uh is
[00:47:13] there someone else I'm missing I don't
[00:47:15] know it's just a stat stick crit rate
[00:47:17] convert em to attack pretty
[00:47:20] decent
[00:47:21] um yes mostly for Soo but it's it's not
[00:47:24] a bad fivar hold on if you get it
[00:47:29] Haron
[00:47:31] Haron haran's right um
[00:47:35] haran's Haron looks good and it has a
[00:47:38] funny name it's it's it's it's just a
[00:47:42] stat stick it's okay the reason I'm
[00:47:44] laughing about it is cuz it's not bad
[00:47:46] but it's if you're going to pull for one
[00:47:48] five star sword for all of your
[00:47:49] characters it's usually going to be
[00:47:52] either Jade cutter or Miss spitter uh
[00:47:55] usually Jade cutter and MPL are the more
[00:47:57] like especially Jade cutter is like okay
[00:48:00] this like five characters want this as
[00:48:01] their best in slot type of thing Haron
[00:48:04] is usually a bit worse because of how
[00:48:06] its effect works which I'm going to pull
[00:48:07] up right now um because of the
[00:48:09] conditions needed dude I searched up
[00:48:12] Haron is genjin impact
[00:48:17] Haram okay what the
[00:48:24] [ __ ]
[00:48:29] uh let me pull up the trigger conditions
[00:48:30] of it's passive I don't have them all
[00:48:31] memorized I think have like normal
[00:48:33] attack and this and then that like skill
[00:48:35] what is it oh no it's just skill right
[00:48:37] because for Io Miss spit is uh normal
[00:48:40] right let's read it 12% on damage bonus
[00:48:46] uh yeah one stack per uh nearby party
[00:48:49] member skill Max Two
[00:48:51] Stacks yeah okay
[00:48:54] yeah yeah yeah it's just yeah I mean
[00:48:58] okay for every sword user you use you're
[00:49:00] getting 33 crit rate with 608 base
[00:49:03] attack which is like
[00:49:05] standard but you also get 12% Elemental
[00:49:07] damage bonus so it'll stop there for a
[00:49:09] lot of characters for a lot of
[00:49:10] characters you get a decent amount of
[00:49:12] stats and 12% Elemental damage bonus
[00:49:14] which is okay now if you can use normal
[00:49:17] attacks if your sword character is an
[00:49:18] onfield auto attacker which honestly not
[00:49:20] that many sword characters are but Ayo
[00:49:22] is alham kind of is although it's mostly
[00:49:25] his that do damage but still you will
[00:49:27] get 20% normal attack damage from its
[00:49:29] passive which is decent great for Ayo
[00:49:32] okay for like kaching Al height them
[00:49:34] whatever but in general it's just a stat
[00:49:36] stick for base stack crit rate and then
[00:49:38] Elemental damage
[00:49:39] bonus it's just the thing is like if
[00:49:42] you're just going for stats for a lot of
[00:49:44] characters Jade cutter Miss
[00:49:46] spitter even Loi can just be better uh
[00:49:50] well Loi depends but yeah um so I don't
[00:49:53] like it as like you're I'm only going to
[00:49:56] pull for one five star weapon or one
[00:49:58] five star sword for my account I would
[00:50:00] prefer another one but it's decent what
[00:50:03] about AA yeah but AA doesn't like normal
[00:50:06] attack spam she'll do like Dash like
[00:50:08] whatever EQ whatever then Dash normal
[00:50:10] charge attack and then normal charge
[00:50:12] attack normal or just charge like she's
[00:50:13] not like normal
[00:50:18] spamming or like N2 or N I don't know
[00:50:20] what the [ __ ] stamina efficient combo
[00:50:22] is but I I quick swap my IA a lot I
[00:50:24] don't St my IA when I burst on AA I swap
[00:50:26] the sheno to press e again then I go
[00:50:28] back to AA I do like two charge attacks
[00:50:30] maybe three and then I swap out but like
[00:50:33] they're both decent this I don't know
[00:50:35] four stars are good the five stars are
[00:50:36] kind of whatever but they're like
[00:50:38] they're good how do I explain how do I
[00:50:40] explain these five star weapons these
[00:50:42] five star weapons are
[00:50:44] like both pretty decent stat sticks but
[00:50:47] they're almost never best in slot except
[00:50:49] on the characters they're designed for
[00:50:50] and you might be like well okay aren't
[00:50:52] weapons only best on the characters
[00:50:54] they're designed for no cuz a lot of
[00:50:56] [ __ ] a lot of like like Jade cutter
[00:50:58] or like polar star or like Aqua
[00:50:59] simulakra are good on like every
[00:51:02] character as like basically their best
[00:51:03] option whereas these two swords are like
[00:51:05] or this sword and this pole arm are like
[00:51:07] decent like they're like real they're
[00:51:08] high up on the weapon ranking cuz
[00:51:10] they're good stat sticks but they're
[00:51:11] never like the best option except for
[00:51:13] one character maybe two so it's like
[00:51:16] kind of it's niche but even outside of
[00:51:17] their Niche they're
[00:51:19] good what about Haron for Lila on field
[00:51:22] true that's that's good anyways four
[00:51:25] stars are good and four stars are good
[00:51:27] here so if you like any of the five
[00:51:28] stars get it but the all the four stars
[00:51:31] on these Banners are great um so I mean
[00:51:34] you know it is what it
[00:51:37] is cool it okay sorry that wasn't
[00:51:48] [Applause]
[00:51:54] bad
[00:52:07] [Applause]
[00:52:11] there anything else I should add chat
[00:52:12] did I forget something uh the thing is
[00:52:15] like I don't know I like these four star
[00:52:18] a lot the characters are just like if
[00:52:20] you like them they're kind of just
[00:52:21] mediocre well in a good way like they're
[00:52:23] good they're like upper they're like ER
[00:52:26] I I'm so angry about these weapons cuz
[00:52:28] they're like not bad but they're not and
[00:52:30] they're not mid they're just not amazing
[00:52:32] they're just
[00:52:37] good they're good they're just not like
[00:52:40] oh no way bro they're upper
[00:52:44] middle that's mid no cuz Okay a mid five
[00:52:48] star is
[00:52:49] like it's like mid plus exactly it's
[00:52:52] like there's a plus after it Fab true
[00:52:56] it is a very nice Fab Banner it's upper
[00:53:01] mid mid is unforged exactly it's like
[00:53:05] EXA hey true it's like unforged is here
[00:53:08] and then like like what's like an
[00:53:10] amazing weapon like Aqua simula is here
[00:53:12] or like Polar Star is here I'm saying
[00:53:13] Polar Star not Aqua because I don't want
[00:53:15] people to think they need Aqua for their
[00:53:16] yolan when El or fav can sometimes be
[00:53:18] better anyways so uh uh uh uh like like
[00:53:20] like like unforg is here and then and
[00:53:22] then and then and then and then and then
[00:53:24] uh uh uh uh Polar Star is here and then
[00:53:26] these weapons are like in the middle of
[00:53:28] the
[00:53:29] two an hour of stalling okay let's end
[00:53:32] it
[00:53:33] there it's okay pull at your own risk

[00:58:49] pretty similar they're pretty similar
[00:58:50] what I do is so the thing I do with
[00:58:52] Twitter is I tweet and then I log off
[00:58:54] cuz I I think I'm funny that's it
[00:58:56] sometimes I'll interact with people but
[00:58:57] I try not to so if the more I scroll it
[00:58:59] the more my brain rots and I've noticed
[00:59:01] that my day and the qu my quality of
[00:59:04] life gets worse the longer I stay on the
[00:59:06] app so I usually just launch it and then
[00:59:08] close it that's normally what I
[00:59:11] do um so I assume it's the
[00:59:18] same I assume it's the same uh I just
[00:59:21] know that some ticktockers have a lot of
[00:59:25] a younger audience than I do and a lot
[00:59:28] of a
[00:59:30] more um how do I say this nicely a lot
[00:59:34] of a
[00:59:36] more
[00:59:37] um Mal not malleable what's the
[00:59:41] word
[00:59:43] influenceable
[00:59:45] audience
[00:59:47] um I mean mine is
[00:59:51] too impressionable that's the word
[00:59:57] listen what do you mean we're five okay
[01:00:00] you literally can't type that on Twitch
[01:00:02] or you get banned you have to be 13 plus
[01:00:04] for twitch but also we try to be we try
[01:00:07] to be listen I try not to be [ __ ]
[01:00:10] Coco melon okay I try not to have that
[01:00:14] be my
[01:00:15] audience like I try to to cater I try to
[01:00:19] I try to I try to make sure that I'm
[01:00:22] allowed to slander a character I feel
[01:00:23] like okay I I feel like I feel like I've
[01:00:26] seen people I have seen people get mad
[01:00:28] at creators for like talking bad about a
[01:00:31] character they like because it's like
[01:00:33] their their comfortable character I want
[01:00:35] to be able to start my stream and be
[01:00:36] like you know what CLE [ __ ] sucks I
[01:00:38] hope dodoo explodes and she dies I want
[01:00:41] to be able to say that listen nothing
[01:00:42] wrong with CLE no disrespect to Cle
[01:00:45] players I just want to be able to say
[01:00:47] that I'm not saying I'm going to say it
[01:00:49] I'm just saying I want to be able to I
[01:00:51] don't want listen I just want you guys
[01:00:53] to know that I can I want to be able to
[01:00:56] say that without necessarily saying it
[01:00:58] okay if a new character comes out let's
[01:01:01] say completely fictional character okay
[01:01:03] completely fictional let's say they
[01:01:05] release a beautiful designed character
[01:01:07] that everyone's sing over okay their
[01:01:08] Elemental skill is a field that doesn't
[01:01:10] really do much and their burst lasts
[01:01:12] like 4 seconds and if you jump you
[01:01:13] cancel it and it doesn't work with Hydro
[01:01:15] appliers like soran okay let's say that
[01:01:17] happens and I'm like you know what this
[01:01:19] character kind of sucks I don't I want
[01:01:21] to be able to say that without people
[01:01:22] being like oh you suck
[01:01:25] does that make sense okay that's the
[01:01:26] only difference that's the only
[01:01:30] difference
[01:01:32] anyways no there's no character like
[01:01:34] that there's no character like that also
[01:01:37] I just thought of this idea myself okay
[01:01:39] what if future pyro characters had
[01:01:42] different color fire I didn't actually
[01:01:44] think of this idea myself Jake Jake had
[01:01:46] this idea when we were chilling and I
[01:01:47] was like okay I'm Ying this so now it's
[01:01:49] my idea what if AR Lino's fire was blue
[01:01:52] what if like her sword was just or or
[01:01:54] how do we know spear shut up whatever
[01:01:57] whatever listen what if whatever weapon
[01:01:59] she uses had whatever sword was blue
[01:02:05] fire think about it how do you know suck
[01:02:08] my
[01:02:11] balls think about it what if what if
[01:02:13] they released duuke what if duuke was
[01:02:17] like green no green is ugly well green
[01:02:20] green dark and green like Shia is cool
[01:02:22] but if it's like bright green fire
[01:02:23] that's kind of ugly I don't know what if
[01:02:25] dude what if fire yeah like black fire
[01:02:28] no blue fire is the coolest I can't
[01:02:31] lie W ho fire oh that's actually not
[01:02:35] bad wait can I can I show
[01:02:39] hoo yeah like this oh the [ __ ] got an
[01:02:42] ad over it but like
[01:02:46] that anyways I think different colored
[01:02:48] fires would be cool that's all that was
[01:02:51] the only point I had blue Pyon shut shut
[01:02:54] the [ __ ] up it's not about Shang
[01:03:00] Ling I don't know why but I feel like
[01:03:02] zock streams are basically that time in
[01:03:05] class when the teacher lefts for some
[01:03:08] minutes and the class go fire I don't
[01:03:12] know okay that that is not true that I

[01:14:51] resin they also put a l there this is
[01:14:53] just for me this isn't for everyone
[01:14:54] obviously but for just for me uh we have
[01:14:56] 1,700 resin that's why the lament is
[01:14:58] there it's personalized and that's why
[01:15:00] we have so much resin obviously dude why
[01:15:02] it's literally impossible to get this
[01:15:03] much resin naturally so you guys can
[01:15:06] tell that I obviously got it from an
[01:15:08] external source and I'm not one to say
[01:15:10] no to a gift because I'm doing it for
[01:15:12] you guys so that's the plan of today's
[01:15:14] stream we have 1,700 resin to spend but
[01:15:16] first we're going to do ayss I need to
[01:15:17] do like four to five clears because I

[01:40:02] why was that damage so low did I did my
[01:40:04] e expire or was it not not Vaped or
[01:40:06] something might not have been Vaped cuz
[01:40:08] normally I burst are higher I
[01:40:11] think whatever that's
[01:40:19] fine
[01:40:25] I'm not adding very
[01:40:28] finina what even is that ha I think you

[01:40:44] cie how much ER would I need for my aam
[01:40:47] I [ __ ] test
[01:40:49] it uh probably like like 140 but it
[01:40:53] depends cuz I don't know if you're BYU
[01:40:55] eting once or twice I usually do it
[01:40:58] twice wait can you do it twice cuz I'll
[01:41:01] on yeah you can do it at the start and

[01:41:27] normal with the so you might need a
[01:41:28] little bit higher but uh your Buu is
[01:41:31] going to need more in that team although

[03:35:56] proxy boss enough chatter let's
[03:36:05] go dude
[03:36:09] what
[03:36:20] and Hollow Raiders are W yeah Nicole
[03:36:23] stays on the
[03:36:24] team ass no way you said that all conly
[03:36:28] mning each other in the name of
[03:36:34] greed what to protect your secret
[03:36:36] identity
[03:36:38] unfortunately the ones being res you
[03:36:40] don't seem to plan on returning the
[03:36:43] favor enough I get it I'll give you the
[03:36:48] code huh
[03:36:52] wait I can still give you the code still
[03:36:56] trying to bargain with
[03:36:58] me don't panic the password we can get
[03:37:01] the password if you give us back system
[03:37:03] control true no way proxies Hollow
[03:37:07] Raiders none of you can be trusted
[03:37:09] including faith
[03:37:11] H wait there's a backup on the proxy
[03:37:15] Network hand over your intern account
[03:37:17] I'll retrieve the strong box P hey
[03:37:20] answer me I almost forgot the proxy
[03:37:24] network is the foundation of a proxy's
[03:37:25] business losing the account is losing
[03:37:28] any proof fa never existed but to save
[03:37:31] those in the hollow you'll have to think
[03:37:33] quickly give you the proxy network
[03:37:35] account then what you ruined our system
[03:37:38] I promise I'll save them
[03:37:41] hell's there okay I'll give but if you
[03:37:43] go back on your word I'll make you pay
[03:37:46] [ __ ] is
[03:37:48] happening confidential data transfer
[03:37:52] complete even the source authentication
[03:37:54] code page was
[03:37:56] transferred we'd like to ask a question
[03:37:58] since you're cooperating I'm in a good
[03:38:00] mood ask me what's in the strong box
[03:38:03] that's so important Vermilion there's
[03:38:04] actually artifacts that are really good
[03:38:05] for certain characters like Vermilion
[03:38:07] that could be used on almost anyone
[03:38:08] initially it was just for Shia but with
[03:38:10] the relase of finina and eventually D
[03:38:11] Leaf you can actually damage all of your
[03:38:12] party member which means that Vermilion
[03:38:14] four piece can actually be used on
[03:38:15] anyone it's actually a pretty good set
[03:38:17] which is why I personally like
[03:38:18] Vermillion and I'm sure that silver wolf
[03:38:20] over here is trying to get Vermillion
[03:38:22] for strong boxing sets like Vermilion or
[03:38:24] emblem but primarily Vermillion
[03:38:26] something someone like you will never
[03:38:28] get your hands on as you know the
[03:38:29] hollows are changing all the time the
[03:38:31] carrots used to get out function by
[03:38:33] calculating a huge amount of hollow data
[03:38:36] however Hollow observation equipment
[03:38:38] accumulates errors to sure data remains
[03:38:41] valid it must be recalibrated using the
[03:38:43] hollow Master data every few days the
[03:38:45] single copy of Rosetta data that's in
[03:38:49] the hands inside the strong box is
[03:38:51] something comparable to that Rosetta
[03:38:53] data okay I see for proxies and Hollow
[03:38:57] okay have you activated your yes with
[03:39:00] that said we have one final question who
[03:39:03] now don't misunderstand my question is
[03:39:06] since you're such a master hacker why
[03:39:09] not just steal the pass from our system
[03:39:11] after learning the password is backed up
[03:39:13] on the proxy Network what I'm warning
[03:39:16] you don't make me now that I think about
[03:39:19] it other than taking control of my
[03:39:21] system you haven't else a hacker would
[03:39:24] instead you just blackmailed us with
[03:39:26] Nicole and the
[03:39:28] other keep mocking the hacker well it
[03:39:31] looks like that's the best you've got
[03:39:33] shut up just tell me where the backup is
[03:39:36] don't worry mystery hacker listen
[03:39:38] carefully can you hear
[03:39:40] what what did you do we're just
[03:39:43] fulfilling our duty as as the election

[03:39:52] precise he I get it so that's it it was
[03:39:56] planned you even abandoned your identity
[03:39:59] as Faith under trick me no you're wrong
