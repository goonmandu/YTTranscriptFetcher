[00:12:27] lot to do I saw this uh
[00:12:33] this uh okay not the not the be the not
[00:12:37] to put myself in a situation but I saw I
[00:12:41] I thought this thing was funny I saw dis
[00:12:43] but caught when someone was like does
[00:12:45] she play honai and then I was thinking I
[00:12:47] was like I was thinking to myself I was
[00:12:48] like dude I don't really play honai like
[00:12:50] I played it for a bit I downloaded I
[00:12:51] actually had the game on my phone for
[00:12:52] like a while I still have it on my phone
[00:12:54] but like I played it for a bit but I was
[00:12:56] like eh right uh like I didn't get that
[00:12:58] far however first of all C Mode's funny
[00:13:01] uh however I was thinking about this I
[00:13:02] was
[00:13:05] like I don't play the game but I'm like
[00:13:08] working on on on on buying every piece
[00:13:12] of mobus merch that I can find uh to
[00:13:14] build up a not a shrine but like a a a
[00:13:18] territory in my house where it's just
[00:13:19] mobus right there's going to be Shia
[00:13:21] there's going to be Mobius maybe maybe
[00:13:23] you know we'll see uh so I don't know
[00:13:25] what that makes me um
[00:13:29] cuz I don't like actively play the game
[00:13:31] but uh caught I
[00:13:34] guess speaking of thinking dude I was
[00:13:36] taking a shower and there's like no more
[00:13:38] like shampoo well no more conditioner
[00:13:40] but we're going to use shampoo for the
[00:13:41] sake of the story there's no more
[00:13:42] shampoo uh and so I was like okay well
[00:13:44] I'll just you know the thing you do okay
[00:13:46] you know the thing you do when you have
[00:13:47] no shampoo and you like fill it with
[00:13:48] water and then you have to like like you
[00:13:49] try to like you take the lid off you try
[00:13:51] to like put water in it and you try to
[00:13:52] like [ __ ] do that so that the last
[00:13:54] bits of shampoo go go on your [ __ ]
[00:13:56] hand so you can use it so that it's not
[00:13:57] you're not out and I did that and I was
[00:13:59] like okay I got some finally and then I
[00:14:02] was like wait a second nope I'm muting
[00:14:03] that alert I was like wait a second this
[00:14:06] is exactly what it must feel like to
[00:14:08] play farzon without
[00:14:09] C6 is that not the Perfect Analogy cuz
[00:14:13] farizon C6 is like a full shampoo bottle
[00:14:15] you're chilling you can wash your hair
[00:14:17] you're good but czo farizon it works
[00:14:20] it'll wash your hair yeah you'll give
[00:14:22] anemo damage bonus you'll shred
[00:14:24] resistance sure but it's like you have
[00:14:26] to like fill it up with water you have
[00:14:27] to like remove the lid you have to like
[00:14:28] [ __ ] can shake that [ __ ] out for the
[00:14:30] last drop of
[00:14:32] shampoo true or not
[00:14:37] true cuz I would say true anyways so
[00:14:41] that's the state of my life right
[00:14:43] now solution don't shower yeah but
[00:14:45] you're not checking your shampoo levels
[00:14:47] before you shower you're mid shower
[00:14:49] you're naked fully wet what do you do
[00:14:51] you're going to you're going to use
[00:14:52] shampoo you're not going to be like oh
[00:14:53] guess I'm not showering today it's too
[00:14:54] late so I have to [ __ ] Chuck the lid
[00:14:57] off I was like there
[00:15:00] is I'm out of shampoo dude Z buy

[00:29:07] genin I'm on my free Play account
[00:29:08] because we're going to play on my main
[00:29:10] but I want to get the free yo yo before
[00:29:11] Lantern right leaves off stream dude off
[00:29:14] stream I did the like the first Quest
[00:29:16] and I got I did the yugu guoba puzzle uh
[00:29:20] those are easy uh this one time I was
[00:29:22] talking to this NPC the one that's like
[00:29:24] talking about gaming or two gaming or
[00:29:25] something I literally left on autoplay
[00:29:28] for like 15 minutes I came back it was
[00:29:32] still talking and there was no like
[00:29:33] option so it was like it was literally
[00:29:35] just yapping for like 15 minutes but
[00:29:38] anyways um all good all good um all good
[00:29:44] now you can be like z uh shouldn't you
[00:29:46] pay attention Okay but it's my second
[00:29:48] account so why do I have to endure it
[00:29:51] twice maybe because I'm twice a man uh
[00:29:54] uh than the average genin player true
[00:29:57] true true uh but ideally I wouldn't have
[00:29:59] to but all good
[00:30:03] um
[00:30:05] it's wait why are you telling me what
[00:30:07] type of mask she was
[00:30:09] wearing I it's it's the reminescent
[00:30:12] circlet are you have you not farmed the
[00:30:15] domain it's okay if you haven't it's a
[00:30:17] pretty efficient domain though uh you
[00:30:18] can strongbox emblem now but the emblem
[00:30:20] domain is still pretty good uh it's a
[00:30:21] reminescent ciret I would know like I
[00:30:23] would know I don't know what set you're
[00:30:24] talking about I don't think that one's
[00:30:25] out yet uh um but yeah remance is pretty
[00:30:29] good uh I don't cover leaks so if you're
[00:30:31] talking about a new set I wouldn't know
[00:30:33] um but anyways Vermilion mask is pretty
[00:30:35] cool too uh concerning that this account
[00:30:38] does have Vermillion uh that is a little
[00:30:40] bit concerning given the fact that it is
[00:30:43] ar47 uh that is a little bit concerning

[00:43:10] you're weird oh yeah no cuz it's no no

[00:51:15] deserve to make money for your work and
[00:51:17] labor I would just turn monetization on
[00:51:19] don't run a bunch of ads in the middle
[00:51:21] of the video but there'll be like a
[00:51:22] pre-roll one it's fine or like whatever
[00:51:23] is Auto and then people can just use ad
[00:51:25] blocker I know ad blockers suck or
[00:51:27] something doesn't work or on mobile it's
[00:51:28] annoying but like I would rather you not

[00:51:47] money I think most streamers should I
[00:51:50] don't but on YouTube videos it's like I
[00:51:53] feel like if you're putting a bunch of
[00:51:55] time in something you don't want to make
[00:51:56] zero off it like it just feels like
[00:51:58] you're wasting your life well not you
[00:51:59] but like I feel like I'm wasting like if
[00:52:01] I make a guide and like if I don't know
[00:52:04] I feel like I don't know it like tilts
[00:52:06] me if I
[00:52:08] like put a [ __ ] ton of my life into
[00:52:10] something and then it's just like it
[00:52:11] feels like I wasted all my time

[01:32:39] useless useless all right uh we should
[01:32:41] be
[01:32:45] good uh we could do I mean we could do a
[01:32:48] mar Run for the boys I don't know if I
[01:32:50] even need it uh
[01:32:53] um dude imagine we full clear floor 12
[01:32:55] with a map that looks like this even my
[01:32:57] inauma is just
[01:33:04] emblem dude you can't write hot take and
[01:33:07] then write the like objectively correct
[01:33:09] and accepted take that it's true but
[01:33:11] that's not a hot take getch it is like
[01:33:14] the most casual of casual
[01:33:20] games it's all good though like it's so
[01:33:24] I thought I actually talked about this
[01:33:25] with the Jeff last night and Fang uh uh
[01:33:28] literally don't literally the most the
[01:33:31] most hardcore okay casual I cuz I was
[01:33:35] thinking of like MMO elements if they
[01:33:37] would fit in genjin like some of them
[01:33:39] and the most casual MMO player is
[01:33:44] like the most hardcore genin player like
[01:33:47] that's where the overlap is it's like
[01:33:50] well not necessarily but like
[01:33:52] like there's a lot of casual like MMO
[01:33:54] players there's a lot but like even like
[01:33:57] casual MMO players would be hardcore G
[01:33:59] players like that's
[01:34:01] how much of the player base is just
[01:34:03] really casual which is fine but it's
[01:34:06] also why we're not going to get a lot of
[01:34:07] the content that I think would be cool
[01:34:09] but it's okay CRA this 30
[01:34:12] months has never played a day of ff14 in
[01:34:15] his life I I have like 10 okay for
[01:34:19] reference I spent maybe 10 years of my
[01:34:22] life playing old school RuneScape I have
[01:34:25] uh I was in the like like the weird
[01:34:27] elitist uh uh uh pvm Clan I had a cape
[01:34:31] that was worth $500 I had 10 of them
[01:34:33] because that's what I did for fun and I
[01:34:36] it's like that in like every MMO I have
[01:34:37] 800 lost ARC hours in like a month cuz I
[01:34:40] had no life I like MMOs and I'm pretty
[01:34:43] sweaty but it's like that doesn't
[01:34:46] translate the genjin it's completely
[01:34:48] different you farmed infernal caves yeah
[01:34:50] but I didn't sell them but like like
[01:34:52] they're
[01:34:56] fun 800 doesn't fit in a month whatever
[01:34:59] however long you guys know how long the
[01:35:01] Lost Arc hype for was it wasn't that
[01:35:02] long may it was two months three I don't
[01:35:04] know but however many I have 800 hours
[01:35:05] on
[01:35:08] Steam
[01:35:11] anyways so a lot of like raids and stuff
[01:35:13] I enjoy like that's all I did like if
[01:35:15] you look at like my RuneScape account it
[01:35:16] was like a ton of raid case like kill
[01:35:18] count and then it's like my stats were
[01:35:20] like sh well they're like okay they're
[01:35:22] like [ __ ] like everything else like I'm
[01:35:23] not cutting trees I'm not [ __ ]
[01:35:25] picking mint I'm sorry I'm not [ __ ]
[01:35:27] Mining Ores I'm just killing [ __ ] that's
[01:35:29] what I do it's like that's just what I
[01:35:31] did light it up your healing guide is
[01:35:34] trash bro that was 2 years ago is it is
[01:35:37] it it I don't know healing guide Zio
[01:35:41] what what even is who's this is a
[01:35:43] 2-year-old video hey what's up guys
[01:35:45] maybe now it's outdated I'm sure it was
[01:35:47] good at the time today we're going to
[01:35:49] talk about healers and how to play them
[01:35:50] efficiently the reason I have to do this
[01:35:52] is because the new Abyss wait this is I
[01:35:54] actually remember this is like perfectly
[01:35:55] I remember what I said here it's
[01:35:57] entirely true up until finina comes out
[01:35:59] the only time you ever care about how
[01:36:01] much you're healing and genin is with
[01:36:02] finina that's it that's it any other
[01:36:05] time it wasn't wait what did I say will
[01:36:07] provide your team with a significant
[01:36:09] amount of more damage or attack percent
[01:36:11] in this case don't go blast I mean don't
[01:36:13] go maidens set right now it is the most
[01:36:15] healing you can get because it gives you
[01:36:17] 15% healing Effectiveness and then when
[01:36:19] you use your skill or your burst all
[01:36:21] your party members will receive attack
[01:36:23] sand for healing and on a four piece
[01:36:25] rcent ventor which will give you a lot
[01:36:26] less healing than maidens can still heal
[01:36:29] more than enough for the floor 11 to
[01:36:32] okay that's true Jean go ver don't go
[01:36:34] another set Bennett if you go anything
[01:36:36] other than a blast or like instructor
[01:36:38] cool down what was I saying about the
[01:36:39] weapon if you have it or just any weapon
[01:36:41] that has a high base attack and or
[01:36:43] energy recharge honestly energy recharge
[01:36:45] is also super important for Bennett
[01:36:47] usually what you try to do is give him
[01:36:49] enough energy recharge to spam his burst
[01:36:50] on cool down with a high based stack
[01:36:52] weapon that means that weapons that have
[01:36:53] energy there literally nothing here is
[01:36:55] wrong Dona diona four piece no bless
[01:36:57] oblig with either energy recharge or
[01:36:59] yeah I think that's the time I didn't
[01:37:00] know about instructor I guess maybe
[01:37:01] that's the one thing what are you
[01:37:02] yapping about are you like a Noel man
[01:37:04] cuz I didn't mention Noel I remember
[01:37:05] someone was I remember people were mad
[01:37:06] at me when I release this video cuz I
[01:37:08] didn't mention Noel as a Healer if you
[01:37:09] play Noel you're playing Noel to play
[01:37:11] Noel you're not playing her as like a
[01:37:12] I'm going to flex her in a team like you
[01:37:14] can play a Noel team but you're not
[01:37:15] adding her to your sh team to heal
[01:37:17] that's not how you're playing Noel with
[01:37:19] no Barbara why is this the most replayed
[01:37:21] did I [ __ ] up Barbara you're fighting
[01:37:23] like slimes or whatever but in general
[01:37:25] uh it does heal you passively on your
[01:37:27] pieces you can go for HP on the sand and
[01:37:31] then healing bonus on the cir do if you
[01:37:33] want recharge is also viable on your
[01:37:36] pieces the one thing I want to say for
[01:37:37] artifact sets is Barbara is one of the
[01:37:39] few characters where like maidens or
[01:37:41] going for more healing can actually be
[01:37:43] viable the reason for that is because
[01:37:44] while I run her on nobless nobless
[01:37:46] doesn't have the greatest uptime not
[01:37:48] only does her burst cost a lot of energy
[01:37:50] but you don't really want to spam on
[01:37:51] cool down you more so want to use it
[01:37:52] when you need the healing so running for
[01:37:54] no bless on her I just got one guy [ __ ]
[01:37:56] you this is actually fine the only time
[01:37:59] the only thing that well this is two
[01:38:00] years old by the way but the only thing
[01:38:01] that like mainly changed is now there's
[01:38:03] new sets there's like ocean H clam
[01:38:05] there's um song of days past and there's
[01:38:08] finina and finina is the biggest
[01:38:10] thing what does it matter if it's fine
[01:38:11] or not I mean it is a 2-year-old video
[01:38:14] but I would still like to take pride in
[01:38:17] being correct most of the time so if
[01:38:19] there's a mistake I'll correct it
[01:38:21] no rest for the wicked I knew it
[01:38:27] you stun
[01:38:30] locked okay I just realized how long
[01:38:32] this doain is going to take to clear I
[01:38:33] don't even want to clear this
[01:38:36] anymore there's like waves to the [ __ ]
[01:38:39] all right all good
[01:38:42] um boot up Co-op okay
[01:38:50] fine
[01:38:51] what do you think though is the worst
[01:38:52] take you've had uh I don't even want to
[01:38:56] think about
[01:39:02] that
[01:39:09] um stop typing Duality that wasn't a
[01:39:12] take that was a
[01:39:20] screenshot
[01:39:22] you defending beta on every video Back
[01:39:24] Then BET's bro I don't I genuinely don't
[01:39:26] care what people think about this I
[01:39:28] think bet in the situations where she's
[01:39:30] good is absolutely broken and in other
[01:39:32] situations she's good to have to your
[01:39:33] account because worst case you use a
[01:39:35] single Target team and you can clear it
[01:39:36] with ba cuz all the other characters do
[01:39:38] single Target I actually think BET's
[01:39:39] really good I'm I don't care C2 onwards
[01:39:42] fine you can have that C2 onwards I
[01:39:44] think BET's great I think V's really
[01:39:47] good oh I'm not
[01:39:50] ready
[01:39:58] when you saw Bennett was bad cuz he can
[01:39:59] fling himself off cliffs yeah but I
[01:40:01] wasn't making videos back then you only
[01:40:02] know about that cuz the Jeff talks about
[01:40:04] that I was like that was like October
[01:40:07] first when the game came like a day
[01:40:08] after the game came out when I was
[01:40:10] playing off stream as like I didn't
[01:40:12] stream back then well I streamed
[01:40:13] hearstone anyways I was literally dude
[01:40:16] that was I was like I was like 16 no I
[01:40:18] wasn't I was like 19 that was a while
[01:40:20] ago
[01:40:28] oh yeah I'm V on this account base or
[01:40:29] not base chat we have C6 B on this
[01:40:39] account
[01:40:49] um boom
[01:40:51] unlucky oh this could be good actually
[01:40:53] that's actually pretty good this is
[01:40:54] disgusting but this could actually be
[01:40:57] good
[01:41:10] D
[01:41:14] okay you know what okay fine let me let
[01:41:16] me go through a a quick quick five star
[01:41:19] list
[01:41:33] fine okay who did I underrate or
[01:41:35] overrate when they came out let's look
[01:41:38] uh okay I definitely overrated albo uh
[01:41:41] yoia I was on the Mark I don't care [ __ ]
[01:41:43] you I don't care I actually don't care I
[01:41:45] actually don't care I actually don't
[01:41:47] okay sorry uh G was overrated but it
[01:41:50] made sense I don't think she was
[01:41:51] actually like she was overrated but it
[01:41:52] made sense cuz like the team was
[01:41:54] actually broken at the time like she's
[01:41:55] gotten a bit worse since then but like
[01:41:58] at the time the team was actually kind
[01:41:59] of like ventti was the most broken unit
[01:42:01] in the game it wasn't even
[01:42:02] close
[01:42:07] uhto I
[01:42:09] mean eo's go eo's probably a bit
[01:42:11] overrated was not anymore but definely
[01:42:14] was aa's really good Lenny I don't my
[01:42:18] opinion hasn't really changed on Uli
[01:42:20] definitely rated uh but that's that's
[01:42:24] crazy cuz like at the time I was
[01:42:27] underrating her like I overrated her for
[01:42:29] sure but like at the time like the hot
[01:42:32] take was saying she's similar to duuke
[01:42:34] which like isn't even a bad like that
[01:42:36] like it's just because everyone was like
[01:42:37] seeing a [ __ ] million damage
[01:42:39] screenshot it is what it is um I don't
[01:42:42] even remember what I thought about IO I
[01:42:44] know like I've always loved IO I think
[01:42:45] he's great I still think he's good
[01:42:47] except nevertheless better but it
[01:42:48] doesn't matter uh I don't know what my
[01:42:50] first I video was [ __ ] did I think about
[01:42:53] AO Zio
[01:42:56] aoto Zio
[01:43:00] AO uh this is new is this the first one
[01:43:03] first one I made
[01:43:04] right they even talk about how good is
[01:43:07] IO of your skill before moving on I
[01:43:09] wanted to quickly record my thoughts on
[01:43:11] this character as he is new and a lot of
[01:43:12] people ask me on what I think about oh
[01:43:14] this is pred
[01:43:16] dendro it's going to be a bit worse
[01:43:18] pendro cuz you'd rather like to clarify
[01:43:21] his role and his power level I do want
[01:43:22] to say that IO is a powerful onfield
[01:43:25] Auto attacker similar role to child in
[01:43:27] the sense that he wants to have a lot of
[01:43:28] Field Time auto attacking applying AOE
[01:43:30] hydro and doing good damage not only
[01:43:33] will he enable your off field carries to
[01:43:34] do a lot by enabling reactions like
[01:43:36] vaporize or electrocharge or even freeze
[01:43:39] but also he himself does a considerable
[01:43:41] amount I really enjoy IO not only for
[01:43:43] his play style but also because his
[01:43:44] teams are very good dude is B not broken
[01:43:47] here look that's B dude is an IO this
[01:43:52] is element that is wanted in so many
[01:43:54] teams IO is someone who can be used to
[01:43:56] enable those great reactions like freeze
[01:43:58] electrocharge and even vaporize what is
[01:44:00] that B [ __ ] you actually [ __ ] the video
[01:44:03] I believe he's a great option for many
[01:44:04] comps and sometimes even just the best
[01:44:06] character for a specific team comp well
[01:44:08] I might do a direct comparison between
[01:44:10] him and child in another video thank God
[01:44:12] I didn't I cannot stand doing that at
[01:44:15] least say right now that my initial
[01:44:16] Impressions on this character are very
[01:44:18] good okay this theme is a little copium
[01:44:19] though I can't lie
[01:44:21] the team that he can enable allowing you
[01:44:22] to consistently freeze enemies or
[01:44:24] consistently proc elect was a Skyward
[01:44:26] blade I got was so to consistently
[01:44:29] freeze enemies
[01:44:31] or Electro charge as you're on field
[01:44:33] enabler being my personal favorite
[01:44:35] character for Electro taser teams and so
[01:44:37] many more that anyways I think that was
[01:44:40] fine I like I I still agree he just got
[01:44:42] better with d and then
[01:44:45] net
[01:44:48] um who else is there rli's uh rli's
[01:44:52] rizzly I don't even know how I feel
[01:44:53] about rizley BYU got better with finina
[01:44:57] NE n came out right before Dita right
[01:45:00] yeah dude they did n so [ __ ] dirty n
[01:45:02] is great I love Neu but they did n so
[01:45:04] dirty dude they literally released her
[01:45:07] right before Nita so it was like your
[01:45:09] dendro options were dendro MC and Cole
[01:45:12] and there's no yao yao and there's no
[01:45:13] Kirara and there's no Al height them and
[01:45:15] it's like could you make a team with DMC
[01:45:18] Cole n kakomi yeah it was F it was
[01:45:20] actually like it's okay like a lot of
[01:45:22] her free play teams are still good they
[01:45:23] you do that with Barbara instead of Ki
[01:45:25] it's still fine but uh Nikita or even
[01:45:29] like Yao yaa or Kirara or alham are all
[01:45:31] pretty good in her team
[01:45:33] so yeah I don't
[01:45:36] know
[01:45:38] um
[01:45:42] yeah why is chori
[01:45:45] here why is Tori
[01:45:48] here what do they know about about
[01:45:56] chori can you play soia a little higher
[01:45:58] I'm new this isn't a [ __ ] tier list
[01:46:01] please don't take this as a tier list
[01:46:03] this is what I made like five streams
[01:46:04] ago about who I want on my account like
[01:46:07] who I like who I would pull for as a new
[01:46:10] it's not even like a who you should pull
[01:46:11] for it's who I personally would be like
[01:46:13] I kind of want to pull this isn't a tier
[01:46:15] list stop
[01:46:17] it matter of fact if it is a tier list
[01:46:20] [ __ ] you you think I care yeah sorry
[01:46:22] sorry sorry sorry sorry I
[01:46:29] like she's not
[01:46:32] [Applause]
[01:46:35] bad close to me or you might get hit by
[01:46:38] lightning
[01:46:44] too rank the standards in terms of how
[01:46:47] much I would pull for
[01:46:49] them I don't even remember what this
[01:46:51] list
[01:46:52] was
[01:46:54] uh I Like Big T's teams I don't really
[01:46:57] care about the like the rest of him like
[01:47:00] I like playing like the fact that I can
[01:47:03] play Yi fishal in a team plus him makes
[01:47:06] me like them but outside of that I don't
[01:47:08] really
[01:47:09] care in terms of if you want to build
[01:47:13] them I would consider de I definitely
[01:47:16] would like unironically I definitely
[01:47:17] would I I hope she she like was is
[01:47:19] better than she
[01:47:21] is but I still definitely would get
[01:47:24] her
[01:47:26] um who the [ __ ] else is there Chichi no
[01:47:29] I mean okay I actually like played
[01:47:31] Chi-Chi when I was
[01:47:34] new
[01:47:36] uh who even is there duuke yeah I
[01:47:39] [ __ ] love duuke okay okay outdated
[01:47:41] take but I I I like
[01:47:45] theuk I like
[01:47:49] him
[01:47:54] I like him
[01:47:57] lying I like him Jean's all Jean's all
[01:48:02] and uh kaching is cool kaching pred
[01:48:04] dendral I probably I actually played
[01:48:07] okay 1.0 Z played kaching in the OR 1.1
[01:48:11] played kaching in the second half of the
[01:48:12] Abyss as the second DPS even when she
[01:48:14] was just kind of mid um but with that I
[01:48:17] do like her I would definitely get her
[01:48:19] she's also purple I think any uh uh the
[01:48:23] okay I hoo okay whenever hoo makes a
[01:48:26] purple okay whenever a gacha game makes
[01:48:28] a purple-haired uh uh uh woman or pink
[01:48:31] usually they Peak for the not always
[01:48:34] it's like a 80% chance so I do like
[01:48:38] theing
[01:48:46] um is that all the
[01:48:49] standards
[01:48:56] mod check Mona oh
[01:49:00] um I really wanted Mona at the start
[01:49:02] because I didn't have her but now that I
[01:49:04] have her I kind of I use kakomi dude I'm
[01:49:07] sorry I'm such a kakomi lover that like
[01:49:09] anytime I want a kakomi hydro I just
[01:49:11] kakomi and like Mona's kit feels it's
[01:49:14] it's I like the like
[01:49:16] burst and I remember I was rrolling on
[01:49:18] this account and I got like this is my
[01:49:20] count I got Mona I was like super hype
[01:49:22] but I feel like she just feels like a
[01:49:24] clunky kakomi like I know there's ways

[02:05:25] me go get Crystal
[02:05:27] flies sorry I'm I don't know why I'm
[02:05:30] absent minded only experience being a
[02:05:33] stormtrooper what I don't
[02:05:47] miss
[02:06:04] uh my [ __ ] okay the shout video is
[02:06:06] done I'm going to have to rewatch after
[02:06:07] the Stream So surely it'll be up soon
[02:06:09] how long is it let me let me see Z's
[02:06:11] video jump scare oh it's still uh oh
[02:06:13] it's still processing it's six gigabytes
[02:06:16] I'm downloading it uh oh
[02:06:27] I'll be
[02:06:30] fine not another sh video on dude it's a
[02:06:34] good video I don't even make that many
[02:06:36] shower videos thumbnail sneak peek sure
[02:06:46] uh sure
[02:06:50] the will this is with the team this is
[02:06:52] without the team I don't know which one
[02:06:53] I'll use yet it's like a it's it's like
[02:06:56] a the first like I don't know however
[02:06:58] many minutes is a review and then it's a
[02:07:00] guide It's like a two in one cuz I don't
[02:07:01] want to make two
[02:07:04] videos without okay I got do
[02:07:09] without I don't know I could also
[02:07:12] there's also the like feature where you
[02:07:13] could do two and then see which one gets
[02:07:14] clicked on more like YouTube added that
[02:07:16] recently so some it only lasts like a
[02:07:18] day or some [ __ ] so as I've been trying
[02:07:20] that just to like
[02:07:25] see but the thing is only so the reason
[02:07:27] why I'm doing it like this is cuz I have
[02:07:28] a lot I just want to talk about with
[02:07:29] Shia but I also don't want to just make
[02:07:31] it a review and then not talk about
[02:07:32] build so I included a build section but
[02:07:33] I didn't want to remake the whole guide
[02:07:35] stuff cuz my like actual sh guide uh is
[02:07:39] like 40 minutes
[02:07:41] long and so although I think I should
[02:07:43] use the white thumbnail for that one I
[02:07:45] think I [ __ ] up but it doesn't matter
[02:07:46] so if you actually care about like
[02:07:47] Combos and like stuff watch this uh like
[02:07:51] that part but then the the teams are
[02:07:52] like outdated and like the builds are
[02:07:54] like outdated well no that's not
[02:07:55] outdated but like there's Mar now
[02:07:57] there's weapons now there's like shenu
[02:07:59] and there's finina so that is like what
[02:08:00] I remade cuz he does deserve a new video
[02:08:03] but I don't want to like like the combos
[02:08:04] are all the same
[02:08:06] so
[02:08:11] yeah hello Zach roll an artifact beside
[02:08:16] Shia wait but I don't think Shia in my
[02:08:18] world right now but I can roll the
[02:08:19] artifact next to [ __ ] vaita look
[02:08:22] we'll see if Vita's lucky all right
[02:08:23] there you go uh what should we roll I'm
[02:08:26] going to close my eyes click on an
[02:08:28] artifact and then we're going to roll it
[02:08:29] if it's plus
[02:08:32] zero okay if it's locked it has to be
[02:08:35] locked it has to be
[02:08:36] locked actually I'll just pick a locked
[02:08:38] one Whatever uh first locked one I see
[02:08:40] when I stop scrolling boom okay we're
[02:08:43] rolling
[02:08:44] this this is your artifact if it gets e
[02:08:47] HP
[02:08:56] B um I don't think we have a good piece
[02:08:59] we can roll
[02:09:00] honestly maybe I should start unlocking
[02:09:03] some [ __ ] this Hydro goet could be good
[02:09:05] if this guy crit damage 700 gifted I'm
[02:09:07] not joking okay I was actually I was I I
[02:09:10] wasn't joking but I was lying so I'm
[02:09:12] happy it didn't happen
[02:09:17] um
[02:09:21] what if I just roll this piece for fun
[02:09:23] [ __ ] it I hope it goes bad so I don't
[02:09:25] have to keep
[02:09:26] it this is like definitely the wrong set
[02:09:28] but it is what it is okay it rolls flat

[02:14:10] ging oh
[02:14:15] [ __ ] I looked up get back how to build
[02:14:17] the best sh team in order to have the
[02:14:20] most fun oh my God the Tik Tok voice I'm
[02:14:23] going to lose it sorry sorry sorry sorry
[02:14:25] you need to use I hate this I actually
[02:14:27] can't send this voice my dad started he
[02:14:29] like actually is a t he literally like
[02:14:31] Scrolls Tik Tok now and so I hear it
[02:14:33] sometimes it drives me insane it drives
[02:14:35] me insane like Tik Tok is fine but that
[02:14:38] voice I can't use a shielder uh not a
[02:14:40] you know for casual audience which is
[02:14:43] mostly what shorts is this is a fine
[02:14:45] it's not needed but sure some enemies
[02:14:47] like to ruin your fun you'll also want
[02:14:49] to use someone who will make him hit
[02:14:51] harder like faren or
[02:14:53] Mona yes yes I don't know about the or
[02:14:56] Mona but yes I
[02:14:59] mean sorry sorry why is why is why is
[02:15:01] she in the Healer like or all good it's
[02:15:05] uh casual content I'm not going to like
[02:15:06] backseat play what you want uh I will
[02:15:09] you know do what you want to
[02:15:10] do Benny boy but shenan is his best some
[02:15:14] people also play him with Raiden and
[02:15:16] Yellen Raiden acts as a battery this
[02:15:19] actually okay Shon is an actual team uh
[02:15:24] it's not my cup of tea but it it you
[02:15:26] actually
[02:15:27] can y andal attack and I'm telling yall
[02:15:31] use
[02:15:34] prote in order to have the most fun with
[02:15:38] show you
[02:15:40] need I
[02:15:42] mean this not the
[02:15:45] worst constructive criticism you know
[02:15:48] not disliking the video hey no no
[02:15:49] disrespect constructive criticism uh
[02:15:53] shielder nice for Comfort not needed
[02:15:55] it's not like the number one but it's
[02:15:57] nice I actually I remember I was playing
[02:15:59] uh Scara right as he came out in the
[02:16:01] abyss and it was annoying to play him
[02:16:03] without a shield so I get it but scar is
[02:16:04] also floating it's a bit different Shia
[02:16:06] if you get good at Shia you can dodge
[02:16:07] very easily because you're jumping in
[02:16:09] the air enemies often times don't hit
[02:16:10] you in the air sometimes they do but
[02:16:12] like a lot of enemies will like do a
[02:16:13] grounded thing you can like float in the
[02:16:14] air to dodge it you get better at it but
[02:16:16] jle is one of his best teammates C6 Toma
[02:16:18] as well Leila's a little copium but you
[02:16:20] know no disrespect TOA um afterwards you
[02:16:24] definitely want an anemo battery not
[02:16:26] just a damage buffer let's say I follow
[02:16:28] this video and I'm like okay I need uh a
[02:16:30] shielder right let me let me do an
[02:16:31] example so let's say I need a shielder
[02:16:33] okay and I'm doing let's okay whatever I
[02:16:36] need a shielder so this is my base team
[02:16:37] then I'm like okay I'm going to run a
[02:16:38] Healer I'm going to do healing finina
[02:16:40] then I'm going to do uh there's a damage
[02:16:41] off her like farzon or Mona first of all
[02:16:44] if I put farzon and she's not C6 here
[02:16:46] this is the worst team of all time watch
[02:16:47] mo.com top 10 worst teams of all time if
[02:16:49] she's C6 you know it is what it is but
[02:16:52] so let me remove her uh let's say
[02:16:54] hypothetically I don't have Faron and
[02:16:56] I'm like okay I'm going to put Mona here
[02:16:57] now you might notice a very glaring and
[02:17:00] uh glazing issue which is that this team
[02:17:03] generates on average one particle every
[02:17:06] one to two patches so what's going to
[02:17:08] happen is your sh's going to lament once
[02:17:10] and then you will never lament again for
[02:17:12] the rest of your life that's actually
[02:17:13] true um depending on the life
[02:17:15] expectancies uh based on you know a lot
[02:17:17] of fact so uh what I would cuz farita
[02:17:19] generates Zero Energy with her healing
[02:17:22] stats Jeong Lee generates once uh when
[02:17:24] you're it's a 50% chance when your
[02:17:26] pillar hits an enemy Jang Le's pillar
[02:17:27] breaks if the wind is too strong so
[02:17:29] that's zero particles and then Mona is
[02:17:31] Mona so you're probably going to need
[02:17:33] 700 ER on Sha uh with that in mind you
[02:17:37] doing a generous interpretation of some
[02:17:39] of the stuff that was mentioned there
[02:17:41] you could make a better team uh let's
[02:17:42] say I do a Healer you said Shen yun's
[02:17:44] the best shenyun is actually really good
[02:17:46] here true so so let's say do shant she's
[02:17:49] level 77 I forgot let's say where the
[02:17:51] [ __ ] is
[02:17:53] shenu Jeepers oh there she is let's see
[02:17:56] sh um and then last thought you said a
[02:17:59] damage buffer like fars on this actually
[02:18:01] a decent team uh personally I would
[02:18:04] recommend finina or Bennett instead of
[02:18:06] sh Le but you know this works oops I all
[02:18:08] time this going work uh the
[02:18:12] problem you'll also want to use someone
[02:18:14] who will make him hit harder like faren
[02:18:16] or Mona you'll also want a Healer like
[02:18:19] finina or Benny boy but Shen is his best
[02:18:24] yeah all good um I wouldn't recommend uh
[02:18:28] finina as the Healer I love finina
[02:18:30] finina is one of the best characters not
[02:18:33] just overall but also in a sh team
[02:18:35] however you would typically want to use
[02:18:36] her as a damage dealer in that team
[02:18:38] because not only is her damage high but
[02:18:40] she also doesn't give you any energy as
[02:18:42] a Healer and that's important because if
[02:18:43] you don't make healing if you don't
[02:18:45] generate
[02:18:46] energy uh uh then your whole team is a
[02:18:49] little [ __ ] depending on your team
[02:18:51] check out the comments I need use
[02:18:54] protection when having fun with Shia bro
[02:18:56] bro bro bro bro Shia's best team should
[02:19:00] be final fantasy 20 true
[02:19:04] actually that is the best team
[02:19:16] ffxx
[02:19:20] all good not a not a bad
[02:19:23] video but I will say I think uh
[02:19:26] personally the the order of building a
[02:19:29] Shia team is Shia and then anemo battery
[02:19:31] you want another Nemo character always
[02:19:33] and then unless you're doing like
[02:19:34] [ __ ] pyro Shia but if you are you're
[02:19:36] playing shun on that team so yeah pyro
[02:19:38] battery then healer sorry ano [ __ ] an
[02:19:42] emo battery then healer and then Flex
[02:19:43] the flex either damage buffer well a lot
[02:19:45] of times your batter is damage buffer
[02:19:46] you're playing uh uh Faron but flexx it
[02:19:48] could be a buffer it could be a off
[02:19:49] field support it could be [ __ ] Ryden
[02:19:50] it could be [ __ ] whatever you
[02:20:01] want now just go fav
[02:20:05] true somebody asked if SE war farzon is
[02:20:07] good enough se4 farzon is good enough it
[02:20:09] is it's just like it's just if you're
[02:20:11] like it's like let's say you like have
[02:20:14] nothing like okay it's like if you know
[02:20:16] you're like like okay man I'm hungry but
[02:20:18] there's like nothing really in your
[02:20:19] house except you have like maybe some
[02:20:21] like like like you know like a old like
[02:20:24] you have like something like stale uh
[02:20:26] like stale um okay it's like it's like
[02:20:30] if you have like stale bread it's like
[02:20:32] it'll feed you but I'd rather have
[02:20:35] something like a bit more nutritious or
[02:20:37] tasty right like you know it's better
[02:20:39] than nothing and it it's not like it's
[02:20:41] not like you don't have anything to eat
[02:20:43] you're not starving
[02:20:45] right maybe you just need to go to the
[02:20:47] store but it's closed it's like midnight
[02:20:48] let's say this is a better analogy it's
[02:20:50] midnight right it's not like you don't
[02:20:51] have any food it's like [ __ ] I can't get
[02:20:54] any food there's nothing I would go to
[02:20:55] the store but it's closed all I have
[02:20:57] left is like this old bread and it's
[02:20:59] like okay well I could sleep and just
[02:21:01] wake up tomorrow and go eat or I could
[02:21:03] just eat this bread and it's better than
[02:21:05] nothing and C6 farizon would be like a
[02:21:06] nice freshly baked steamy baguette that
[02:21:09] is C6 farizon but c0 C2 C4 it's like the
[02:21:13] it's like old bread you have it's okay
[02:21:16] it's it's not going to kill you it's
[02:21:17] it's going to feed you I I've had old
[02:21:19] bread for you know a meal uh sometimes
[02:21:23] you just do what you got to do a lot of
[02:21:24] times you know it's fine but it's not
[02:21:28] the
[02:21:35] same
[02:21:42] shine why is Pon
[02:21:46] talking
[02:21:48] why you talking about C6 Faron again cuz
[02:21:49] someone asked and also I said this
[02:21:51] before but I was taking a shower today
[02:21:52] and I ran out of shampoo and so I had to
[02:21:54] fill it with water and like squeeze the
[02:21:56] last bit out and that was it felt like I
[02:21:58] was using a c0o Faron instead of a C6
[02:22:00] one where my shampoo bottle would be
[02:22:01] full so I've been thinking about farzon
[02:22:04] uh this could be good also em goblet St
[02:22:06] lock all right let's
[02:22:08] go that cold pizza too if I remember
[02:22:11] correctly from the day prior how the
[02:22:13] [ __ ] do you know about me eating cold
[02:22:14] pizza all the only I didn't even stream
[02:22:16] on that day just typed once in fb's chat

[02:23:02] was like why did okay that's also a
[02:23:04] concerning name

[02:24:30] their mind like they didn't like consent
[02:24:32] to being mind red like they don't know
[02:24:34] we're reading their minds is that [ __ ]
[02:24:35] up is Nita a criminal I don't know I'm
[02:24:37] reading your mind so even acads can get
[02:24:39] into a
[02:24:41] fight better steer clear of us is he
[02:24:43] talking about [ __ ] alight
[02:24:45] them
[02:24:48] what are you thinking okay what are you
[02:24:50] thinking we'd have to close the
[02:24:52] blacksmiths to treat the air but if it
[02:24:55] gets shut down I'll have nothing to
[02:24:56] write about for my thesis too hey don't
[02:25:00] shut him down look at
[02:25:02] him I see everything I hope the children
[02:25:05] are doing well what a Chad this guy's
[02:25:07] awesome you know what I'll give you
[02:25:09] business today good sir I'll give you
[02:25:11] business I'd like to purchase your
[02:25:13] finest weapon yep give me a silver sword
[02:25:15] I'll take a iron Point too thank you
[02:25:17] good sir thank
[02:25:21] you read Catherine's mine I thought it
[02:25:23] was dot dot dot isn't it I'm pretty sure
[02:25:25] I've already done
[02:25:26] this I think cather's just a dot dot
[02:25:32] dot yeah did I miss Port ormo theme sumu
[02:25:36] is so peak man I'm
[02:25:40] sorry let me play My
[02:25:45] Rewards
[02:25:56] shout only Abyss run when uh the problem
[02:25:58] with shout only is that uh you drain
[02:26:01] your HP which means if this [ __ ]
[02:26:04] touches me once I'm
[02:26:08] dead I think I could do it
[02:26:12] though
[02:26:15] Dodge
[02:26:18] I mean I'm not against that idea we'd
[02:26:20] have to go engulfing probably
[02:26:32] though what the [ __ ] is Dodge it's
[02:26:37] Dodge we haven't done a really hard
[02:26:39] challenge yet I want to I need to make a
[02:26:41] new challenge I think we're going to do
[02:26:42] the abyss with every single
[02:26:44] character without reusing them
[02:26:49] gifted randomizer randomizer is too easy
[02:26:51] now well okay not easy but like it's too
[02:26:53] like default like I feel like I've done
[02:26:56] randomizer like five
[02:26:57] times it's too like Cookie
[02:27:03] Cutter I think the the like videos that
[02:27:06] are like new that I would make that I
[02:27:08] haven't done before would
[02:27:11] be
[02:27:13] uh doing your abysses doing Abyss with
[02:27:18] every single character but I can't reuse
[02:27:19] them after I use one so we have to make
[02:27:21] like [ __ ] teams and it'll actually be
[02:27:23] hard cuz I have to have every character
[02:27:24] built uh using teams you guys suggest
[02:27:29] reacting to your genin videos which I
[02:27:31] think is kind of cringe but I think it
[02:27:33] could make a good video uh and there's
[02:27:36] another
[02:27:38] one I don't know what
[02:27:45] else o to solo oaha uh I did you one
[02:27:49] better I soloed oaha with only
[02:27:51] guoba o would be probably
[02:27:55] easier all better off
[02:28:03] time did you know that the sound of
[02:28:06] thunder what the
[02:28:10] [ __ ] that's [ __ ] that's actually
[02:28:12] [ __ ] that's [ __ ] Ryden just [ __ ]
[02:28:16] beefed with
[02:28:19] the she said [ __ ]

[02:28:25] be honest you think my sh solos or no
[02:28:27] how much AR do I have is that even
[02:28:28] that's probably

[04:24:29] scammed but I'll do another this person
[04:24:31] you need if you have a constellation of
[04:24:33] any five star you are not eligible just

[04:24:38] like I'm not talk about all of chat but
[04:24:39] like those of you who are cringe I feel
[04:24:41] like you're cringe like for reference I
[04:24:44] get it I don't want to pull on an
[04:24:46] account that's not going to use Shia
[04:24:48] however I said criteria and they F fit
[04:24:51] them so why would I like scam them right
[04:24:54] like I'm not going to do that like for
[04:24:58] example they said you scammed the first
[04:25:00] guy but when I said if you're ar60
[04:25:02] you're not eligible and they're ar60
[04:25:03] they're like oh okay I get it like they
[04:25:04] weren't mad about it you guys are being
[04:25:06] mad about it that aren't the person the
[04:25:08] person uh I think I remember their
[04:25:10] user think is this was there an
[04:25:12] underscore yeah there was an underscore
[04:25:15] like for
[04:25:18] example for example yeah that's
[04:25:24] fine
[04:25:30] anyways
[04:25:34] anyways uh I did top up for you more
[04:25:36] than the PS I used I think was only
[04:25:41] 20 so you didn't lose anything I will do
[04:25:44] one more
[04:25:48] reset uh but also like this is why I
[04:25:51] think giveaways and a lot of streamers
[04:25:53] that bait for giveaways it's like not my
[04:25:55] cup of tea CU it always ends up with
[04:25:57] [ __ ] like this I don't like it like it's

[04:26:16] more ar45 or lower would be nice no cuz
[04:26:20] like sure but that shouldn't be a

[04:32:02] [Music]
[04:32:04] it
[04:32:13] turn old play you're [ __ ] yeah the
[04:32:14] only reason I initially was trying not
[04:32:16] to do an a60 wasn't cuz they played for
[04:32:18] a while it's cuz I don't want an account
[04:32:20] that looks like they wouldn't use sh but
[04:32:22] if it's an account that literally has
[04:32:24] shenyun C6 fars on double crown fars on
[04:32:27] and like their DVS is like a c0 Yia and
[04:32:29] it looks like they would use a Shia then
[04:32:31] I would rather do that than a random low
[04:32:33] AR like not necessarily low AR but a
[04:32:34] random other account that was my logic
[04:32:36] behind it you're free to disagree but
[04:32:39] it's also my money and I don't
[04:32:42] really need to explain it so
[04:32:45] [Music]
[04:32:49] yeah I need The Code by the way uh use
[04:32:56] dog like I'd rather give an Animo main
[04:33:00] an anemo character than a random like
[04:33:02] not to say other people on but like I'd
[04:33:04] rather go to an anemo main than someone
[04:33:05] who's just like hey I want a
[04:33:07] character as an anemo enjoyer
[04:33:10] myself especially cuz the character is

[04:49:55] we do I have con
[04:49:57] resin I
[04:50:01] do sorry
[04:50:07] let's end on a strong note does anyone
[04:50:08] know the song name it's called partners
[04:50:10] in crime I set it
[04:50:19] off we are using Shia and we are
[04:50:32] lamenting
[04:50:43] any resin refresh stories I didn't even
[04:50:45] res refresh okay well I did like four
[04:50:47] but I didn't like overcap my res I
[04:50:50] started like not overa I didn't over my
[04:50:52] resin was not
[04:50:54] overcapped it's at like my resin right
[04:50:56] now is at [ __ ] 21 21 can you do
[04:51:00] something for me can you talk to the
[04:51:04] next
[04:51:06] for
[04:51:11] sorry
[04:51:14] oh I mean this could these could get
[04:51:17] crit damage
[04:51:19] technically technically could be
[04:51:22] good could be good
[04:51:32] technically shine man slaying dude I'm
[04:51:35] telling you Shia's insane right now yes
[04:51:37] the comp is a little bit wait I just did
[04:51:39] 90k what am I doing whatever I mean
[04:51:42] typically it's pretty
[04:51:45] good it's like two three plunges they're
[04:51:47] dead although okay to be fair I'm on
[04:51:49] [ __ ] ER well 140 is not even a
[04:51:57] lot okay
[04:52:02] okay
[04:52:05] ruin grater count I don't want to check
[04:52:08] my ruin grater count
[04:52:10] dude they put a run grader like last
[04:52:12] abys or some [ __ ] so it scuffed it a
[04:52:22] little 160 let's do the age old
[04:52:26] technique of equipping our Iron
[04:52:32] Point
[04:52:39] one day I'm going to click and it's
[04:52:40] going to be anemo damage and then
[04:52:41] there's going to be crit rate crit
[04:52:42] damage and then like attack and it's
[04:52:44] going to be the best day of
[04:52:47] my had the time of my life and I never F
[04:52:53] this way
[04:52:55] sorry Gambler mindset no it's not it's
[04:52:59] going to happen disappear and I swear
[04:53:04] this is
[04:53:05] [Music]
[04:53:08] true
[04:53:14] 104 104k with iron
[04:53:17] point I feel like Bennett would give us
[04:53:19] a lot of uh damage though probably over
[04:53:22] forena
[04:53:26] here y unlucky Y
[04:53:31] no 10 years from now I feel like on
[04:53:34] average I'm do one like I know the odds
[04:53:37] for an onset goblet with double crit is
[04:53:39] like really high I remember like 1.0 or
[04:53:42] 1.1 like zag Cal it I remember but like
[04:53:46] it
[04:53:48] dude at like I am at the
[04:53:51] like if you look at like the like the
[04:53:54] probability Parabola I'm like at like
[04:53:57] the highest peak that's not a okay if
[04:54:00] you look at like the the quadratic
[04:54:02] formula I'm definitely a VAR o this
[04:54:05] could be good I'm definitely a variable
[04:54:06] right
[04:54:11] now odds of goblet resin genin
[04:54:20] impact okay I'm going to take these
[04:54:22] random ass numbers as objectively true
[04:54:25] let's say it's a 001 6% chance per 20
[04:54:28] resin how what would the percentage be
[04:54:31] given how much resin I spent
[04:54:39] Cal let's say I spend like I don't know
[04:54:42] 160,000 divide that by 20 that's 8,000
[04:54:48] 8,000 times this divided by 100 because
[04:54:51] it's
[04:54:57] percent well that's not really how it
[04:54:59] works actually that's actually not how
[04:55:01] probabilities work there's a [ __ ]
[04:55:02] equation wait let me pull the
[04:55:04] equation
[04:55:05] uh
[04:55:07] probability wait wait there's one
[04:55:09] there's actually one I've used this
[04:55:11] before wait wa wait I know what this
[04:55:13] is
[04:55:21] all I have one sec I have the website
[04:55:23] open well I don't know okay this isn't
[04:55:25] the this isn't the like formula but this
[04:55:28] website works I know I know I I know it
[04:55:30] works but I don't know how the [ __ ] to
[04:55:32] convert what we just saw what was the
[04:55:36] percent
[04:55:40] 00166 what
[04:55:44] 0 wait It's divided by 100 no no no no
[04:55:47] cuz that's percent yeah yeah so
[04:55:50] 0
[04:55:52] .00 was it
[04:56:02] 166 what but that's per 20
[04:56:05] resin uh how do I type how many runs I
[04:56:08] did oh I could do that here so
[04:56:13] 8,000 what okay but I think perfect is
[04:56:17] like perfectly
[04:56:19] rolling three zeros is not four yeah but
[04:56:21] it's zero point isn't it or was it just
[04:56:23] zero wait what did they
[04:56:30] say did they mean zero point or just
[04:56:33] [ __ ] oh
[04:56:37] well oh this doesn't yeah this does not
[04:56:40] seem right let me see what they
[04:56:47] did I don't think they're equal by the
[04:56:49] way but
[04:56:57] sure
[04:57:01] what yo
[04:57:07] uh yeah I know I know they're not
[04:57:10] equal okay this is
[04:57:13] that real senses are not
[04:57:17] equal
[04:57:20] uh however when your calcul not perfect
[04:57:22] circle just an artifact with four
[04:57:24] preferred sub
[04:57:25] stats rolls five that's 11 zeros before
[04:57:29] the nine let's round it up to 1 eus 10
[04:57:32] which is 0 zero yeah one in 10 billion
[04:57:36] yo what am I
[04:57:58] reading no I know that I cuz I remember
[04:58:01] I actually talked to Z about this a
[04:58:02] while ago the odds for like an actually
[04:58:05] perfect like Max roll everything is like
[04:58:07] literally impossible like one player
[04:58:09] will get it or some [ __ ] but like that's
[04:58:12] not true because
[04:58:14] like like let's say I'm looking for an
[04:58:16] anemo on Vermilion well it's like well
[04:58:19] what if someone
[04:58:21] like there's the same chance that
[04:58:23] someone gets an anemo on Vermillion than
[04:58:25] like a hydro or pyro or cry assuming
[04:58:27] they're all the same so like you're
[04:58:28] going to see more perfect pieces but the
[04:58:30] maight will be different but anyways uh
[04:58:33] uh I don't mean perfect perfect I mean
[04:58:35] like I just want crit damage and crit
[04:58:37] rate and
[04:58:39] like come like I don't need attack and
[04:58:43] ER and Max rolls I just need the
[04:58:54] rolls yeah four liner well four liner
[04:58:57] also a big thing but it's
[04:58:58] like if I get a thre liner and it it
[04:59:01] only rolls crit it's still good like in
[04:59:04] my eyes it's not like perfect but in in
[04:59:07] my eyes it's still good
[04:59:12] enough it's
[04:59:22] fine what if I look at this redded post
[04:59:25] you think you think that this person did
[04:59:27] the
[04:59:29] math what are are you farming blizz St
[04:59:32] domain for your future IA want know the
[04:59:33] chances of the best possible artifact
[04:59:35] for her oh oh wait blizzard Strayer oh
[04:59:38] I'm so glad you mentioned blizzard
[04:59:40] Strayer so uh perfect artifact for her
[04:59:43] are you talking about something uh
[04:59:45] something uh a little like uh you know
[04:59:49] sorry um well a random person being
[04:59:52] picked out of the entire world's
[04:59:53] population one and8 billion let's make
[04:59:56] an easy calculation blizzard trayer
[04:59:58] artifact one out of two blizzard trayer
[05:00:00] goblet one out of 10 cuz
[05:00:04] cry damage goblet the chance of getting
[05:00:06] a specific element on go is 5% so we
[05:00:07] divide by 20 1 and 200 uh goblet cry
[05:00:11] damage and four initial substats that's
[05:00:13] 20% one in a th uh two sub have to be
[05:00:17] crit rate and crit damage according to
[05:00:18] the wiki n so we divide by 15 one in
[05:00:22] 15,000 getting the above and having all
[05:00:24] substats rolling to crit rate and crit
[05:00:25] damage at plus 20 we have five substats
[05:00:28] and each basically need to win a 50/50
[05:00:30] for them to roll crit rate crit damage
[05:00:31] so we divide by two
[05:00:35] assuming it's not weade right uh five
[05:00:38] times in other words we divide by 32 1
[05:00:40] and 480,000
[05:00:46] wait that's doable though I know you
[05:00:49] want like this is like I don't care
[05:00:50] about like max rolling like that's not
[05:00:52] what I'm going after like I get then
[05:00:54] that's when it goes into like the
[05:00:55] billions but one in 480,000 that's like
[05:00:57] doable right cuz we've so one in 480,000
[05:01:00] pieces right listen shut the up 40 oh no
[05:01:04] it's pieces cuz we only spent cuz it's
[05:01:06] 20 resin per two piece one one point
[05:01:10] something pieces okay never mind never
[05:01:12] mind cuz this is basically like uh if we
[05:01:14] make this as like the amount of like uh
[05:01:16] uh uh runs that's like times 20 right
[05:01:18] per resin although it's not really 20
[05:01:20] cuz it's 1 point something per artifact
[05:01:21] so let's do like times 18 yeah that's a
[05:01:23] lot
[05:01:29] okay yeah we're
[05:01:31] [ __ ]
[05:01:38] 6.5% chance for double artifacts from a
[05:01:40] single domain
[05:01:44] run if you want it proba for a single
[05:01:47] run multiply the odds by
[05:01:49] 1.63 wait let's do that
[05:01:53] 1.63
[05:01:55] 1.63 time what the [ __ ] was it
[05:01:58] 480k yeah
[05:02:01] 48k
[05:02:16] oh 1.0 65 oh [ __ ]
[05:02:30] oops 511k
[05:02:37] wait is this 51,000 runs or
[05:02:42] 51,000 you the probably for a single run
[05:02:46] or p is
[05:02:52] it yeah it's pieces it's pieces but no
[05:02:56] no no it was pieces and then we multiply
[05:02:57] by the Run cuz
[05:03:01] it's
[05:03:07] yeah yeah yeah run it's run it's run
[05:03:09] it's run it's
[05:03:10] run s said balding
[05:03:17] math multiplied the wrong thing did we
[05:03:20] cuz wait wait maybe I did wait I
[05:03:22] multiplied
[05:03:24] the rolling a piece and having it all
[05:03:27] roll to CR crit
[05:03:29] damage but to be fair like we don't need
[05:03:31] it to be a for for St oh [ __ ] we don't
[05:03:34] need it to be a for St and we don't need
[05:03:37] it to
[05:03:38] like I mean I think that's the only
[05:03:58] thing oh yeah it's more probable not
[05:04:01] less probable right cuz there's a chance
[05:04:03] you get double artifacts so I made it
[05:04:05] less probable instead of more
[05:04:14] probable to divide like I multiplied
[05:04:17] instead of dividing because it goes more
[05:04:19] probable I was it yeah okay that makes
[05:04:22] sense wait so is
[05:04:31] it
[05:04:34] I just divide it
[05:04:38] again yeah okay that's like basically
[05:04:40] the same well it's not it's [ __ ] 30k
[05:04:42] different
[05:04:44] but that doesn't make that doesn't
[05:04:46] reassure
[05:04:51] me that's how many pieces so then if I
[05:04:54] want
[05:04:55] to
[05:05:01] okay
[05:05:16] [Music]
[05:05:18] well let's do another run maybe this
[05:05:19] will be the
[05:05:27] one it's not that's a probability really
[05:05:30] is that what they said wait let me read
[05:05:31] this again
[05:05:33] it's 500 a.m. chat give me a
[05:05:35] break
[05:05:39] uh oh yeah it is
[05:05:41] probability yeah what in
[05:05:46] that I mean do you want do we want to do
[05:05:48] this
[05:05:49] again one in what was it 450 is let's
[05:05:52] say 450
[05:06:01] is
[05:06:28] have fun with this okay to be fair
[05:06:30] though all I need okay
[05:06:32] to be
[05:06:34] honest assuming all I need is a [ __ ]
[05:06:37] flower and I go offset goblet it's
[05:06:39] actually really likely like for the
[05:06:41] flower the odd cuz you don't need a Main
[05:06:43] St for flower it's actually
[05:06:48] likely dude a flower versus an an Nemo
[05:06:51] damage goblet is like
[05:07:00] insane you see what this could be
[05:07:15] sh let me level the circlet I got
[05:07:23] [Music]
[05:07:28] though
[05:07:31] okay
[05:08:01] for
[05:08:05] chy what if this guy Critter
