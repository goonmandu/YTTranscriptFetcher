[00:03:04] that's [ __ ] up even though different
[00:03:07] creatures have varying habits and ways
[00:03:09] of communicating the emotions we
[00:03:11] experience are all the same
[00:03:13] I can feel its anxiety and fear that's
[00:03:16] [ __ ] up dude every I'm gonna say it
[00:03:19] why is every gunshon Quest like oh my
[00:03:21] God hilly trolls are people too oh my
[00:03:23] God the fungus are just cute like us and
[00:03:25] can think like us and then we have to
[00:03:27] farm all of them for like a common chest
[00:03:30] dude what the [ __ ] is happening
[00:03:34] [Music]
[00:03:38] Bongo head is a really nice fungus you
[00:03:40] know true that's true
[00:03:42] all right lead the way little fungus
[00:03:47] oh no look about the same some fungi are
[00:03:50] friendly you're falling oh I guess you
[00:03:52] could say he's a fun guy
[00:03:55] why is there a dog here
[00:03:57] eyes
[00:03:59] turn like fierce
[00:04:00] months
[00:04:06] you're hot or not and it's already be
[00:04:08] too late for them once humans have drawn
[00:04:10] their weapons
[00:04:12] hence why they tend to strike first
[00:04:14] rather than waiting
[00:04:17] not too different from
[00:04:19] house things sometimes
[00:04:21] wait what the [ __ ] is happening yo
[00:04:28] [Music]
[00:04:31] not this thing I have nothing
[00:04:42] hurry studs
[00:04:45] it's like they might be family
[00:04:47] so maybe this fungus wanted to bring the
[00:04:49] heaters
[00:04:51] family member
[00:04:52] this is like a quest by Peta they're
[00:04:54] like stop slaughtering the fungi and
[00:04:56] then there's like it cuts like a
[00:04:57] Causeway swirling all three of them
[00:04:58] elemental power
[00:05:04] I'll take a look
[00:05:06] I should be able to help if it's just
[00:05:11] [Music]
[00:05:14] a strange
[00:05:16] very strange
[00:05:18] this fungus didn't develop from a Spore
[00:05:21] it's an elemental life form
[00:05:24] huh an elemental life form
[00:05:28] yes
[00:05:29] although the fungi you normally see are
[00:05:32] capable of using elemental powers
[00:05:34] they're merely borrowing elemental power
[00:05:36] from nature around them as for this
[00:05:40] fungus
[00:05:41] it has elemental power flowing for fun
[00:05:44] definitely not anything like your
[00:05:46] tipping people hey Granny
[00:05:50] yeah exactly
[00:05:52] she thought I was leaving tomorrow
[00:05:54] because she knows I have to go pick up
[00:05:55] my passport but I'll link Sunday
[00:05:57] so this is the first event
[00:06:02] there's a large void within itself
[00:06:04] [Music]
[00:06:07] yeah no big deal normally let's follow
[00:06:10] you to learn
[00:06:12] so do you think it'll wake up if we can
[00:06:14] fill the void yeah no and I just so
[00:06:17] happen to be good at this sort of thing
[00:06:18] I'll see what I can do right
[00:06:26] what the [ __ ] is happening
[00:06:27] is she gonna arrest this guy
[00:06:34] Elemental being floaty hydrofungus dude
[00:06:37] why can't we still not have some in our
[00:06:38] teapot
[00:06:48] Bongo head can talk
[00:06:52] saved me
[00:06:54] thank you as well as the stranger and
[00:06:57] creature next to when my chair keeps
[00:06:59] falling shortening
[00:07:01] what the [ __ ] such a strange creature to
[00:07:05] make a sound like that
[00:07:07] seems I'm just as shocked as you are
[00:07:09] real dude pylons annoying a w
[00:07:14] itch
[00:07:15] I'm not yet able to evaluate an
[00:07:18] organism's intelligence from its
[00:07:20] appearance I will only know you were
[00:07:22] able to speak once you have spoken oh uh
[00:07:26] well
[00:07:28] but
[00:07:29] we look so dumb that people might think
[00:07:32] paiman doesn't know how to talk yes
[00:07:34] misunderstand come on
[00:07:37] eating breathing and other function s
[00:07:39] that are more important than speaking
[00:07:41] bum so a creature may not speak even if
[00:07:44] it has a mouth
[00:07:46] I've never seen a creature like you
[00:07:48] before so I dare not make the assumption
[00:07:51] that you could speak
[00:07:52] even if you do possess a number of human
[00:07:55] traits it is still very common for
[00:07:57] creatures to have since one kind of
[00:07:59] fungus talk
[00:08:02] fun to study at the Academia real sounds
[00:08:06] like I'll hide them
[00:08:11] correct
[00:08:13] oh
[00:08:17] oh
[00:08:20] he cloned a fungus he the fungus like I
[00:08:24] was the Torre all along and that appears
[00:08:26] and then you fight him
[00:08:31] [Music]
[00:08:33] it says that it's very thankful for you
[00:08:36] can you imagine that would be I should
[00:08:37] design a quest
[00:08:40] foreign
[00:08:43] I was confident that I knew of all the
[00:08:45] creatures into that even if there are
[00:08:48] ones I've never seen with my own eyes I
[00:08:50] thought I possessed all the relevance
[00:08:52] knowledge about them
[00:08:54] however even if I were to lay out the
[00:08:57] traits of all Elemental life forms you
[00:09:00] don't seem to match any of them
[00:09:02] what are you and where did you come it's
[00:09:05] Carrie Bear Aware come from an ancient
[00:09:07] race
[00:09:08] we have existed for a very long time
[00:09:11] possibly longer than any records in
[00:09:14] existence
[00:09:15] my home was filled with flowing water
[00:09:17] and great mountains very cool until the
[00:09:22] Apocalypse
[00:09:25] [Music]
[00:09:31] before there was the nuke
[00:09:34] twisting and no causing us to lose
[00:09:37] control we were victims of the
[00:09:40] Apocalypse the apocalypse is fake
[00:09:42] brother we also became the apocalypse
[00:09:45] you think those apocalypse than Iris in
[00:09:46] this game the apocalypse I'm not sure
[00:09:50] what it means either
[00:09:52] it sounds like some kind of old fable
[00:09:56] it's a long and complicated story it
[00:09:59] will take me some time to explain it
[00:10:01] clearly don't worry we'll listen
[00:10:04] I was lucky and managed to survive
[00:10:08] okay I left with some of my family and
[00:10:10] came to sumero to search for a way to
[00:10:13] rescue my homeland okay he came in
[00:10:15] contact with many species okay later
[00:10:17] found out that human power apocalypse
[00:10:19] for us Forbidden Knowledge wait for a
[00:10:22] bit of knowledge
[00:10:24] oh he's gonna say greater Lord Ruka
[00:10:26] Nevada
[00:10:27] oh no
[00:10:29] it said they are looking for a way to
[00:10:31] save their Homeland but the catastrophe
[00:10:33] of the desert should have ended a long
[00:10:35] time ago the Lord of dendro is correct
[00:10:38] we are not from the dead
[00:10:41] I would very much like to tell you the
[00:10:43] location of my homeland
[00:10:45] but unfortunately I've forgotten that
[00:10:48] may sound a little odd as it is very
[00:10:51] important to both me and my family but
[00:10:53] he just forgets uh did you forget
[00:10:57] I am a life form that was contaminated
[00:10:59] by the Apocalypse a part of my knowledge
[00:11:02] and memory was taken away as the
[00:11:04] contamination make a map
[00:11:08] I get it now
[00:11:11] take a picture the power was left behind
[00:11:13] from when the Forbidden Knowledge was
[00:11:15] purged
[00:11:17] I'm sorry
[00:11:23] that's okay
[00:11:24] Lord of dendro there is no need to
[00:11:26] apologize
[00:11:28] without your help I would have lost more
[00:11:30] than just my knowledge and a memory
[00:11:33] and not only did you save me but you've
[00:11:36] also already read the world of the
[00:11:38] remaining Forbidden Knowledge right
[00:11:40] that's right
[00:11:42] the forbidden knowledge is no more okay
[00:11:45] should be safe now
[00:11:48] we can go home
[00:11:50] for the longest time this moment has
[00:11:53] only seemed like why do I feel like it's
[00:11:54] not gonna be that simple to go home it
[00:11:56] would become a reality so quickly
[00:11:58] what I feel like he's not going home
[00:12:09] not your fault
[00:12:10] you've already done everything you can
[00:12:13] every species paid a grave price in the
[00:12:16] fight against forbidden knowledge
[00:12:18] this is not a responsibility you should
[00:12:21] carry on yeah as the channel let me
[00:12:22] pause this for a second as the chatter
[00:12:24] kindly pointed out in case anyone's new
[00:12:25] here and forgot like oh what is
[00:12:27] Forbidden Knowledge like I'm new to the
[00:12:28] gungeon lore it's a forbidden team comp
[00:12:30] that no one wants the theory crafts
[00:12:31] which is child Dory double dendro where
[00:12:33] you have the most Hydro the most Electro
[00:12:35] with dory's fast Electro application and
[00:12:37] then the double dendro to keep up said
[00:12:39] you're hyper blooming as much as
[00:12:40] possible it's the Forbidden theme comp
[00:12:42] and the reason why it's forbidden in
[00:12:43] knowledge is because no one wants to
[00:12:44] level Dory to 90 to test the team so
[00:12:46] it's forbidden
[00:12:49] it's secret meta it's the secret meta
[00:12:51] theme
[00:12:53] besides where are they
[00:12:55] maybe they'll remember
[00:13:00] real
[00:13:01] any of my family members have already
[00:13:03] met their end
[00:13:05] I'm not sure who else is still alive
[00:13:08] don't worry I should be able to find
[00:13:10] them
[00:13:11] just leave it to me thanks radish I'll
[00:13:13] leave the rainforest to the aranara and
[00:13:16] as for the city
[00:13:18] there were a few nice kids that should
[00:13:20] be willing to I think it should have
[00:13:22] been dude yeah
[00:13:23] the biggest crime of Genji like
[00:13:26] indention impact is the fact that the
[00:13:27] RNR request wasn't voice acted it does
[00:13:30] like the best Quest and I didn't want to
[00:13:32] listen to it because it wasn't voice
[00:13:33] acted
[00:13:40] like it's so hard to read everything I'm
[00:13:42] lazy
[00:13:43] it may take some time to find them so
[00:13:45] let's wait for a bit
[00:13:47] thank you Lord of tendro we all believe
[00:13:50] that you will keep your promises the
[00:13:53] moment I saw you when I awoke what's
[00:13:55] good I had a feeling you were here
[00:13:57] because of the agreement
[00:13:59] as soon as this cutscene's over I'm
[00:14:01] killing them for the maths just so you
[00:14:02] know those mats are [ __ ] impossible
[00:14:04] to get because every time it's like
[00:14:05] [ __ ] they got electrode for some
[00:14:07] reason
[00:14:09] General will bring us home it is what it
[00:14:11] is I'm sorry it is what it is

[00:15:27] wait where am I going
[00:15:30] forever
[00:15:31] have I even been here before I feel like

[00:16:06] nobody would want that
[00:16:14] stop typing yep you're hurting my
[00:16:15] feelings
[00:16:19] are you talking about your fuss
[00:16:26] I told you that the power in the crystal
[00:16:28] is very similar to mine I don't remember
[00:16:31] the elemental power inside the crystal
[00:16:34] is complete
[00:16:36] there's a connection between the Crystal
[00:16:38] and the fungus exactly
[00:16:41] the prophecy that it mentioned was
[00:16:43] probably an agreement that I made with
[00:16:45] an elemental life form that once
[00:16:47] represented its race wow I had to deal
[00:16:50] with the forbidden knowledge to save
[00:16:51] their Homeland
[00:16:53] the process however took away some oh
[00:16:56] let me let me Enlighten you on the
[00:16:57] memories you lost
[00:17:05] unable to tell us more
[00:17:09] yeah I've been trying to think of a
[00:17:12] place that fits the description of its
[00:17:14] Homeland
[00:17:15] but I'm unable to come up with anything
[00:17:18] we'll just continue to investigate I
[00:17:21] really want to send them home so they
[00:17:23] won't have to watch hey John I'm not
[00:17:24] gonna lie
[00:17:26] as much as I love nahida's charactered
[00:17:29] it like like in quests this is just
[00:17:31] people talk like I do not care about you
[00:17:33] that much slime I'm sorry I said I'm
[00:17:34] sorry like you're cute but like dude
[00:17:37] like hurry up tell the army

[00:17:46] sorry that was toxic I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:17:50] can I land it on his head
[00:17:54] our bondage
[00:18:03] busted
[00:18:08] on a burst
[00:18:13] I'm just gonna wait I don't care
[00:18:18] amazing
[00:18:20] with such skills you all would have
[00:18:22] definitely been able to find a way to
[00:18:24] survive the apocalypse
[00:18:26] hey
[00:18:28] I've been meaning to ask
[00:18:33] no we didn't
[00:18:39] after communicating with various living
[00:18:41] organisms in sumero okay I've discovered
[00:18:44] that fungi are the life form most
[00:18:46] adapted to live in these lands
[00:18:48] thus we gradually took the form of fungi
[00:18:51] and became a part of that group
[00:18:54] it's hard to believe that's even
[00:18:55] possible this is why streaming Quest is
[00:18:58] like weird for me because like is I
[00:19:00] don't want to talk over it but then when
[00:19:01] I don't talk it's like I'm just like
[00:19:03] here and then my whole chat ends up
[00:19:05] either like they're just like there's
[00:19:07] always like two Chatters talking about
[00:19:09] random shits don't they bust on me
[00:19:12] what are you typing and like since Chad
[00:19:14] is moving slower because we're like
[00:19:16] focused on the quest like what is
[00:19:18] happening like we can't even like drown
[00:19:19] it out like what the [ __ ]
[00:19:30] to blend with the environment and fend
[00:19:32] off Natural predators
[00:19:34] wow life forms one of the most ancient
[00:19:38] life forms in this land that's cool
[00:19:41] if timer wanted to hi Mom could change
[00:19:44] into a different form as well not as
[00:19:46] freely I'm afraid dumb you would require
[00:19:48] a lot you said you're useless
[00:19:51] although this is common sense to us
[00:19:53] it is still extremely difficult to
[00:19:56] explain
[00:19:58] putting it as simply as possible
[00:20:01] changing form requires energy and energy
[00:20:05] comes with time you cannot control grow
[00:20:08] into a giant tree instantly I see
[00:20:18] cross
[00:20:19] I see yes then this is what you would
[00:20:23] call growth
[00:20:27] okay
[00:20:28] cool
[00:20:31] how much farther is it
[00:20:34] we're about halfway there did I spent
[00:20:36] the whole Quest molding wait why do you
[00:20:39] need me
[00:20:45] also why is my cookie on fav
[00:20:54] others

[00:21:36] wait this is legit Curry Bear all over
[00:21:38] again oh no it's just a fungus I don't
[00:21:42] want my presence to change or affect the
[00:21:44] original state
[00:21:48] slightly different from an ordinary
[00:21:50] fungus
[00:21:52] seems to understand some human language
[00:21:54] I don't remember the last sentence I
[00:21:56] just said I just remember saying
[00:21:57] something but I don't remember what I
[00:21:58] said is this normal
[00:22:00] what is happening
[00:22:01] you know like Bongo head
[00:22:07] I think that name is foghat's a pretty
[00:22:09] good pretty good name
[00:22:23] I learned it from an adventurer it's
[00:22:26] oh Paul's chest its name Paul's chance
[00:22:29] sorry but I forgot you
[00:22:32] calm boss there is an apocalypse it's
[00:22:34] okay I forgot everything it's okay
[00:22:36] it's okay
[00:22:37] it's not your fault I must remember it
[00:22:39] before I return
[00:22:41] just as important
[00:22:49] yes dude Ray Rayo stop it
[00:22:53] I give you one job you're our local pet
[00:22:56] you can't be acting out a line
[00:22:59] stop asking to build physical eye
[00:23:03] you have one job
[00:23:11] [Music]
[00:23:14] I'm not going I have perception Skyward
[00:23:17] Atlas
[00:23:18] the withering
[00:23:20] yes I have heard humans also call it
[00:23:23] that before it's the last form we take
[00:23:26] when we are at the end of our life
[00:23:31] doesn't understand it's trying to say
[00:23:35] that when they've suffered enough and
[00:23:36] reached the end of their life
[00:23:38] they become a tumor of the weathering
[00:23:41] yes
[00:23:42] I've also suffered the same fate if it
[00:23:45] wasn't for the Lord of dendro's help
[00:23:48] oh
[00:23:49] this is
[00:23:52] wow
[00:23:54] reveal knowledge is the root cause of
[00:23:56] the withering but even it is the child
[00:23:58] dories him again
[00:24:03] which is why the withering remains
[00:24:06] remains disappeared
[00:24:08] they've been tormented by forbidden
[00:24:10] knowledge for a long time
[00:24:12] it's understandable that they will
[00:24:14] eventually become the withering but what
[00:24:16] is sad and pitiful end when I left my
[00:24:19] homeland
[00:24:20] flowers like these filled the fields
[00:24:23] each Bloom represented an individual
[00:24:26] life
[00:24:27] they grew in the pristine lakes in the
[00:24:30] fertile soil in my home and in the homes
[00:24:34] of my friends they grew everywhere
[00:24:38] until the world suddenly lost all its
[00:24:41] color and became tainted and murky but
[00:24:44] it's already no this guy is on a
[00:24:46] selective memory I'm gonna say it
[00:24:47] they're like oh I don't remember I don't
[00:24:49] remember but then they vividly describe
[00:24:51] everything that happened
[00:24:57] if I can sense the elemental power of my
[00:25:00] companions then I take them with me but
[00:25:03] that wasn't you the effects of forbidden
[00:25:05] knowledge could have it's okay that's
[00:25:09] not important anymore
[00:25:11] I just hope that they can all make it
[00:25:13] back home
[00:25:14] it's not right to leave them just simply
[00:25:16] perish in the open like this
[00:25:18] now that we finally have the chance to
[00:25:21] return home but I feel like there were
[00:25:22] not returning home this is like very
[00:25:24] cold not much happier
[00:25:26] I understand
[00:25:28] I got this so you're worried about me
[00:25:30] yes
[00:25:35] surely
[00:25:36] natural to want to be over
[00:25:40] surely
[00:25:42] all that's the skeleton there's nothing
[00:25:44] to worry about surely
[00:25:51] okay
[00:25:52] wait what area am I in I did 100 this
[00:25:55] okay
[00:26:02] I'm gonna try on the heater just lit
[00:26:04] busted
[00:26:14] is that it the [ __ ] is the rest oh I
[00:26:16] have to do the withering thing
[00:26:18] whoa withering Zone poggers
[00:26:22] that one
[00:26:24] is that one
[00:26:36] check her build
[00:26:39] or weapon oh it's not a signature
[00:26:43] signature weapon thousand floating
[00:26:45] dreams artifact for
[00:26:48] 105 em
[00:27:09] because that was one of my Chatters that
[00:27:12] would be a bad
[00:27:15] all good though
[00:27:17] I don't think you can check the
[00:27:18] individual artifacts for the people
[00:27:19] asking I don't think this works yeah
[00:27:23] [ __ ] Nobles
[00:27:28] did they could have given her instructor
[00:27:29] and it would have been based
[00:27:41] aware I'm just waiting for someone to

[00:27:46] literally waiting let me put it closer
[00:27:48] to me I'm literally waiting
[00:27:51] after just thinking about how many
[00:27:53] Elemental it's okay
[00:27:55] as long as elemental power still exists
[00:27:59] then we will still be around
[00:28:01] this journal form is but a gift of time
[00:28:05] through growth comes change and even
[00:28:08] abandonment of previous forms
[00:28:10] however our true nature is not so easily
[00:28:14] affected
[00:28:15] earlier
[00:28:19] but I will cure all of them
[00:28:22] even if it's just for the sake of the
[00:28:24] rainforest and all the life forms that
[00:28:26] live in it
[00:28:27] thank you Lord of dendro it was a wise
[00:28:30] choice for us to place our trust in you

[00:30:04] [ __ ] pretended to be nahida and then
[00:30:06] we're playing budget gentian that was my
[00:30:09] favorite part of any Quest but we don't
[00:30:11] have time for growth

[00:30:22] history

[00:30:37] you have great elemental power so you
[00:30:40] may be able to do it you will have to
[00:30:43] use power equal to that which is
[00:30:44] required to break through the
[00:30:46] limitations of time time I will lend you
[00:30:49] the relevant knowledge that I Dr Strange

[00:36:08] [Music]
[00:36:10] apocalypse ended
[00:36:12] go home now yes unfortunately I've
[00:36:17] forgotten where home is
[00:36:19] hoping you still remembered
[00:36:21] I
[00:36:22] I remember
[00:36:24] really
[00:36:29] the we not
[00:36:31] Central Dragon oh wait no that's the new
[00:36:33] weekly boss
[00:36:43] expressed such emotions before but yes
[00:36:46] our home is the dendro Dragon oh oh wait
[00:36:50] a minute Hyman's confused do you mean
[00:36:53] the dendro dragon as a yes they're both
[00:36:56] dragons but a pep Central dragon has
[00:36:59] been around for longer and has
[00:37:01] accumulated dense elemental power
[00:37:04] but I don't quite understand
[00:37:07] why would you say that your Homeland is
[00:37:10] a dragon
[00:37:11] cause we live inside the dendro dragon
[00:37:15] a pep that sounds like an acronym
[00:37:18] American
[00:37:20] Patriot
[00:37:27] [Music]
[00:37:28] Tire hell yeah brother
[00:37:31] the a pep
[00:37:39] once told us in a majestic voice
[00:37:41] Majestic dude I should put Majestic
[00:37:43] Steam on my [ __ ] soundboard and
[00:37:45] whenever I hear it I can I can that's a
[00:37:47] good idea let me open up the Majestic
[00:37:49] theme
[00:37:51] paganini's the greatest place there ever
[00:37:54] was before the apocalypse arrived
[00:37:58] still confused
[00:38:02] yes a very good example
[00:38:05] it appears that you're much smarter than
[00:38:07] by one the other difference is that the
[00:38:11] dendro Dragon yo what the time on
[00:38:13] catching Strays true though true wait
[00:38:17] then if that's his
[00:38:22] stop roasting Majestic no you need to
[00:38:24] suck my balls until I get common chest
[00:38:27] respawning I will never let it go look
[00:38:30] so worried
[00:38:31] roasting
[00:38:38] Heaven's world
[00:38:39] The Forbidden Knowledge should have
[00:38:41] become a part of its body a long time
[00:38:43] ago
[00:38:44] which means that if all the Forbidden
[00:38:47] Knowledge has been eliminated and a big
[00:38:50] void will also form inside the dragon
[00:38:52] I'm afraid so
[00:38:55] it's body and soul have probably been in
[00:38:57] terrible shape for some time now
[00:38:59] although the dental Dragon looks sad
[00:39:01] looks like the [ __ ] I'm not gonna say
[00:39:03] it but you know what I'm thinking
[00:39:07] was it due to the destruction of King
[00:39:09] desert civilization
[00:39:11] oh
[00:39:13] but anyway a pep disappeared question
[00:39:16] mark the [ __ ] I don't want to say it
[00:39:19] every time I say it I was like no why
[00:39:21] would you bring that up
[00:39:23] a while it's probably in pain as we
[00:39:25] speak
[00:39:26] the thing from [ __ ] Fullmetal
[00:39:28] Alchemist
[00:39:29] [Music]

[00:39:46] do it just does
[00:39:47] it does I will all be dispersed central
[00:39:50] elemental power of that concentration
[00:39:52] will cause the rainforest to overgrow
[00:39:55] giant trees will completely block out
[00:39:57] the sun it runs with these like povs
[00:40:01] Samira will no longer be suitable for
[00:40:04] sustaining life oh

[00:43:56] much we can do until we receive your

[00:44:00] your [ __ ] dumbass brother he's
[00:44:02] already turned into like evil King
[00:44:05] it and what does it have to do with King
[00:44:07] deshred well the history of dragons
[00:44:11] starts from respectfully though
[00:44:13] respectfully
[00:44:15] the Mary Elizabeth's territory in those
[00:44:18] days the Lush rainforest covered the
[00:44:21] entire nation
[00:44:22] oh so there was no desert back then not
[00:44:25] at first
[00:44:26] that came when the giant Spike fell from
[00:44:29] the sky turning a huge section of the
[00:44:31] rainforest into sand in an attempt to
[00:44:34] adapt to its new environment a pep
[00:44:36] changed color from the emerald green of
[00:44:38] the forest to the yellow of the sand I'm
[00:44:41] gonna say the cafe until my level
[00:44:43] triangle go away sibling the importance
[00:44:46] of
[00:44:55] even now it probably still holds great
[00:44:59] hostility toward the Gods
[00:45:01] however powerless against the power in
[00:45:04] the sky and then the Forbidden Knowledge
[00:45:06] many Millennia leader it's been unable
[00:45:09] to stir up in I thought the gods and
[00:45:11] Dragons were on good terms between the
[00:45:12] two sides are destined to continue until
[00:45:15] a balance can be found
[00:45:16] as far as I know a pep had been
[00:45:19] slumbering in the desert and King desert
[00:45:22] happened in a great interest
[00:45:25] was contaminated
[00:45:27] I'm not sure what may have led it to
[00:45:29] become involved but rescuing it is
[00:45:32] definitely our top priority right now
[00:45:34] the crystal that I have in my position
[00:45:38] okay
[00:45:39] all right
[00:45:49] what is happening anymore I don't know
[00:45:52] look I just need to kill something
[00:45:54] my brain I need to I need to Monkey GO
[00:45:57] smash
[00:46:13] [Music]
[00:46:21] um
[00:46:22] yeah what the [ __ ] I'm on family's
[00:46:25] family cares about the species
[00:46:28] one doesn't quite understand we're all
[00:46:30] fun guys trying to say
[00:46:34] yeah [ __ ] you come on
[00:46:39] but we do not
[00:46:41] we find the experience dude can you
[00:46:44] imagine how gen should impact would be
[00:46:45] like the number one selling game if at
[00:46:48] they made a whole Quest like this
[00:46:50] centered around family and at the end
[00:46:52] the final boss of family Vin Diesel
[00:46:55] shows up and then saves the day and you
[00:46:56] can pull for him on the Vin Diesel
[00:46:58] Banner
[00:47:07] the essence of what it means to grow
[00:47:13] and get sick now looks can always change
[00:47:16] so what's inside of us is more important
[00:47:19] kind of wants to follow you around
[00:47:22] wait
[00:47:23] oh
[00:47:26] understood thank you oh
[00:47:29] what did the RNR say still nothing new
[00:47:31] from the store seems like we won't be
[00:47:34] able to find your other family members
[00:47:35] for now unlucky it appears we are all
[00:47:38] the fleets to follow and if no one knows
[00:47:41] how this Crystal works then the pep may
[00:47:43] be in danger a pep it's okay it isn't
[00:47:46] your fault
[00:47:47] I don't think it's a coincidence that
[00:47:50] neither of you can remember anything
[00:47:51] about the crystal
[00:47:53] s the final boss in conoria you'll see
[00:47:57] which causes
[00:48:00] my mom is an evil drone
[00:48:02] spying on us
[00:48:04] at all
[00:48:05] [Music]
[00:48:07] the Crystal and the Apocalypse
[00:48:09] apocalypse and memories
[00:48:12] Lord of dendro do you still remember the
[00:48:15] prophecy I do that's about it
[00:48:20] the prophecy is a story that connects
[00:48:22] events of the past and the future
[00:48:24] okay a family member once said that the
[00:48:27] apocalypse is a part of us
[00:48:29] there is value in preserving it okay the
[00:48:32] rest of the family did not approve of
[00:48:34] its opinion at the time
[00:48:36] so it left boom preserving the
[00:48:38] Apocalypse
[00:48:39] do you mean that there's still some that
[00:48:42] hasn't been eliminated
[00:48:43] that's not very likely the power of
[00:48:46] Urban Soul covers every inch of the land
[00:48:49] did the prophecy say where that family
[00:48:51] member went
[00:48:54] steps east of sumero a murky place that
[00:48:58] no one can return from yeah
[00:49:01] nothing right oh yeah I explored the
[00:49:04] chasm I remember that that was cool
[00:49:07] it's impossible to preserve forbidden
[00:49:10] knowledge but
[00:49:12] what if it can be converted to a
[00:49:14] different form I'm sorry if I'm suddenly
[00:49:17] not making any sense
[00:49:18] however I do think it's possible
[00:49:22] [Music]
[00:49:25] Google Translate
[00:49:31] wait I was kidding about not doing the
[00:49:33] chasm
[00:49:42] wait no I can do it I can do it I can do
[00:49:44] it I can do it right surely surely I can
[00:49:46] do it right
[00:49:47] surely I can still do it it surely it
[00:49:49] was just like a suggestion surely I can
[00:49:52] do it right
[00:49:54] yeah I have the waypoints really that's
[00:49:55] it truly that's it that's it
[00:49:57] dude I was joking about not exploring
[00:50:01] the chasm see I got it I remember when
[00:50:03] Dane's leaves half dead you know
[00:50:04] remember half then the Giga yeah I
[00:50:06] remember
[00:50:08] I remember
[00:50:14] so that Elemental life form came all the
[00:50:17] way here on its own and spent a long
[00:50:18] time by itself wouldn't it already have
[00:50:21] become the withering like the others
[00:50:24] there is a chance that they could avoid
[00:50:26] that end using the powers
[00:50:29] are all for the quest but I appreciate
[00:50:32] the abyss
[00:50:33] it once repaired the Rifts of tavat long
[00:50:35] ago
[00:50:36] it has the ability to purify and
[00:50:39] stabilize powers that shouldn't exist
[00:50:40] into that forbidden knowledge that its
[00:50:43] life has shown upon is kept here forever
[00:50:45] in a different form
[00:50:49] you mean the oozing of Filth it's just
[00:50:51] like
[00:50:52] just like rise to the
[00:50:54] one
[00:50:58] and that's what the apocalypse was
[00:51:00] altered by the power of the giant Spike
[00:51:02] yes and it shouldn't be far from here
[00:51:05] let's go take a look wow no you know you
[00:51:07] sounded so like realistic in that last
[00:51:09] line yeah I'm no big deal I'm a voice
[00:51:11] actor
[00:51:12] vocal artist
[00:51:17] [Music]
[00:51:24] are they calling it spike is that a nail
[00:51:25] now
[00:51:27] that's a good question
[00:51:29] [Music]
[00:51:32] I like waiting for five seconds are we
[00:51:34] in the chasm now I don't [ __ ] know
[00:51:35] we're just we're following nahida and
[00:51:37] Bongo head
[00:51:44] they never refer to it as nail in the
[00:51:46] game before
[00:51:47] mostly there you go oh Spike from
[00:51:49] valerians
[00:51:52] oh
[00:51:54] first there was jet from Valor now
[00:51:57] there's the spike too
[00:52:00] should be able to take care of it right
[00:52:02] wait the song's a banger is this the
[00:52:03] chasm combat theme I Loki I've never
[00:52:05] heard this in my life
[00:52:08] is this the chasm theme they're just
[00:52:10] banging
[00:52:14] [Music]
[00:52:21] wait what's happening what is this
[00:52:30] Gadget
[00:52:36] oh the chasm Gadget there's a Chasm
[00:52:38] Gadget I know about it I know about it
[00:52:39] uh uh
[00:52:43] oh that was easy
[00:52:45] I don't know what the [ __ ] that Gadget
[00:52:46] does but it worked
[00:52:47] oh he's dead should be the life one
[00:52:50] prophecy
[00:52:51] oh nice job never mind
[00:52:54] level four I can't well that's max level
[00:52:56] that's max level have you seen my crit
[00:52:58] value have you seen my artifacts surely
[00:53:00] that I'm like max level I'm an endgame
[00:53:01] player ar-60
[00:53:07] to say it was purified maybe it's
[00:53:10] because such a long amount of time
[00:53:13] although the power of the using itself
[00:53:15] is more stable than that of the
[00:53:17] Apocalypse it is still a form of
[00:53:20] Dangerous Power
[00:53:21] it might have lost its mind after being
[00:53:24] soaked in it once I caught sir I don't
[00:53:26] interrupt the quest I just have to ban
[00:53:27] someone really fast let me pause it
[00:53:34] where is it
[00:53:36] uh I've been playing for a month how is
[00:53:38] mine higher level okay let me just
[00:53:43] some time out
[00:53:46] I should be able to purge it with my
[00:53:48] elemental power wait don't do it this is
[00:53:51] our only chance there's forbidden
[00:53:52] knowledge in there it's gonna be child
[00:53:54] Dory careful
[00:53:59] uh oh
[00:54:07] I trust your judgment
[00:54:09] I was being a little Hasty myself
[00:54:13] imagine she does it and then we wake up
[00:54:16] beep
[00:54:18] oh yeah you said that the elemental
[00:54:21] power in the Crystal was identical to
[00:54:24] theirs
[00:54:26] you want to use its power but
[00:54:30] the Lord of dendro seems hesitant I too
[00:54:34] would advise caution it's risky to use
[00:54:37] its power without fully understanding
[00:54:39] its intended use
[00:54:43] yes I understand but this is our own
[00:54:47] chance to return home true it's okay
[00:54:50] there's no need to argue
[00:54:52] I'll think of something to do about the
[00:54:54] elemental power that will be used
[00:54:57] hmm
[00:54:58] how about this
[00:55:00] traveler you could try using it oh cause
[00:55:03] we're dangerous Travelers and it's
[00:55:05] dendro the amazing resistance yeah sure
[00:55:08] thing
[00:55:08] color
[00:55:12] while skipping a Nemo fungus dialogue
[00:55:14] I'm reading it it just talks slow I'm
[00:55:16] sorry
[00:55:18] boss champ cutscene
[00:55:23] what the
[00:55:33] Lord of dendro and you others how long
[00:55:37] how long have I been waiting here
[00:55:40] sounds like a Chad I'm not gonna lie oh
[00:55:42] I skipped up
[00:55:43] wait did I skip I don't know
[00:55:46] neutral person
[00:55:48] does that mean
[00:55:50] the apocalypse has come to an end
[00:55:53] wait did you get smaller again
[00:55:57] I'm sorry that portion of my memory is
[00:56:00] highly unreliable at the moment
[00:56:03] can't seem to remember who you are
[00:56:06] that sounds about right
[00:56:08] after all the purpose of my existence is
[00:56:11] precisely for those unreliable memories
[00:56:14] you speak of
[00:56:16] that the apocalypse will be completely
[00:56:19] eradicated and that relevant memories
[00:56:22] will become unstable uh oh and you
[00:56:25] couldn't promise that you'd remember our
[00:56:27] agreement have however you are
[00:56:29] definitely someone who stays true to
[00:56:32] your word my sacrifices you guys how it
[00:56:34] looks tasty looks like a portobello
[00:56:37] mushroom yes you use your power to
[00:56:40] protect me
[00:56:45] to be honest I'm rearing my end I had
[00:56:49] thought I'd be stronger than this no no
[00:56:52] one can withstand the power
[00:56:55] to preserve a somewhat stable memory I
[00:56:59] had to change the power of the
[00:57:01] Apocalypse into a different form
[00:57:04] only the giant Spike that fell from the
[00:57:07] sky was capable of doing something like
[00:57:10] that
[00:57:11] but the moment I chose to go through
[00:57:13] with it because the moment I lost my
[00:57:17] chance of being rescued by the Lord of
[00:57:19] dendro
[00:57:21] but enough about me
[00:57:23] lord of the intro let's get to the
[00:57:25] important batter at hand
[00:57:27] as you can see
[00:57:29] I won't last much longer
[00:57:32] I understand and I'm sorry but
[00:57:37] can you please
[00:57:41] this is a fire seed
[00:57:44] it's an essential item for saving the
[00:57:46] dendro dragon
[00:57:48] thankfully it appears to be in good
[00:57:50] condition the Lord of dendro when our
[00:57:54] people created this item together it
[00:57:57] mimics how the dendro dragons heart of
[00:58:00] Oasis operates
[00:58:02] the dendro dragon has been tormented by
[00:58:05] the apocalypse for far too long yeah who
[00:58:09] is nearing the end of its power
[00:58:11] however if you are able to reactivate
[00:58:14] his heart of Oasis but the heel of the
[00:58:17] dendro Dragon then the dendro Dragon
[00:58:19] will be on my way up
[00:58:22] our homeland will return to the way it
[00:58:25] once was oh
[00:58:28] I saw the heart of Oasis is a pep source
[00:58:31] of power
[00:58:33] power I know what I must do is able to
[00:58:35] heal this fungus now that's what it's
[00:58:38] used for
[00:58:39] what you used the fire seat to save me
[00:58:46] why what's wrong
[00:58:49] wait is he not dying but never mind it's
[00:58:52] not your fault oh you didn't know
[00:58:54] the fire scene contains a high
[00:58:56] concentration of elemental power inside
[00:58:59] of it it's very powerful yet fragile at
[00:59:03] the same time
[00:59:04] it is not stable in its current form to
[00:59:08] prevent any uh oh please don't use it
[00:59:10] again
[00:59:12] I am its creator I
[00:59:16] assure you there's no need to worry
[00:59:19] all right
[00:59:20] aside from being able to heal the dendro
[00:59:23] Dragon the fire seed can also resonate
[00:59:26] with the heart of Oasis or in other
[00:59:29] words you'll be able to find the dendro
[00:59:32] dragon by following the guidance of the
[00:59:35] Fire Seed okay but you should hurry
[00:59:37] there is little time yes sir forget
[00:59:40] about me
[00:59:41] you shouldn't be home now everyone is
[00:59:45] returning home including you yeah come
[00:59:47] with us I told you I've already lost my
[00:59:50] chance to be saved by the Lord of dendro
[00:59:53] lord of the intro I thank you for coming
[00:59:57] to find me and for being willing to save
[01:00:00] the dendro dragon
[01:00:02] our past has been saved and not the
[01:00:06] father
[01:00:07] has been insured okay it's enough for me
[01:00:12] I see about the Lament
[01:00:19] um
[01:00:24] once more
[01:00:26] now feel its elemental power

[01:04:33] that I am
[01:04:35] time will bring death to all it's
[01:04:37] unavoidable
[01:04:39] although I am bravely ill my mind
[01:04:42] remains clear what's about to happen
[01:04:45] I am different from the ancient dragons
[01:04:47] that came to terms with you
[01:04:55] [Music]
[01:04:57] the show final formula this is a shot
[01:04:59] with friendship 10. C6 the shackles that
[01:05:03] the god of wisdom
[01:05:07] I have paid
[01:05:10] and you shall do the same soon enough
[01:05:18] oh
[01:05:20] [ __ ] is that
[01:05:23] it's oh never mind
[01:05:25] that was kind of toxic my bad
[01:05:27] I was out of pocket my bad
[01:05:33] [Music]
[01:05:36] um
[01:05:40] in other words their residents
[01:05:44] and stuff is this what they've become
[01:05:46] After experiencing the Apocalypse
[01:05:48] this is also a form of adaptation
[01:05:55] family member
[01:05:56] made it out of the Denver Dragon they've
[01:06:00] gradually taken this form in order to
[01:06:02] survive the apocalypse
[01:06:04] is there any way to avoid fighting them
[01:06:09] I rescue you
[01:06:12] last shot come on
[01:06:17] um they're not responding
[01:06:19] they left you on red
[01:06:22] they're being drawn by the fire seed
[01:06:25] only its power can temporarily free them
[01:06:28] from their pain
[01:06:29] All That Remains are the instincts to
[01:06:31] survive and search for energy needed to
[01:06:34] do so
[01:06:35] everything else has been discarded in
[01:06:37] the process of adaptation
[01:06:39] so this is the result of forbidden
[01:06:42] knowledge
[01:06:43] with our world become the same if
[01:06:45] Forbidden Knowledge was allowed to
[01:06:46] Rampage across to that
[01:06:48] like fish struggling on land well unable
[01:06:51] to find a single puddle of fresh water
[01:06:53] in the entire world now you know one
[01:06:56] more analogy and
[01:06:58] yes
[01:06:59] try to be gentle with them they are not
[01:07:03] evil in nature all they want to do is
[01:07:05] survive like a moon in the lab
[01:07:08] like lab rats in a maze wait we have to
[01:07:11] fight them yo that's [ __ ] up
[01:07:16] did he just eat his friend
[01:07:21] yo what the [ __ ]
[01:07:26] busted
[01:07:30] don't hurt them I have to oh did I that
[01:07:34] was a bit too fast
[01:07:36] I'm sorry
[01:07:43] no not that they're not dead yeah they
[01:07:44] want to go home but not dead
[01:07:47] dragon
[01:07:52] way to make them revert to their
[01:07:57] to their current state
[01:07:59] it seems only the fire seed or a peps
[01:08:01] heart of Oasis can save them but it'll
[01:08:04] be risky if we use the Fire Seed again
[01:08:07] correct we cannot use the Fire Seed
[01:08:10] again
[01:08:11] everyone goes home not just us
[01:08:17] uh
[01:08:20] you'll be fine
[01:08:22] surely
[01:08:25] okay
[01:08:30] don't forget she's watching the stream

[01:08:33] second so she could boot up the stream

[01:08:42] responsibility for whatever happens oh
[01:08:46] that's not good
[01:08:48] I feel like they're like foreshadowing a
[01:08:51] terrible situations
[01:08:53] I'm just worried that it'll become
[01:08:55] unstable but as long as I use my
[01:08:57] elemental power to stabilize it a little
[01:08:59] it shouldn't be a problem

[01:12:42] yeah I I lit up his fire from all right
[01:12:44] you can go chill I'll keep him warm
[01:12:50] yeah speaking
[01:12:55] of the chest in the Subaru like like
[01:12:57] Palace whatever it's called where
[01:12:58] there's just like a dude a scholar is
[01:13:00] like saving a bunch of Mora and then you
[01:13:02] just take it he's like oh these are my
[01:13:04] funds for when I'm done studying and
[01:13:05] then if you go there's like a chest with
[01:13:06] 100K Mora yeah I remember that's [ __ ]
[01:13:09] up
[01:13:10] by the way if you didn't claim that
[01:13:11] there's like free Mora waiting for you
[01:13:12] true
[01:13:15] yeah
[01:13:16] who knows what's inside that cave our
[01:13:19] goal is not only to find the dragon but
[01:13:22] to also enter the world inside of it
[01:13:24] that will be impossible if we can't get
[01:13:26] it to cooperate with us but how
[01:13:29] to do that it doesn't seem to want to
[01:13:31] help at all where's like behind the
[01:13:34] staircase in the Academia or some [ __ ]
[01:13:37] it's in the Academia and that we have a
[01:13:39] very different standing of the world and
[01:13:41] its orders
[01:13:42] however we are both born developmental
[01:13:45] power and both suffered the torment of
[01:13:47] forbidden knowledge
[01:13:49] we're not that different and right now
[01:13:52] we share a common enemy we should not
[01:13:54] let our differences get in the way
[01:13:56] hmm
[01:13:58] I wonder if the dendro dragons even
[01:14:00] willing to listen
[01:14:01] I don't care about what you believe in
[01:14:03] who you hate or what you've done in the
[01:14:06] video that's pretty noble nor do I
[01:14:08] expect you to be grateful
[01:14:10] I'm here to save both you and your
[01:14:12] people my people
[01:14:16] they've been searching for a way to save
[01:14:18] you ever since they left their Homeland
[01:14:20] they hear him for a chance to return
[01:14:22] home
[01:14:24] is over all the hatred that you Harbor
[01:14:27] has lost its meaning
[01:14:28] rather than continuing to fight the guys
[01:14:31] have my dad chat
[01:14:33] [Music]
[01:14:35] wait why is it just void response
[01:14:40] survive means that you haven't given up
[01:14:42] on that world yet
[01:14:44] if you claim to know so much more than I
[01:14:46] then why don't you truly think about why
[01:14:48] you want to survive yeah why you're so
[01:14:50] vengeful
[01:14:52] no he is getting ignored
[01:14:55] badge you [ __ ] donut world still no
[01:14:58] good oh never mind
[01:15:00] [Music]
[01:15:04] the Homeland
[01:15:08] um what the [ __ ] is the Homeland
[01:15:11] uh oh
[01:15:13] oh what's about to happen
[01:15:18] um
[01:15:20] where are we
[01:15:22] huh what about the traffic
[01:15:27] I was only able to ensure that we made
[01:15:30] it here safely
[01:15:32] it's possible we arrived at different
[01:15:34] locations
[01:15:37] well then let's go ahead look up ahead
[01:15:40] my mom's feeling really worried yep
[01:15:43] let's go
[01:15:44] I wouldn't worry too much if we play as
[01:15:46] time on I'm
[01:15:48] installing my
[01:15:51] mind hurry she might be just please let
[01:15:54] me be traveler please let me be me
[01:15:55] please please
[01:15:57] we're fine
[01:15:59] and I wish F3 no nothing works Escape
[01:16:04] but I was like alt f4
[01:16:16] I can't even jump
[01:16:31] what I feel like something's about to
[01:16:33] happen
[01:16:38] should be the heart of oasis
[01:16:41] all we need to do is slide it with the
[01:16:43] fire seed and it'll restore a pep with
[01:16:45] elemental power
[01:16:47] the damage it suffered internally will
[01:16:49] also slowly begin to heal
[01:16:52] then let's try let's hurry and light it
[01:16:53] we still need to find The Traveler
[01:16:56] all right hang on
[01:17:04] feed what happened what's happening
[01:17:16] I'm not sure
[01:17:18] perhaps the fire seat was only capable
[01:17:20] of protecting one person but if I didn't
[01:17:23] use his power in everyone there's no way
[01:17:25] of knowing where you could have been
[01:17:27] sucked into and even if that's the case
[01:17:31] there's no reason for it to Simply
[01:17:32] shatter unless
[01:17:35] wait
[01:17:37] unless I was already in a weakened State
[01:17:39] when they created this fire seed which
[01:17:42] would be when we at first saved the
[01:17:43] desert oh no
[01:17:47] wait let's put that aside aside for a
[01:17:50] moment
[01:17:53] all this way for nothing
[01:17:56] do you know what we should do now Nikita
[01:17:59] oh come on pymon pink I
[01:18:05] don't worry pymon
[01:18:07] this is my responsibility
[01:18:10] the fire seed is technically just a ball
[01:18:12] of highly concentrated elemental power
[01:18:15] although my elemental power is slightly
[01:18:18] different than that of Elemental life
[01:18:19] forms
[01:18:20] I gained a better understanding of it
[01:18:23] when I turned into a fungus
[01:18:25] so all I have to do is imitate that
[01:18:28] power while adding some of my own
[01:18:31] and I'll be able to do what the Fire
[01:18:33] Seed was supposed to
[01:18:35] You're Gonna become the Fire Seed girls
[01:18:39] nahida okay yes
[01:18:41] it'll take a lot of power from me
[01:18:46] when I was in the desert
[01:18:48] I might however
[01:18:51] become even smaller
[01:18:55] getting smaller
[01:18:58] I'll become a blade of grass or a twig
[01:19:01] basically our return to Holly was first
[01:19:04] born
[01:19:05] I will be able to unleash power beyond
[01:19:08] my limits if I can reverse the process
[01:19:10] of growth
[01:19:11] what yo it's not worth it [ __ ] these
[01:19:13] mushrooms you'll not only lose your
[01:19:16] appearance dude not again it's not worth
[01:19:18] it it's the second time who knows
[01:19:22] that's all right
[01:19:23] none of that matters compared to the
[01:19:26] dangers that a pep is facing right now
[01:19:29] there has to be another way no it's not
[01:19:32] worth it
[01:19:35] maybe you and the traveler can plant me
[01:19:37] in the soil of Samaria Nora oh my God
[01:19:41] the forest remembers
[01:19:44] it's just that you won't be able to see
[01:19:46] dude [ __ ] that dumbass Dragon you can't
[01:19:48] be
[01:19:50] I'll just burn them with [ __ ] Daya
[01:19:57] take responsibility that we never would
[01:20:00] have agreed in the first place
[01:20:02] I'm sorry pymon but we're out of options
[01:20:07] well actually no way this happens though
[01:20:09] actor a few something's gonna happen no
[01:20:11] way they're not killing the heater the
[01:20:13] risks are taken then the ego will be
[01:20:15] grounded forever
[01:20:19] [Music]
[01:20:32] huh
[01:20:36] the Fire Seed shattered
[01:20:40] I know My Sacrifice must be made but not
[01:20:45] by the Lord of General oh that makes
[01:20:47] sense
[01:20:57] then our wishes have come true oh
[01:21:05] [Music]
[01:21:07] would you lend us your power
[01:21:13] you knew it would come to this all the
[01:21:16] knowledge
[01:21:17] and emotions that you have learned

[01:21:33] is that truly the return you've always

[01:24:31] trying to tell me
[01:24:36] sorry
[01:24:44] I know you're sad
[01:24:50] articles was Saturday because then the
[01:24:51] rnrs all started singing
[01:24:55] I'll shut up okay the Guardians that
[01:24:58] have accompanied me for countless errors
[01:25:00] have also transformed into my elemental
[01:25:03] power
[01:25:04] just as they did
[01:25:08] they will be born once again now that
[01:25:11] they're one
[01:25:12] there's nothing to be sad about
[01:25:16] but that's different
[01:25:20] we will never have to skip I'm on it
[01:25:22] will never understand us
[01:25:24] that's how it's destined to be but as

[01:25:32] s Samara will be free from threat as
[01:25:34] long as your health is maintained
[01:25:37] I thought that my rage would be kindled
[01:25:39] once my power returned to me
[01:25:43] however what I feel now is a feeling
[01:25:46] that has long eluded me
[01:25:49] the feeling of peace
[01:25:53] The Forbidden Knowledge influenced you
[01:25:55] ever since you were contaminated greatly
[01:25:58] amplifying your hatred and rage
[01:26:00] yes
[01:26:01] there's no denying that
[01:26:03] that although my hatred for that usurper
[01:26:06] from Beyond the heavens
[01:26:09] not even a word destroying you and your
[01:26:12] people serves me no I'm wondering that
[01:26:16] my bad be that as it may my position
[01:26:19] still stands and I will have nothing to
[01:26:23] do with you
[01:26:26] when you inevitably perish due to your
[01:26:29] ever expanding curiosity
[01:26:31] I was still smear and muck you in my
[01:26:35] heart
[01:26:39] it's kind of [ __ ] up why do you say
[01:26:41] that your decision
[01:26:42] time I will prove to you that we will
[01:26:45] not repeat our mistakes yeah freak you
[01:26:47] begin resting there is one last thing I
[01:26:51] would like to know
[01:26:52] he'd all tried to kill herself to save
[01:26:54] people mushrooms
[01:26:56] it's a long story
[01:26:59] we are once believed in the distant past
[01:27:02] that only Forbidden Knowledge could give
[01:27:04] us enough power to defeat the Heavenly
[01:27:07] prison yeah and you were foolish why are
[01:27:09] you taking out your anger on the little
[01:27:10] radish choir
[01:27:13] from outside of this
[01:27:22] World Dragon King an unimaginable War
[01:27:27] took place into that
[01:27:29] causing destruction on an unprecedented
[01:27:31] yeah who's niba long the world itself
[01:27:34] was on the verge of collapse they name
[01:27:36] dropped them
[01:27:38] in war
[01:27:39] the Victor would inherit the right to
[01:27:41] shape the world
[01:27:43] while the losers must turn into Ash
[01:27:48] but I didn't give up on searching for a
[01:27:50] way to turn the tides
[01:27:52] even after the death of the Dragon King
[01:27:57] as I attempted to collect more Forbidden
[01:28:00] Knowledge from the corners of the world
[01:28:03] as I was on the verge of collapse
[01:28:05] I was stopped by the giant Spike that
[01:28:08] fell from the sky
[01:28:11] sand dunes arose where there was only a
[01:28:14] forest bomb and it was as if even sumero
[01:28:17] itself was trying to tell me that the
[01:28:21] era of the Dragons was over
[01:28:24] but you still didn't give up did you
[01:28:27] because of almond
[01:28:29] [Music]
[01:28:31] yes
[01:28:34] the goddess of flowers
[01:28:39] his Ambitions continue to grow and he
[01:28:43] planned to establish a powerful Kingdom
[01:28:45] in my domain
[01:28:48] although I didn't think much of him I
[01:28:51] allowed his actions under one condition
[01:28:55] [Music]
[01:28:57] the condition was that after his death
[01:28:59] all the knowledge he came to accumulate
[01:29:02] would belong to me
[01:29:06] at that time I still Harbor deep regrets
[01:29:11] by the time the Dragon King finally
[01:29:13] returned
[01:29:14] the world had irrevocably changed
[01:29:19] it's pronounced irrevocably but no big
[01:29:21] deal oh good oh it's fine oh and have
[01:29:23] forgotten all about our
[01:29:25] switch from when the world was taken
[01:29:27] from
[01:29:29] it and some died
[01:29:32] leaving behind nothing but their bones
[01:29:36] While others chose to flee After
[01:29:38] experiencing pain
[01:29:40] um
[01:29:43] but for me
[01:29:46] scales and will of the Dragon cave still
[01:29:49] shine bright in my heart
[01:29:51] I'll be honest
[01:29:53] ah don't care to ask ratio it's fine
[01:29:55] though it's all good let me go the end
[01:29:57] of
[01:30:01] [Music]
[01:30:10] I swallowed him whole as I agreed
[01:30:13] dude what are you doing
[01:30:18] I gained the Apocalypse
[01:30:23] I used up all my strength just trying to
[01:30:25] keep the pain under control
[01:30:28] I had no energy to analyze the knowledge
[01:30:31] he had accumulated
[01:30:34] but even then I still believe that his
[01:30:38] Insanity was far greater than that of my
[01:30:42] own so that's how the apocalypse started
[01:30:45] boom I admit that I fell for his truck
[01:30:49] I was like a final Fail Safe in His
[01:30:51] place then [ __ ] these dragons
[01:30:54] tiny booer
[01:30:56] and the rest of you
[01:30:58] continue forward
[01:31:00] I shall keep a watchful eye
[01:31:04] how far were the life so dear and
[01:31:07] precious to the Heavenly principles be
[01:31:10] able to go
[01:31:12] I wonder
[01:31:15] so Ryden already killed her as based
[01:31:22] [ __ ] you a pep and the other dragon
[01:31:26] and King deshard because why not
[01:31:29] honestly [ __ ] everyone that's not an
[01:31:31] oranara the dragon will need to
[01:31:37] need to run out as ruthless as it was
[01:31:39] before
[01:31:40] hearing the dragon of its illness has
[01:31:42] seemingly made it more open to reason
[01:31:44] nobody's in a good mood when they're
[01:31:46] feeling sick even though we accomplished
[01:31:48] something really important
[01:31:50] still doesn't feel happy yeah cause all
[01:31:53] the mushrooms are [ __ ] dead
[01:31:55] they're turned into Forest
[01:31:57] indeed
[01:31:59] although still have the chance to be
[01:32:01] born again
[01:32:02] lost their memories of their journey and
[01:32:05] their feelings for their Homeland
[01:32:07] each opportunity for growth is unique in
[01:32:09] its own way
[01:32:11] perhaps the immense power we released
[01:32:13] was the pouring out of all these
[01:32:15] Irreplaceable emotions that had built up
[01:32:17] over time
[01:32:18] can you really call A Place With No
[01:32:21] family or home this is literally
[01:32:23] building up for the Vin Diesel reveal
