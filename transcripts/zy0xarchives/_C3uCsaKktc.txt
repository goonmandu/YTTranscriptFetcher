[00:16:18] look at the rules in
[00:16:23] advance they should appear somewhere
[00:16:27] soon
[00:16:34] okay so of course while we prepare the
[00:16:37] rules we have the contestants getting
[00:16:39] ready up on stage we have once again for
[00:16:42] team my neglected children we have Team
[00:16:47] Jake AKA Tanto and also team or rather
[00:16:52] contestant zionic AKA Nick and we also
[00:16:55] he's very short and on the other team we
[00:16:57] have
[00:16:59] we have the wonderful atus unpaid
[00:17:03] employees AKA Dawn SL psycho and we also
[00:17:08] have fob AKA fob Master mhm also I again
[00:17:13] I am seeing a trend here I feel like you
[00:17:16] know if this was if we were to use a gin
[00:17:18] analogy I feel like you are the main
[00:17:21] character and I am the player and this
[00:17:24] is a Canon event and I cannot
[00:17:26] interfere fair enough we have some very
[00:17:28] Charming photos of Tonto and Z xxxxx
[00:17:33] there handsome his favorite sh below him
[00:17:36] they're all adventur rang 60 well they
[00:17:39] say achievements unkknown but the
[00:17:41] reality is they have no achievements but
[00:17:43] today maybe they will be able to achieve
[00:17:45] something absolutely spectacular and
[00:17:47] show you guys watching at home and
[00:17:49] watching live from twitchcon something
[00:17:51] very very special mhm that's right and
[00:17:55] then we also have the one and only B fox
[00:17:59] fox who is Adventure rank Unown so a
[00:18:05] very very mysterious genon
[00:18:08] player indeed and then on the other team
[00:18:12] we have of course psycho and fob so we
[00:18:16] have Dawn looking absolutely Splendid
[00:18:19] with the cosplay there we have fob
[00:18:21] looking very oooo very Kawaii with his
[00:18:24] favorite characters you can see daor and
[00:18:26] fb's favorite characters there you we
[00:18:30] have I think I'm also seeing another
[00:18:33] Trend here we have diona lyette and we
[00:18:36] also have Kirara for Dawn psyo all the
[00:18:39] cat girls all the cat girls and we also
[00:18:42] have for f we've got kaching guu and
[00:18:45] milu very very very nice looking wus
[00:18:48] some of my favorites as well and then on
[00:18:55] this and yeah so again none of these
[00:18:59] people have any achievements it says
[00:19:01] unknown but the reality is they do not
[00:19:02] have any achievements and that's why
[00:19:04] they are unpaid they are the unpaid
[00:19:07] employees but hopefully today they are
[00:19:08] going to do something special and earn
[00:19:11] their money today so we are still
[00:19:13] waiting for them to set up on stage but
[00:19:15] we have an overview of the games that
[00:19:17] are going to be played today so we have
[00:19:20] four content creators here which are
[00:19:22] going to be of course as you guys have
[00:19:24] already seen Z Toronto on team one and
[00:19:27] then on the second team we have got fob
[00:19:29] master and psycho and then yeah and then
[00:19:33] the tournament will be happening over
[00:19:35] two days so on the first day today the
[00:19:38] our two teams will play three rounds of
[00:19:40] mini games followed by a boss fight
[00:19:44] really really exciting a great
[00:19:45] opportunity for them to show their
[00:19:47] skills and then day two happening
[00:19:49] tomorrow will include two rounds of
[00:19:53] entertaining mini games and another Boss
[00:19:57] Rush fight now before each round the
[00:19:59] teams will be placing secret bats using
[00:20:02] all of the points that they've
[00:20:04] accumulated and the winner could choose
[00:20:08] the match mode so we're keeping things
[00:20:10] spiced up and
[00:20:12] unpredictable and every single
[00:20:13] competition we are going to have three
[00:20:15] rounds each time so we're going to have
[00:20:16] nine games in total today first game a
[00:20:19] little little hint I believe is going to
[00:20:21] be a racing game so that's going to be
[00:20:24] exciting using one of our favorite
[00:20:26] beloved characters saou so that should
[00:20:29] be interesting here we go we have the
[00:20:30] rules on the screen right now each team
[00:20:33] will consist of two members totaling
[00:20:35] four partipants and the four
[00:20:37] participants will all be using a
[00:20:39] constellation 6 saou to race from the
[00:20:42] designated starting point to the Finish
[00:20:44] Line yeah and during the race the
[00:20:46] participants will not be allowed to
[00:20:48] consume any food or potions or use any
[00:20:50] gadgets to increase their movement speed
[00:20:52] so it is really coming down to Pure
[00:20:55] skill and every single race will have a
[00:20:57] time limit of six minutes and you can
[00:21:01] see the starting points and the specific
[00:21:02] checkpoints there for you as well I
[00:21:05] believe that starting point is in the
[00:21:08] Lea chinka Village mhm yeah looks like a
[00:21:11] pretty um Dynamic route I don't know
[00:21:14] about you U but when I was younger I
[00:21:16] really liked playing Sonic
[00:21:19] games so this type of game is right up
[00:21:23] my alley it's going to be very
[00:21:25] interesting I believe we are seeing one
[00:21:27] of the contestants right now oh okay we
[00:21:30] have we have a demonstration of the
[00:21:32] route that we're going through here this
[00:21:35] is of course sped up right now in the
[00:21:36] real game it's not going to be this fast
[00:21:38] but yes they do have to stay within
[00:21:41] confines of this specific area they
[00:21:43] cannot like go off off off the rails of
[00:21:47] course yeah and I believe this is the
[00:21:51] chairs are the Finish Line are the
[00:21:53] finish line so they do have to stick to
[00:21:54] that specific route and if they go of
[00:21:57] course they are going to be in trouble
[00:21:58] they have a total of six minutes to
[00:22:00] achieve this I don't think it'll take
[00:22:02] six minutes how long do you think it'll
[00:22:04] take U I want to
[00:22:07] say the players are capable they are
[00:22:10] ar60 players they should be capable of
[00:22:13] doing this within 2 minutes maybe three
[00:22:15] minutes that's true yeah but I don't
[00:22:17] know I I've seen some ar60 players that
[00:22:20] still don't know what they're doing
[00:22:22] myself included for sure it would be
[00:22:25] very embarrassing if they cannot do this
[00:22:27] in six minutes oh the pressure is on oh
[00:22:30] we have the players lining up here and
[00:22:32] as you can see we are currently zoomed
[00:22:34] in on F's screen and on the right hand
[00:22:36] side of the screen we have psycho zos
[00:22:38] and
[00:22:41] Tanto I think we can hear sai's voice
[00:22:44] here Idol lines of her snorting and we
[00:22:47] have some interesting conversation
[00:22:49] coming through from the players if the F
[00:22:52] Master if we take a look at his screen
[00:22:54] we can see we all lament
[00:22:56] IRL
[00:23:01] and they are
[00:23:05] off okay and the contestants are off as
[00:23:09] you can see I believe fob Master is
[00:23:11] actually in the lead right
[00:23:14] now oh they are trailing fob right now
[00:23:17] and you can use as many Elemental skills
[00:23:19] as you like to do as
[00:23:21] well oh but Zio is run out of stamina so
[00:23:25] he's a little bit behind oh my God is
[00:23:28] zionic doing what is this skill issue we
[00:23:31] have a random zong Lee appearing here as
[00:23:34] well to has transformed into zombie
[00:23:37] and sabotage players right
[00:23:41] now in the lead we currently have I
[00:23:44] believe fob is still in the lead mhm he
[00:23:47] is about to hit the finish line here and
[00:23:50] he has some stamina sphere and he is
[00:23:51] taking it and he's the first one to sit
[00:23:53] down along with psycho so we have team
[00:23:57] atsu's
[00:23:58] unemployed unpaid
[00:24:00] employees take the first win very
[00:24:03] questionable strategies coming through
[00:24:05] from ATS who's neglected children and
[00:24:07] maybe that is why they are indeed
[00:24:10] neglected be the other way
[00:24:13] around well interesting but very very
[00:24:16] poor performance coming out from zionic
[00:24:18] and Toronto there questionable
[00:24:20] strategies but we will we'll have to see
[00:24:22] what they have in store for us in the
[00:24:24] next round the first point goes over to
[00:24:27] team team psycho and team fob Master but
[00:24:29] hey it is only the start it is still
[00:24:32] anyone's game for winning these points
[00:24:36] so exciting stuff hopefully we get a
[00:24:40] better performance coming out from Nick
[00:24:42] and
[00:24:44] Jake I wonder what they're
[00:24:48] cooking supposedly I've just heard from
[00:24:50] zionic that he didn't know you could
[00:24:52] hold the elemental skill for that long
[00:24:54] so he just tapped it and then ended up
[00:24:57] having to Sprint
[00:24:58] well you learn something new every day
[00:25:00] even as an experienced genin player as
[00:25:03] Winnie said earlier some ar60 players
[00:25:05] are clueless and as we know Mr Z only
[00:25:09] plays with sha so not too surprising
[00:25:12] that he is
[00:25:15] clueless Jake on the other hand Tanto on
[00:25:18] the other hand not sure why he switched
[00:25:19] over to zongi very very interesting
[00:25:22] pecul strategies technically there isn't
[00:25:25] anything in the rules that says that is
[00:25:27] true
[00:25:28] that you cannot switch off it only says
[00:25:30] that you need to use sa to Sprint that
[00:25:33] is true I think he tried to use the
[00:25:34] pillar to try and stop fob and psycho it
[00:25:38] didn't work it was you know as a zly
[00:25:41] main myself it was very painful to see
[00:25:43] such a poor execution of the zongi
[00:25:45] elemental skill but you know I can't
[00:25:47] expect much from Gan main so it is what
[00:25:50] it is it is what it
[00:25:52] is oh he's looking very angry now I
[00:25:56] think that was a little un called for
[00:25:59] Len tough love is tough
[00:26:02] love all right this time they are
[00:26:05] starting to line up here they are just
[00:26:07] preparing and we will shortly be on the
[00:26:10] way for race number
[00:26:13] two is this some trash talking that
[00:26:15] we're seeing they're saying I love genin
[00:26:18] impact oooo oh oh oh they said ATU
[00:26:22] stinks and as you can see spelling is
[00:26:24] not their strongest Forte here saying
[00:26:29] and now they're self-promoting
[00:26:31] themselves well you can see all their
[00:26:33] twitch handles there F Master psycho Z
[00:26:35] and Tanto the race has started and we
[00:26:38] are neck and
[00:26:39] neck we have F master in the lead right
[00:26:42] now once again very very neck and neck I
[00:26:45] can hardly tell who oh my gosh they all
[00:26:48] like stopped their skill at the same
[00:26:50] time o
[00:26:53] ianto is in the lead here
[00:26:56] actually look looking at his camera I
[00:26:58] don't see anyone in front of him Z as
[00:27:02] well though mhm it is neck and neck
[00:27:05] again very very close all I can hear all
[00:27:09] I can hear is that whir with all the
[00:27:11] leaves flying
[00:27:13] up oh it's so neck and neck they're all
[00:27:16] together right now
[00:27:19] close this time we have a pro strategy
[00:27:22] of actually holding down the elemental
[00:27:24] skill trying to cut the corners with the
[00:27:25] sharp turns contestants are learning
[00:27:28] slowly but surely oh psycho and F
[00:27:31] falling behind oh I believe we have a
[00:27:34] psycho or rather sorry a z and Tonto W
[00:27:38] coming through here they have redeemed
[00:27:41] themselves tying it up for a one
[00:27:45] all well done to atsu's neglected
[00:27:49] children very well done maybe I will pay
[00:27:52] you guys some attention in the future
[00:27:55] now so this time we saw from last game
[00:27:59] the zongi was ineffective and they both
[00:28:02] decided to do some very sharp turns
[00:28:04] there which I do think gave them the
[00:28:06] slight
[00:28:09] Edge yeah they have learned they're just
[00:28:11] relying on the elemental skill I mean
[00:28:13] after all it does take a while to change
[00:28:16] characters and switch back and that is
[00:28:19] true in a game like this every second
[00:28:21] counts it's kind of like in the spiral
[00:28:23] Abyss you know every single second
[00:28:25] counts it will make the difference yeah
[00:28:27] who do you think is going to take the
[00:28:29] third game
[00:28:33] ooh it's hard to say honestly I feel
[00:28:36] like you know them better than I do U
[00:28:39] sorry not to redirect it back to you or
[00:28:40] anything I know there's a lot of
[00:28:41] attention already with these team names
[00:28:44] a lot of love I think next
[00:28:49] round we have lift off
[00:28:53] here
[00:28:55] soon in three
[00:28:58] two
[00:29:00] one
[00:29:02] go theyve gone oh we had a we had a
[00:29:04] quick start there from I believe who is
[00:29:07] that in front is that is that fob no no
[00:29:09] I believe that is z in front or TW and Z
[00:29:13] once again in front the elemental skill
[00:29:15] ends
[00:29:18] there you can hear the S they're very
[00:29:24] enthusiastic we have player R1 in the
[00:29:26] lead I believe R1 is I believe it is
[00:29:30] Tanto here in the bottom right corner
[00:29:32] you can see in his camera that no one is
[00:29:34] in front of him beside oh actually never
[00:29:36] mind he has been overtaken here I
[00:29:39] believe Z is one to get in the
[00:29:43] lead oh it's looking like another team Z
[00:29:46] and Toronto W potentially incoming here
[00:29:51] no I believe I believe in Z
[00:29:54] [Music]
[00:29:56] and
[00:29:58] oh and psycho both get on the chairs at
[00:30:00] the same time but fob Master is the
[00:30:02] first one to sit down meaning that fob
[00:30:05] and psycho take the
[00:30:08] win I told you I called it I called it
[00:30:11] at the last second there very well done
[00:30:14] to team fob and psycho atsu's unpaid
[00:30:18] employees they are doing something truly
[00:30:21] spectacular today I sure hope that they
[00:30:23] will be paid after
[00:30:25] this well they did earn their bread
[00:30:29] there very very good comeback there
[00:30:31] coming from I believe pyo and Tonto the
[00:30:34] two t were neck and neck there and then
[00:30:38] right at the end fob just overtook Zio
[00:30:42] to the seat and claiming the victory 21
[00:30:46] so we are going to start preparing for
[00:30:49] the next round in a moment and the next
[00:30:51] game if I take a look at definitely not
[00:30:54] a script down here we have
[00:30:58] ooh we have a bit of a maze for you guys
[00:31:01] incoming which is going to be
[00:31:04] interesting right now we're just
[00:31:05] calculating the points although we do
[00:31:06] know who the victors are but just to
[00:31:09] make sure that everything was done
[00:31:11] correctly we are just having a moment to
[00:31:13] check as
[00:31:15] well and as you can see there we have
[00:31:18] ATU neglected children with 20 points
[00:31:21] versus the 25 points of atsu's unpaid
[00:31:25] employees I would say this is still
[00:31:27] anyone's game again that was only the
[00:31:30] first round and the first match there's
[00:31:33] a five-point difference but you know
[00:31:36] comebacks can happen always as long as
[00:31:39] they don't give up on Hope anything can
[00:31:44] happen I think they are currently
[00:31:46] strategizing right now both to and Z we
[00:31:49] can see them right to our right hand
[00:31:51] side over here and then dor and fob are
[00:31:55] further down there but who do you think
[00:31:57] is going to take game two
[00:32:00] oo so game two I believe is not
[00:32:03] necessarily about speed there's a speed
[00:32:05] component but you also have to be doing
[00:32:09] a little more strategizing and also have
[00:32:11] a better sense of direction instead of
[00:32:13] just running straight
[00:32:15] forward
[00:32:19] so I'm going to go with seio and fav
[00:32:22] again I just have a gut feeling a gut
[00:32:24] feeling wow one of the costes is does
[00:32:27] not believe in the neglected children
[00:32:29] zionic and Tonto I believe in you this
[00:32:32] time around I believe that you will be
[00:32:35] able to find your way out of the
[00:32:38] maze I I'm currently receiving some
[00:32:41] brain waves from Toronto not sure what
[00:32:43] he's trying to say here but I think he
[00:32:44] said believe in me and I will believe in
[00:32:47] him
[00:32:50] so I think on the way soon we are also
[00:32:53] going to have a raffle for those of you

[00:36:23] and we are going to soon load up into
[00:36:25] the next match which is is going to be
[00:36:27] the serener teapot maze match so we are
[00:36:30] going to have some custom mazes built in
[00:36:32] the serener teapot for the contestants
[00:36:34] to try and
[00:36:36] be yeah and speaking of I just want to
[00:36:39] give acknowledgement to all the genjin
[00:36:42] players who have actually worked on
[00:36:44] their teapot very true it takes so much
[00:36:47] time and effort and energy how how how's
[00:36:51] your teapot looking like are you a
[00:36:52] teapot player well I have got over the
[00:36:56] 20 ,000 you know the the points for the
[00:36:59] teapot to Max it out but my teapot is an
[00:37:02] acquired taste ah I see I see sounds
[00:37:05] pretty similar to mine well in these
[00:37:08] teapots again we will be having a uh
[00:37:11] special mini game we'll be doing the
[00:37:13] Serena teapot maze uh and again we will
[00:37:17] have our teams uh consisting of two
[00:37:20] members so will be the four players in
[00:37:22] total and each team will be selecting
[00:37:25] one map as the challenge map and then
[00:37:28] for each round the players will be using
[00:37:30] the same character to escape the Maze
[00:37:32] and they have a time limit of 6 minutes
[00:37:35] yet again and if they fail within the 6
[00:37:37] minutes to legitimately leave the maze
[00:37:40] they are allowed to start climbing up
[00:37:41] the walls trying to get a better point
[00:37:43] of view to escape and as you can see we
[00:37:46] are loading into the teapots now I'm so
[00:37:49] excited to see what this means looks
[00:37:51] like I wonder how complicated it is we
[00:37:54] we just saw there a fainted side you
[00:37:58] very interesting but yeah we do see the
[00:38:00] maze there and it is we got a small
[00:38:03] glimpse and I I do think we saw like
[00:38:04] some little distractions on the ground
[00:38:06] in the Maze there so that's going to be
[00:38:07] interesting yeah so again it's not just
[00:38:09] about escaping it's not just about going
[00:38:12] Full Speed Ahead you got to use your
[00:38:15] your widths and your brain got to have
[00:38:17] some um directional capacity you got to
[00:38:21] coordinate with your team member very
[00:38:23] carefully I believe the best strategy
[00:38:25] for this is to go different directions
[00:38:27] and communicate to each other oh I think
[00:38:29] this is the right way or oh this is a
[00:38:31] dead end and they they just got to make
[00:38:33] sure they have their NorthEast Southwest
[00:38:36] All In
[00:38:37] Tune and we are loaded in mhm I have
[00:38:40] heard U that oh they've started oh wow
[00:38:44] it looks like they're just going full
[00:38:46] they're all going full speed they've all
[00:38:47] gone with sa as well and they have
[00:38:50] started to split up too is by himself
[00:38:53] being tailed by psycho and master I
[00:38:57] believe is being tailed by Zs right now
[00:38:59] oh we have three of them oh look at this
[00:39:01] maze oh my goodness branching out now oh
[00:39:03] my we see a I believe this is a a
[00:39:06] circular dead end there from from Z and
[00:39:10] oh oh we found the exit here and I
[00:39:13] believe the first person out was Tonto
[00:39:15] psycho was second and I believe F master
[00:39:18] was third and Z was more there I may
[00:39:20] have Miss missen that but it just
[00:39:22] happens so fast I believe the winning
[00:39:25] team is whoever gets out of the maze
[00:39:27] first and I believe tono was the very
[00:39:28] first person out of the Maze and so our
[00:39:30] winner for the first round is U's
[00:39:34] neglected
[00:39:35] children wow I shall neglect you guys no
[00:39:39] more if you can take this all the way
[00:39:40] home as a clean sweep so hopefully that
[00:39:44] gives them some morale to try their
[00:39:45] absolute very very very
[00:39:49] best Toto give me a
[00:39:52] wave did you win
[00:39:54] that he won that
[00:39:57] surely he's not lying to me but he
[00:39:58] definitely won that so we have another W
[00:40:01] for Jake and Nick hopefully they are
[00:40:05] going to put up another strong showing I
[00:40:06] believe they do get to choose the map
[00:40:08] now the challenge map so this should be
[00:40:11] interesting they they are in the
[00:40:12] ascendancy they have the advantage of
[00:40:14] course it is worth keeping in mind that
[00:40:17] the points are currently 2225 in favor
[00:40:20] of fob master and psycho
[00:40:23] team yeah so they're they're like
[00:40:26] catching up and catch making their way
[00:40:28] back up so again it's anyone's game and
[00:40:32] we will have a Four Points calculation
[00:40:34] at the end so you guys can see who who
[00:40:36] has gained the most points and I can see
[00:40:39] from the corner of my eye every time I
[00:40:40] glance over there it's because I can see
[00:40:42] both Nick and Jake twano and zionic
[00:40:45] screens they are all setting up with
[00:40:47] saus once again we have Dawn and F
[00:40:50] looking a little bit nervous there for a
[00:40:52] moment both glamorous but slightly
[00:40:54] nervous I believe that they will be be
[00:40:56] able to bring in the comeback as well
[00:40:58] yeah I totally believe yo they have my
[00:41:00] full support wow okay she's picked the
[00:41:03] side already totally not cuz I'm biased
[00:41:05] towards cosplayers or anything oh I see
[00:41:08] I see I see well if you haven't seen
[00:41:11] already zionic has a very Charming a
[00:41:13] cosplay that's true ious see a lot of
[00:41:16] people commented on that it was very
[00:41:19] eye-catching and we are loaded in now
[00:41:22] the countdown will begin soon 4 3
[00:41:26] 2 1 go go go I believe they selected a
[00:41:31] similar maze again if not the same maze
[00:41:33] no it must be a similar Maze and they've
[00:41:34] all gone the wrong way so I believe this
[00:41:36] is a different maze just the same walls
[00:41:39] and we have oh unless that's the story I
[00:41:41] think that was the entrance no maybe
[00:41:44] saer I believe is out
[00:41:47] already saer has already left so she is
[00:41:51] the winner here wow the other three seem
[00:41:53] to be lost Bob Master Clueless
[00:41:55] unsurprised L Tonto is also looking very
[00:41:59] lost right now and is rolling rolling
[00:42:03] rolling they do see each other here I
[00:42:06] believe if Z and TW are able to find the
[00:42:09] exit before fob the points will not be
[00:42:11] too big you will not have that big of a
[00:42:14] disparity psyo just zooming in and out
[00:42:16] flexing her W here B Master looking
[00:42:20] absolutely lost right now toono looking
[00:42:23] absolutely lost right now Z's too short
[00:42:25] to see over the wall
[00:42:26] mhm and then you do have to keep in
[00:42:29] mindu that for the short characters they
[00:42:33] do have less stamina to move around
[00:42:35] because of their legs but looks like fob
[00:42:38] has managed to find the exit and I
[00:42:41] believe as you can see it's long time Z
[00:42:44] have given up
[00:42:45] here they've stopped moving they have
[00:42:47] accepted that defeat of the superior
[00:42:50] team no no no it is not over it's not
[00:42:52] over they still need to get those points
[00:42:54] so they want to get out of the maze oh I
[00:42:57] believe we found the exit for Toronto Z
[00:43:00] still
[00:43:02] lost here are the
[00:43:05] coms well we have our winners which are
[00:43:07] going to be Psycho and F Master for this
[00:43:11] round another win for U's neglected
[00:43:16] children I don't think I'll ever get
[00:43:17] unpaid employees oh sorry unpaid
[00:43:20] employees I apologize that that was what
[00:43:22] I saw at the bottom of the screen but
[00:43:24] you know I think regardless of which
[00:43:26] team it is that's winning I will never
[00:43:28] get tired of saying these team names we
[00:43:30] have the wonderful zionic and Tu on the
[00:43:33] screen right now tono shaking his head
[00:43:36] looks like he's uh typing a message to
[00:43:38] someone I don't know maybe he might get
[00:43:40] something soonu some some disapproval
[00:43:43] perhaps maybe for me let me have a quick
[00:43:47] Gander no no no it's not to me I'm not
[00:43:50] in trouble guys I'm not in trouble
[00:43:52] really tto is not flaming definitely not
[00:43:54] flaming me no no no no no
[00:43:57] okay so we are going to have another
[00:43:59] round I believe this time team f master
[00:44:02] and team psycho will be the ones picking
[00:44:04] the map this time so advantage to them
[00:44:07] right now I really wonder what map
[00:44:09] they'll choose this time if it'll be I
[00:44:11] guess all the maps look the same so I'm
[00:44:14] curious how they distinguish
[00:44:19] them I believe oh and in the meantime we
[00:44:22] have the raffle winner down here at the
[00:44:25] bottom congratul ulations to Pal 2002

[00:44:51] I've lived through the digital age I'm
[00:44:54] very old for those of you who don't know
[00:44:56] 54 years young and I've lived through
[00:44:59] the evolution of time before we had
[00:45:01] phones in my back in my day we didn't
[00:45:04] have these we didn't have technology
[00:45:06] like this but now you got smartphones
[00:45:10] that flip open and Clos absolutely crazy
[00:45:12] to me mhm we have Danto and zionic here

[00:46:26] here and we are going to have the
[00:46:29] countdown here in three 2 1 go go go and
[00:46:35] once again Tonto very quick Off the Mark
[00:46:38] into a dead end straight away Z also
[00:46:41] going into the same dead end psycho also
[00:46:43] going to the same dead end B Master
[00:46:45] going somewhere else by himself right
[00:46:47] now and I believe no he is still lost
[00:46:50] they are still finding their
[00:46:53] way I think they just ran back to the
[00:46:55] entr
[00:46:57] they are very disorientated right now I
[00:47:00] mean it's hard to tell in this maze
[00:47:01] where everything looks the same right I
[00:47:03] am very lost I think if I was competing
[00:47:06] I would be struggling a little too so
[00:47:08] Master hitting a dead end there psycho
[00:47:10] following him and realizing oh oh they
[00:47:12] all followed him to the same dead end
[00:47:15] it's like the blind leading the blind
[00:47:17] they are they are indeed okay surely
[00:47:20] they're going to be able to find the
[00:47:21] exit TW has already left I believe is
[00:47:25] that the Finish Line I believe that is
[00:47:27] the Finish Line possibly unless he's
[00:47:29] just standing still and giv
[00:47:31] up Tonto give us a roll if you're in the
[00:47:34] Finish Line oh I believe someone else

[00:47:37] psycho Dawn and we also have Z making it
[00:47:41] to the finish line and last and
[00:47:43] definitely least is f master who is

[00:52:41] survival challenge so speed is not going
[00:52:45] to be as important well I guess it'll be
[00:52:48] a little important it will really come

[00:52:56] zly m how would you rate your dodging

[00:53:14] keep that Astra Carnival spam going in
[00:53:17] twitch.tv/ ASR Carnival as we do prepare
[00:53:20] the next match once again the OnePlus
[00:53:23] very very very wonderful phone of course
[00:53:26] I am very tempted just just to just oh
[00:53:29] my
[00:53:30] gosh good thing this isn't being
[00:53:32] recorded anywhere right wow I'm going to
[00:53:35] have a word with the staff behind the
[00:53:37] scenes after this I'll get on my knees
[00:53:38] and be like please I have one of the One
[00:53:41] Plus on your knees one plus phones yeah
[00:53:43] they're really really cool
[00:53:45] phones my my flatmate actually got one
[00:53:47] of these recently and he's always
[00:53:49] flexing like your screen is so small
[00:53:51] when you're watching anime when you're
[00:53:53] playing games and you're just showing it
[00:53:55] all the time that's true that's true
[00:53:57] I've also seen people using the phone
[00:53:59] and it's very useful for you know taking
[00:54:02] selfies because you directly on the
[00:54:04] front but uh unlike other phones that
[00:54:06] don't have as good of a front camera the
[00:54:09] quality on this one is pretty good still
[00:54:11] very solid Chef's kisses or as we say on
[00:54:14] Twitch POG
[00:54:16] champ is it is it is it past the era of
[00:54:19] POG champ now do we not we say pogers
[00:54:20] now as well right pogy pogy oh pogies is
[00:54:23] involved in pogies I I only say
[00:54:25] now can we get some oh in the chat
[00:54:28] Om pogies I'm not a pogies person well
[00:54:32] we have the rules for the next
[00:54:34] challenge and this is going to be one
[00:54:37] that I have personally done many times a
[00:54:40] shout out to my channel guys go watch
[00:54:42] the ging games we have done the ston
[00:54:44] high lava child survival challenge and
[00:54:47] in this one each team of course has the
[00:54:49] two members all players must use the
[00:54:51] same C6 Geo traveler without any gear
[00:54:55] here so that all the stats are even no
[00:54:56] disparities between the stats to start
[00:54:58] the challenge at the beway plane and all
[00:55:01] players must try to avoid the lava Char
[00:55:04] attacks and survive for 5 minutes now
[00:55:07] both Jake AKA Tanto and also F Master do
[00:55:10] have experience with this I have drilled
[00:55:13] this competition into them Twan actually
[00:55:16] I believe the last time he did this came
[00:55:18] out on top and was very very very
[00:55:21] success successful F Master also has a
[00:55:24] lot of experence with this so they are
[00:55:26] going to have to switch over to geot
[00:55:27] traveler in a moment I believe they can
[00:55:29] use abilities to try and disrupt each
[00:55:31] other they are not allowed to eliminate
[00:55:34] the geol lava child though and they have
[00:55:36] to keep running around to survive yeah
[00:55:39] so again it really really comes down to
[00:55:42] uh I guess this is what they would call
[00:55:44] a battle of attrition they're fighting
[00:55:46] against the clock yeah patience is going
[00:55:49] to be very very key now the way the lava
[00:55:52] tra works is I'm sure they're going to
[00:55:54] have a agre agement here the contestants
[00:55:56] that each round someone's going to have
[00:55:57] to take the Agro so someone has to take
[00:55:59] the Agro first from the geol lavaa and
[00:56:02] then lavaa will focus that one specific
[00:56:06] player however you can use that to your
[00:56:08] advantage because if you know the lavaa
[00:56:10] is going to follow you well you just
[00:56:12] need to stay in the pack and keep going
[00:56:13] for the enemy member and hope that your
[00:56:16] dodging will be more precise than their
[00:56:18] dodging and of course you can drop
[00:56:20] Elemental skills as you can see here
[00:56:22] that will obstruct each other and the
[00:56:24] lava char
[00:56:25] as well
[00:56:27] mhm I have heard my friends say that
[00:56:29] their favorite traveler element to use
[00:56:31] in Co-op specifically is the Geo
[00:56:35] traveler wow and whether that's to uh be
[00:56:38] a helper or a hindrance to the team I'm
[00:56:41] not really sure but we'll see that in
[00:56:44] action here well I believe we started
[00:56:47] here and I think the aggro there was
[00:56:49] taken by I think it was either Bob or
[00:56:52] Tonto taking the Agro here Z taking a
[00:56:56] big hit losing half his hit points
[00:56:58] already we see Twan F Master still on
[00:57:01] full HP we see the elemental burst and
[00:57:03] Elemental skills going down I also
[00:57:05] believe they do have to stay within the
[00:57:07] ring as well in the past we have seen
[00:57:09] people climb up the trees that are still
[00:57:11] in the ring to try and avoid the lava
[00:57:13] Cho they have trapped the lava Cho on
[00:57:15] top of the geoc contract the geoc
[00:57:16] contract bre lava Cho comes down and we
[00:57:19] still see the lav very intimidatingly
[00:57:21] following I believe it is Bob master who
[00:57:24] does have the
[00:57:26] Agro lava also does not currently have
[00:57:29] his Geo shield on right now meaning the
[00:57:31] large Geo attacks are not going to come
[00:57:33] out from the lava child I believe the
[00:57:35] aggro has now switched over fodm has no
[00:57:37] longer being the one targeted here I
[00:57:39] believe the aggro is now on I think it's
[00:57:42] zionic is the one seemingly taking the
[00:57:45] aggro here oh no no no it's on
[00:57:48] psycho cuz everyone oh I think
[00:57:51] everyone's taking turns to just chip
[00:57:53] away at the lavaa very slowly so the
[00:57:55] Agro is being switched over and over we
[00:57:58] do have 3 minutes and 40 seconds that's
[00:58:01] still plenty of time so what I'd like to
[00:58:04] see is the lavaur reenable his Geo
[00:58:06] shield and then his attacks will become
[00:58:08] way more explosive and a lot more
[00:58:11] dangerous like a moment of respite for
[00:58:14] our competitors but it looks like they
[00:58:17] have this down to a science doing really
[00:58:20] well dodging and avoiding the
[00:58:23] attacks sorry
[00:58:25] is the only one that has lost any hit
[00:58:29] points oh here it comes the Geo Shield
[00:58:32] has been enabled we're going to get the
[00:58:34] large attack the slim throwing attack
[00:58:36] jumping attack and we do see the chest
[00:58:39] there I'm like so tempted I just
[00:58:42] want oh taking a massive hit
[00:58:46] there and he and he's still being
[00:58:48] aggroed on ooh this is going to be
[00:58:53] interesting dant and z are both down on
[00:58:56] HP right now not just that but their
[00:58:58] stamina is also pretty low too this is
[00:59:00] getting to be really dicey recovering
[00:59:02] the stamina getting some of it back
[00:59:05] stamina management is going to beit what
[00:59:07] that we see going up the tree we see oh
[00:59:10] he's gone against the ideas decided
[00:59:12] against it the aggro has switched a
[00:59:13] little bit of Mercy from the other team
[00:59:15] I believe psycho and F Master just
[00:59:18] giving giving TW to a chance here M we
[00:59:21] have 2 minutes and 20 seconds left 2
[00:59:24] minutes and 20 seconds remaining or
[00:59:26] rather 2 minutes and 10 seconds now
[00:59:28] remaining the Geo Shield is now expired
[00:59:30] once again I believe there is just about
[00:59:32] enough time for the Geo Shield to be
[00:59:34] re-enabled so maybe it's going to get a
[00:59:37] little bit dicey towards the end here
[00:59:38] but right now they can play a little bit
[00:59:40] safe there's no large scale attacks or
[00:59:42] large are effect attacks here coming
[00:59:44] through tono once again Red Bar
[00:59:48] HP avoid the jump no [ __ ] coming out of
[00:59:51] the ground once again because the Geo
[00:59:52] Shield is off and and I believe is Z
[00:59:55] still alive has he passed away I was
[00:59:58] just about to say I oh I think Z is on
[01:00:01] the screen three Travelers oh oh
[01:00:06] oh oh oh I think Z yes Z has passed away
[01:00:10] oh no he he has he has faded away and we
[01:00:14] have the Geo Shield once again
[01:00:16] re-enabled psyo and F Master still on
[01:00:19] full HP mhm they're looking pretty good
[01:00:21] Bob Master stop being a coward and take
[01:00:23] the aggro we want to see a challenge
[01:00:26] here okay we see psycho and B
[01:00:30] Master oh we see psycho taking aggro
[01:00:33] here I think it's a one V one now
[01:00:36] actually oh it is a One V one versato
[01:00:39] and psycho I didn't see him but wow I
[01:00:41] believe F master has also perished as
[01:00:44] well maybe he took your words a little
[01:00:46] too much to heartu he is it is a One V
[01:00:49] one here Sy on full HP Tonto Living on a
[01:00:53] Prayer right now a little bit on life
[01:00:55] support we have 40 seconds we got a hit
[01:00:58] here I believe psycho just took a hit
[01:01:01] there it's getting very very dicey we
[01:01:03] have 30 seconds just about 30 seconds
[01:01:06] remaining on the board the Geo Shield is
[01:01:07] going to expire though and if they are
[01:01:09] able to survive I believe this round
[01:01:11] will be a
[01:01:13] tie Geo Shield is down so now it's just
[01:01:18] it's just plain sailing now very easy
[01:01:20] for them these last 20
[01:01:23] seconds Agro is still on Toronto ooh
[01:01:28] that jump was a little bit
[01:01:29] close 10 seconds remaining seven 6 5 4 3
[01:01:36] 2 1 and I believe this is a tie unless
[01:01:40] they're counting the HP in which case
[01:01:42] psycho did have more HP remaining but we
[01:01:45] see both toono and psyo surviving
[01:01:48] apologies my eyesight was ped there
[01:01:50] because I didn't see both Z and F Master
[01:01:52] getting eliminated there there was so
[01:01:55] much happening so many rocks like
[01:01:57] constructs coming up so and those
[01:01:59] constructs are pretty big too they
[01:02:01] really cover your character so a lot of
[01:02:04] obstruction there fob looking very proud
[01:02:06] of himself even though he perished not
[01:02:08] sure why he's so happy about that
[01:02:10] holding down psyo for psycho yeah
[01:02:12] exactly you know team spirit team spirit

[01:03:32] future here and we have got another
[01:03:37] round incoming very very very soon uh I
[01:03:41] see The Travelers hopping on the side
[01:03:43] here every time I glance over here we
[01:03:44] have Tonto and psycho cameras here right
[01:03:47] now I see some balloons being released
[01:03:49] looks like uh everyone is excited to be
[01:03:52] here and eager to get started so the
[01:03:54] first match was I believe it was a tie
[01:03:57] so this one might be the one for the W
[01:03:59] here but we will get confirmation of
[01:04:01] that in a moment so we see aggro is on
[01:04:05] Dawn this time psycho taking the aggro
[01:04:07] the aggro will keep switching because I
[01:04:09] believe they do have an agreement to
[01:04:10] keep hitting the lava charm keeping
[01:04:12] things challenging I think someone just
[01:04:15] got hit there but I'm not 100% sure
[01:04:18] because we can't see I don't know my
[01:04:20] attention was on to huge Dodge there
[01:04:24] coming from psycho and I
[01:04:26] think I think Tanto may have just been
[01:04:32] eliminated I only see three people on
[01:04:35] the screen now I think to just got El
[01:04:37] psycho taking a massive hit there is it
[01:04:39] going to combo her her out oh she Dodges
[01:04:43] she Dodges through the two jumps there
[01:04:46] surviving with less just a well under
[01:04:48] 50% HP nowo oh no too is still
[01:04:52] alive twano is still alive
[01:04:54] the screaming I heard from the side also
[01:04:56] he did take a hit as well he also lost
[01:04:59] around 4,000 hit points I'm wondering
[01:05:01] though U if these competitors are you
[01:05:03] know like flexing a little you know
[01:05:05] trying to trying to do show off their
[01:05:07] dodging skills as much as possible I see
[01:05:10] someone slowly walking around the stage
[01:05:13] I believe that is that's F Master he's
[01:05:16] just walking trying to be oh he's a
[01:05:18] coward now he's running the aggro switch
[01:05:20] is is not such a big man now oh run away
[01:05:24] caught on the geoc contract almost
[01:05:26] almost got sabotaged by the geoc
[01:05:28] contract there the aggro has once again
[01:05:31] switched I believe it is now chasing
[01:05:36] pyo and I think he's going to switch
[01:05:37] here again it switches again who's it
[01:05:40] going for they're trying to flex with
[01:05:42] the walking here oh here comes the goo
[01:05:45] let's see if B Master is going to be
[01:05:46] able to walk his way through this one oh
[01:05:50] what a what a b he gets eliminated oh
[01:05:54] and po Master they got two arrogant and
[01:05:57] two cocky and they both had a double
[01:05:59] elimination fools absolutely Shameless
[01:06:02] absolutely
[01:06:03] Shameless If Only They were tall as
[01:06:06] their egos
[01:06:08] wow what a shame what an absolute shame
[01:06:11] we have Sao and Tonto once again facing
[01:06:14] off in the 1 V one both Z and F Master
[01:06:17] holding these two Champions back you
[01:06:20] hate to see it
[01:06:23] embarrassing
[01:06:26] I'm not going to um I will not agree or
[01:06:29] disagree
[01:06:30] with eliminated takes home the W that's
[01:06:35] with 2 minutes and 20 seconds on the
[01:06:37] clock congratulations to team Tanto and
[01:06:41] team zionic as Tanto is about to drown
[01:06:43] here off screen
[01:06:46] congratulations so the first match was a
[01:06:48] tie they were able to live through the
[01:06:50] entire was it 6 minutes 3 minutes I want
[01:06:53] to say five 5 minutes minutes minutes
[01:06:55] they were able to survive the time limit
[01:06:57] this time around Tanto was the last
[01:06:59] alive we had a little bit of cockos
[01:07:02] coming through from zionic and fob
[01:07:04] master and it cost them dearly mhm looks
[01:07:06] like they got a little too
[01:07:08] overconfidence overconfident for
[01:07:11] sure oh look look at look at zionic on
[01:07:13] camera here making excuses making
[01:07:18] excuses face the camera and have some
[01:07:20] shame zionic have some shame you almost
[01:07:24] crossed Toronto you almost crossed
[01:07:27] Toronto the W here so I believe we are
[01:07:31] going to have another raffle soon as
[01:07:33] well but before we get into the raffle
[01:07:35] what did you make of their
[01:07:37] performances what sorry what did you
[01:07:39] make of the performances of the
[01:07:41] contestants in that game just now you
[01:07:43] know I think it was I I think they were
[01:07:45] trying to spice things up for you know
[01:07:47] our audience here at the booth at
[01:07:49] twitchcon and also for all of our
[01:07:52] viewers at home because you know it's
[01:07:54] kind of boring when things are a little
[01:07:56] too easy right so sometimes when you
[01:07:58] feel like the challenge isn't there you
[01:08:01] put some challenges on yourself some
[01:08:02] self-imposed limits and try to break
[01:08:05] those so I I got to give props to them
[01:08:08] for trying it out we'll cried yes yeah
[01:08:11] they cried and failed miserably but
[01:08:14] listen you can't grow as a person unless
[01:08:17] you make mistakes so hopefully they
[01:08:19] learn from their mistakes and they grow
[01:08:22] in their
[01:08:25] their yeah grow in their height as well
[01:08:28] you know and also grow up but yeah I
[01:08:31] believe I believe that that's going to
[01:08:32] be a valuable lesson to them fun master
[01:08:35] and Tonto PSO and zionic all having a
[01:08:40] hopefully a wonderful time on stage here
[01:08:42] at twitchcon we have the final round
[01:08:45] coming through and I believe yeah
[01:08:47] because they tied the first game you
[01:08:50] still do not have a clearcut winner
[01:08:51] exactly yeah so 3 2 1 and we start
[01:08:57] here and they're all hovering around the
[01:09:00] edge we see the aggro coming through
[01:09:02] there I believe F master was the one to
[01:09:04] take the aggro there but we know the
[01:09:06] aggro is going to keep switching oh
[01:09:09] twano actually being chased here teror
[01:09:11] smash Terror smash coming through from
[01:09:13] one of the characters I heard that very
[01:09:15] loud and
[01:09:17] clear all right he's chasing someone
[01:09:19] he's walking taking his time to chase
[01:09:21] the big lead comes through I think
[01:09:24] everyone was able to avoid that one
[01:09:25] landed on the Geo structure there good
[01:09:27] block by that geoc construct Terra smash
[01:09:30] another teror smash coming
[01:09:33] through and another one we've got plenty
[01:09:35] of those we got the Geo slime H coming
[01:09:36] through hitting absolutely nobody GI lav
[01:09:39] what are you doing you got to pick up
[01:09:40] your game okay the ground pound is the
[01:09:43] dangerous attack that one has a really
[01:09:45] really huge area of effect they are
[01:09:47] trying to chip away at his HP his Gio
[01:09:50] Shield so that they can play it
[01:09:52] safe
[01:09:55] oh surely that must have hit somebody
[01:09:58] there it did hit tto you can see his HP
[01:10:02] has dropped a little bit but the Geo
[01:10:05] Shield is down so little easier for our
[01:10:08] contestants they all seem to be running
[01:10:10] in the same direction not sure what the
[01:10:13] strategy here is oh wait toono is
[01:10:17] running is becoming one with the lava
[01:10:20] child he has truly become one with the
[01:10:23] oh the switch
[01:10:25] though that was very close that was very
[01:10:29] very very close a little bit too close
[01:10:31] for
[01:10:33] comfort we have a big leap coming
[01:10:35] through again once again no GEOS spikes
[01:10:37] coming out of the ground so they can
[01:10:38] still play it
[01:10:39] [Music]
[01:10:40] safe I propose a challenge to the four
[01:10:44] contestants you guys should all smack
[01:10:46] the lavaa at the same time and let fake
[01:10:50] the
[01:10:52] side
[01:10:54] okay we have the ground pound com
[01:10:55] through a double ground pound and it
[01:10:57] does eliminate too R toono is down we
[01:11:02] still see psycho is alive the other two
[01:11:04] contestants also alive we will see their
[01:11:07] HP in a moment once we move over from
[01:11:09] dant's
[01:11:11] camera psyo still looking healthy the LA
[01:11:14] tra was having a little shimmy with the
[01:11:16] treasure chest over there
[01:11:18] indeed psycho looking like a very very
[01:11:21] very strong contestant oh always one of
[01:11:24] the last alive
[01:11:26] here and the lava sh Shield is about to
[01:11:29] expire but one last harah gets a hit in
[01:11:33] on fob
[01:11:35] Master still chasing fob Master here
[01:11:37] slime
[01:11:39] misses will there be one more tack with
[01:11:41] the Geo shield on no the Geo Shield does
[01:11:43] get eliminated there down and we have 2
[01:11:46] minutes and 5 Seconds approaching on the
[01:11:50] clock Geo conru blocking the jump now
[01:11:54] Z still on full hit points I believe
[01:11:56] psycho is still on full hit points f
[01:11:58] Master is just over half
[01:12:01] HP we can hear the terror smash Terror
[01:12:04] smash coming through from the ethers
[01:12:06] here Terror smash how do you think you
[01:12:09] would fair in this competition winning
[01:12:11] ooh I don't know I will be honest and
[01:12:13] say I'm not the best at dodging but you
[01:12:15] know it's a l tur we've had worse maybe
[01:12:18] if it was the uh consecrated
[01:12:21] Beast true created Beast are very very
[01:12:25] scary okay the Geo Shield is back on for
[01:12:28] the last 90 Seconds Of The Showdown the
[01:12:31] geoc construct coming here with a huge
[01:12:33] block another geoc conu cominging with a
[01:12:35] huge block and he's just going after the
[01:12:38] geoc construct but it does hit Z in the
[01:12:41] periphery
[01:12:42] there they are trying to eliminate the
[01:12:45] shield here as quick as possible because
[01:12:48] this is when the scary attacks come out
[01:12:51] if they are able to eliminate Z team
[01:12:55] psycho and fog Master they are going to
[01:12:56] take the W they just need zionic to go
[01:13:00] down can Z repay toono for all the
[01:13:04] carries that he's had so
[01:13:08] far this is a 10 45 seconds left being
[01:13:12] very brave actually challenging the lava
[01:13:15] CH and smacking him taking on the aggro
[01:13:17] he's trying to flex a huge Dodge there
[01:13:20] and he oh no z z
[01:13:24] he got too big for his boots and he has
[01:13:27] been eliminated meaning team PSO and
[01:13:31] team Bob Master take this rounds W I
[01:13:35] believe after three rounds we have one
[01:13:38] tie and one win on either side
[01:13:41] [Music]
[01:13:43] M psycho there clapping Toto or rather
[01:13:48] fob Master they look a little out of
[01:13:50] breath they look a little stressed they
[01:13:52] you look a little bit stressed the
[01:13:54] posture is slowly crumbling posture
[01:13:56] check once again my posture was bad H
[01:13:59] check posture and hydration check guys
[01:14:01] make sure that you are well hydrated
[01:14:04] because we do still have more in
[01:14:07] store exactly yeah we have a day full of
[01:14:11] fun activities and of course can't
[01:14:13] forget the raffle for this very
[01:14:16] beautiful and functional OnePlus 11
[01:14:19] OnePlus 11 oneus 5G 11 phone very very
[01:14:23] very
[01:14:25] cool and we have the points coming
[01:14:27] through here we have ats's neglected
[01:14:30] children with this round for match three
[01:14:32] on 20 points and at unplayed employees
[01:14:34] with 25 points I do believe they started
[01:14:37] counting who died first M so if we count
[01:14:41] up the points here we have 70 points on
[01:14:44] the side of atsu's neglected children
[01:14:47] and 65 points if my maap is correct and
[01:14:50] I do believe it is correct so we have 70
[01:14:52] to 65 in favor of atsu's neglected
[01:14:56] children so they are ahead by the skin
[01:14:58] of their T only five points separates
[01:15:01] the two teams very very very close
[01:15:05] matchup
[01:15:07] still it's really anyone's game it is
[01:15:10] anyone's game who are you picking for
[01:15:12] the finale I'm sure that we're going to
[01:15:15] have a clearcut winner at the end think
[01:15:16] you have a CLE I think so H well you
[01:15:20] know I love a good Underdog Story so
[01:15:23] who who are the underdogs in these four
[01:15:25] clueless Gamers they're all terrible
[01:15:29] they're all
[01:15:30] underdogs you know I feel like every
[01:15:32] time I look at the scoreboard U I'm I
[01:15:34] can't tell whether the competitors are
[01:15:37] competing for um these mini games or for
[01:15:41] your uh my approval your yeah or your
[01:15:45] heart see I
[01:15:47] see well the last
[01:15:51] match I'm not entirely sure actually so
[01:15:54] I'm going to be surprised here as well
[01:15:56] for the last match I think it might have
[01:15:58] something to do with some
[01:16:01] bosses that's right maybe we'll get to
[01:16:05] see some actual combat happening where
[01:16:08] they'll get to fight
[01:16:10] back it's not just up to
[01:16:12] dodging dodging will be crucial as well
[01:16:15] unless they pick the man the myth the
[01:16:18] legend zongi is the truth but I know
[01:16:21] other than Tonto
[01:16:23] I think psycho maybe as well likes likes
[01:16:26] to use zongi every now and then but I
[01:16:28] know Z and also fob Master don't really
[01:16:32] do much with zong Lee but that is it for

[02:01:03] okay oh you got a little schedule I love
[02:01:05] that so tell me why do you love this
[02:01:06] game so much I'm very much like an art
[02:01:09] and a sex person I love the magic the
[02:01:13] pretty
[02:01:14] ladies and of course um just like the
[02:01:17] the overall like beauty of it it's so
[02:01:21] pretty right okay so your team's winning
[02:01:24] right now but it's close are you feeling
[02:01:26] confident what are you bringing to the
[02:01:28] table I'm bringing to the table moral
[02:01:31] support because I heard my opponents are
[02:01:34] very good and I'm just like okay I'm
[02:01:37] kind of confident but I'm not sure if
[02:01:39] I'm as good as them but I could try my
[02:01:40] best you're going to be fantastic Nico
[02:01:43] we're so happy you're here please take
[02:01:44] your position
[02:01:46] yay woo okay our next special guest is
[02:01:51] grenader Jake joining atsu's unpaid
[02:01:57] employee okay so grenader tell me why do
[02:02:00] you love this game why is genin impact
[02:02:02] the best all right well first I want to
[02:02:04] say you're very tall I'm not I'm not
[02:02:06] this short okay I'm like 65 right now
[02:02:09] it's it's intimidating I got to say but
[02:02:11] all right here's the reason I love
[02:02:12] genjin impact there's two of them okay
[02:02:14] one of the reasons is just there is so
[02:02:16] much to explore like I feel like you
[02:02:18] cannot get bored to this game because
[02:02:19] there's just always new places you
[02:02:21] haven't been new things to see and I
[02:02:23] love that so that's thing number one
[02:02:25] thing number two is the gameplay and how
[02:02:27] you can just swap between characters
[02:02:29] within a second use one ability and then
[02:02:31] use a new character to like gain an
[02:02:33] advantage from that first ability I
[02:02:34] think that's really unique and really
[02:02:36] fun when you start to master it that was
[02:02:38] a fantastic answer I'm like okay I'm
[02:02:41] ready to go now your team is down a
[02:02:45] little bit but you're going to be the
[02:02:46] ringer right you're going to turn things
[02:02:48] around absolutely yeah my 20 years of
[02:02:51] PVP experience is going to be brought to
[02:02:53] this game although maybe not 20 years of
[02:02:55] experience in genin I'm good at PVP so I
[02:02:58] can work with the team I I feel like we

[02:04:30] course the ability to watch all the
[02:04:31] wonderful things that you would like to
[02:04:33] watch on your phones as well so next up
[02:04:35] we have the last mini game incoming
[02:04:37] which is going to be as we teased
[02:04:39] earlier a Boss Rush mhm that's right U
[02:04:44] so unlike the previous matches um this
[02:04:49] one will be the teams will be taking
[02:04:52] turns to fight so I guess we'll decide
[02:04:56] who gets to go first and then we'll get
[02:04:59] to there'll be a spotlight on each team
[02:05:02] and we'll get to see their skills put to
[02:05:04] the very very task and you saw we had
[02:05:07] two new additions to each team we have
[02:05:10] the wonderful Nico joining the atsu's
[02:05:13] neglected children and then on the
[02:05:16] atsu's unpaid employees we also have
[02:05:19] another Jake joining on that team as
[02:05:22] well they will all be streaming as well
[02:05:25] so as you can see we have the new team
[02:05:27] which is tono Zio and Nico no longer
[02:05:31] tooto but now Tonto mhm that's right
[02:05:35] yeah oh and I see looks like Tanto and
[02:05:37] Nico's favorite characters are Mysteries
[02:05:40] but Zio here has um the triple sh triple
[02:05:45] sh that's my type of my type of genon
[02:05:48] streamer spoiler alert tono's favorite
[02:05:50] is Jean Jean Jean and nothing but jean
[02:05:54] all Jean so on the other side we have
[02:05:57] got fob master and of course psycho as
[02:06:00] well and Jake is joining them there
[02:06:03] Adventure rank unknown achievements
[02:06:04] unknown but today maybe Jake will be
[02:06:07] able to gain a new achievement of
[02:06:09] becoming a genin impact Astro Carnival
[02:06:12] Champion very very exciting stuff that's
[02:06:15] right a very very momentous m mil Stone
[02:06:19] very iconic it's not every day that we
[02:06:23] hold these events after all and not
[02:06:25] everyone gets to participate so it's
[02:06:27] very very very exciting so with the boss
[02:06:31] fight I had a sneak preview earlier and
[02:06:33] it seems like they were doing some pics
[02:06:35] and bands for certain characters because
[02:06:38] I'm not sure they know what the bosses
[02:06:39] they're going to be fighting are but I
[02:06:41] saw fob master and psycho strategizing
[02:06:44] what would be the best team comps to run
[02:06:46] into any and all kind of enemies I'm not
[02:06:48] sure zionic and Toronto got much
[02:06:51] strategizing done they're just going
[02:06:52] with the Vibes but we'll see how that
[02:06:55] pays off and ultimately it is going to
[02:06:57] come down to teamwork team Synergy and
[02:06:59] the characters that they have selected
[02:07:01] and hopefully we're going to see the
[02:07:03] ar60 players actually pop off that's
[02:07:07] right so U maybe you can Enlighten some
[02:07:10] of our viewers at home what character
[02:07:13] would you put on a team if you didn't
[02:07:16] know what the enemy lineup was aside
[02:07:19] from zongi okay the safe bet is always
[02:07:22] to go zongi but I think dandro is pretty
[02:07:24] strong right now so I think N is a good
[02:07:27] pick to go of yan as well as always a
[02:07:29] strong pick as well so you have the
[02:07:31] rules on the screen right now for the
[02:07:33] co-op boss fight that's right so all
[02:07:36] three members from both teams will be
[02:07:38] participating there is a time limit of
[02:07:41] 10 minutes that the teams have to defeat
[02:07:43] an open world boss so the weekly bosses
[02:07:46] mhm the boss is difficult it will be
[02:07:49] determined um by the point
[02:07:52] calculation and so we have different
[02:07:55] scorings for each boss based on their
[02:07:57] difficulty bosses where 200 points can
[02:07:59] only be beat once but all other bosses
[02:08:02] are fair game can be beat an unlimited
[02:08:05] amount of times and if you are
[02:08:07] eliminated by the boss so the boss
[02:08:09] crushes you and destroys your entire
[02:08:11] party you then have to move on to the
[02:08:13] very next boss so as you can see here we
[02:08:15] start off with AA followed by rden
[02:08:18] Shogun followed by the wonderer going
[02:08:21] ham a little bit insane but in other
[02:08:24] words so if let's say we have Team
[02:08:27] atsu's neglected children they all wipe
[02:08:29] and get eliminated by asaha they have to
[02:08:31] leave with zero points and they move on
[02:08:32] straight onto the next boss but here we
[02:08:34] go this is the order that they can go in
[02:08:36] for the weekly bosses and then after
[02:08:38] that I believe they can go in any order
[02:08:40] after that that's right that's right and
[02:08:42] we can see uh after the weeklys we have
[02:08:46] uh you know we have a Simon um the ruin
[02:08:49] the ruin worm the geow wolf Lord there's
[02:08:53] a lot of choices here uh I'm really
[02:08:56] curious to see after the weekly they
[02:08:58] even got the B King mhm yeah fun fun
[02:09:02] indeed I don't think these players even
[02:09:05] know where the B King is located so
[02:09:07] they're going to struggle to find that
[02:09:09] one now the best strategy for this if
[02:09:11] they're able to hear me I'm giving them
[02:09:12] a bit of a tip is to find the bosses
[02:09:14] that are nearest to teleporters so you
[02:09:16] can access them quickly cuz some of
[02:09:18] those is take a very very very long time
[02:09:20] to hunt down and after you know
[02:09:23] struggling with cuz I know they're going
[02:09:25] to struggle with the characters and the
[02:09:26] builds that they have right now they're
[02:09:28] going to have to make sure that they are
[02:09:30] coordinating with their time very very
[02:09:32] effectively and efficiently and we do
[02:09:33] have a dendro Hyper blo Team coming
[02:09:38] through here and this is for atsu's
[02:09:40] neglected children team we have alham
[02:09:43] excellent choice we have cookie shinobu
[02:09:45] to start the catalyze reactions and we
[02:09:48] have have also mons net and also Ki so
[02:09:52] this is a very strong team two healers
[02:09:54] two hyper carries I'm excited mhm that's
[02:09:57] right yeah I I'm looking forward to see
[02:10:01] how um because you know this is in Co-op
[02:10:04] so unlike a typical boss fight in single
[02:10:07] player where you have to you know kind
[02:10:09] of plan out your rotations you can only
[02:10:11] have one character on field at a time
[02:10:12] but here they'll be able to do double
[02:10:15] the damage and we do see the damage
[02:10:17] coming through from noet is absolutely
[02:10:20] crazy bear in mind all of these
[02:10:22] characters are constellation 6 we need
[02:10:25] some healing coming through here cookie
[02:10:26] shoba of course in corp is an excellent
[02:10:29] choice because she is able to heal
[02:10:30] everyone at the same time likewise with
[02:10:33] kokomi as well very very good picks here
[02:10:36] and we have the two hyper carries of
[02:10:38] alham and noet with the hyper Bloom
[02:10:40] coming through as well for that extra
[02:10:42] damage as well but noet at constellation
[02:10:45] 6 the damage is just wow look at that
[02:10:47] damage
[02:10:48] con 30,000 30,000,000
[02:10:52] and I believe we're in oh did someone
[02:10:55] just wipe then no no no I think we are
[02:10:57] still good to go we have the Alam and
[02:11:00] cooki shinobu is being controlled by I
[02:11:01] believe Tanto is controlling both of
[02:11:04] those two and I think we have Nico on
[02:11:07] kakomi and I believe net is being
[02:11:10] controlled by Z right now mhm they're
[02:11:14] going back in after waiting for um the
[02:11:17] elements to be changed it is a little
[02:11:19] unfortunate that when you know asaha
[02:11:22] goes into his invulnerable state in
[02:11:23] between changing the different phases
[02:11:25] the different
[02:11:27] elements and I do know as well that it's
[02:11:30] kind of annoying when this tail this
[02:11:32] phase comes up or not the tail the tree
[02:11:34] because even when his HP goes down to
[02:11:37] zero you have to wait for the tree to go
[02:11:39] away and we get our first completion
[02:11:41] there in 1 minute 46 seconds clocking in
[02:11:45] a reasonably fast time they are now
[02:11:47] going to head over straight to the next
[02:11:49] boss which I believe is going to be the
[02:11:51] Ryden Shogun we are seeing toono
[02:11:53] locating it now end of onic emia so this
[02:11:56] should be very very very interesting
[02:11:58] this boss is very difficult and it's
[02:12:00] very possible they are going to all be
[02:12:03] wiped out here so here we go I do see
[02:12:06] you know shobu is looking a little on
[02:12:09] life support yeah she does go down to
[02:12:12] very low HP when she heals and you don't
[02:12:14] stay on her herself cuz she does cut her
[02:12:16] own hit points but at constellation six
[02:12:18] she does have the ability to survive one
[02:12:22] killer hit so maybe we'll see that in
[02:12:24] action that's true that's true and
[02:12:26] another good thing about shobu as well
[02:12:28] for those who don't know um is that the
[02:12:30] lower her HP goes I believe the more em
[02:12:33] indeed she gets so that helps to
[02:12:35] contribute to her damage lots of damage
[02:12:38] coming through here right now I know you
[02:12:39] guys can't see the HP bar but judging by
[02:12:41] this damage it's a lot it's a lot of
[02:12:43] damage coming through and ideally these
[02:12:47] guys want to avoid void the enemy or
[02:12:49] rather Ryden from entering her stronger
[02:12:52] State here her God form and it's
[02:12:56] probably really close I can't see how
[02:12:58] close it ising they are wailing on her
[02:13:00] right now she is staggered we have the
[02:13:02] elemental burst coming through oh they
[02:13:04] completely already wow that was really
[02:13:06] really really fast coming in at around 1
[02:13:08] minute or so as well maybe 1 and a half
[02:13:10] minutes or so very very quick time there
[02:13:13] and they are blasting through they have
[02:13:15] gone with a very strong composition once
[02:13:16] again two hyper carries on the field
[02:13:18] bear in mind in cop the enemies have
[02:13:20] increased damage and increased HP at the
[02:13:22] same time as well so it is a little bit
[02:13:24] risky if you go for the squishier
[02:13:26] characters but I think they are looking
[02:13:29] very strong team at's neglected
[02:13:32] children another thing too out to that
[02:13:34] I've noticed is you know you have koki
[02:13:36] who you want to scale HP to maximize her
[02:13:38] healing you also have nuvet his attack
[02:13:41] or rather his damage scales off of HP as
[02:13:44] well so you have these characters that
[02:13:46] are pretty tanky and can take a lot but
[02:13:49] they're also pretty good at dealing
[02:13:51] damage yeah the double Hydro here giving
[02:13:54] extra HP as well to net increasing his
[02:13:57] damage increasing his tankiness it's
[02:13:58] mostly Al ha that they just need to keep
[02:14:00] alive he is the squishier one although I
[02:14:01] do see has 23,000 HP so the double Hydro
[02:14:05] selection here with the hydro resonance
[02:14:06] giving everyone extra HP is a smart
[02:14:09] choice once again I know you guys can't
[02:14:10] see the HP right now of the enemy but
[02:14:13] he's down already and we're on to the
[02:14:16] next phase within 30 seconds or so very
[02:14:19] very very quick now will they be able to
[02:14:21] coordinate the the little what what what
[02:14:24] are the like energy bombs that come out
[02:14:27] and take down wer here or scar rather I
[02:14:30] should say MH right so so far they are
[02:14:34] going to try and open up a safe area
[02:14:37] here okay there's one there's one energy
[02:14:39] bomb there's two here comes a stop get
[02:14:41] rid of the bomb so that they can
[02:14:43] maximize their energy everyone's still
[02:14:45] looking healthy on HP on the side lines
[02:14:48] there you can see on the side
[02:14:50] there The Shield you can you can just
[02:14:53] about see it under the timer The Shield
[02:14:55] is being depleted and we have one of the
[02:14:58] big bombs landing on Scaro here they are
[02:15:01] collecting they are coordinating very
[02:15:03] very good this makes me very excited to
[02:15:04] see how fob and Dawn and Jake fa in
[02:15:08] comparison for sure I feel like there is
[02:15:11] kind of an advantage in the team that
[02:15:13] goes second because you can see what
[02:15:16] strategy the other team is in play
[02:15:18] they have already locked in their
[02:15:19] characters though so oh he's
[02:15:22] down he's about to enter his
[02:15:25] pH okay can they collect the bombs in
[02:15:29] time the Nirvana engine summoned by
[02:15:32] shami to generate the energy blocks are
[02:15:34] they able to destroy these in time oh
[02:15:36] this will be a little trick it's all
[02:15:37] down to net because there is no reach
[02:15:40] from the other characters our heam can
[02:15:42] use his Elemental skill to get up and
[02:15:43] hit and maybe plunge attack to take down
[02:15:46] once oh no n not able to charge his
[02:15:48] attacks here yeah net is a hyro type
[02:15:52] they have oh we going to see an
[02:15:53] elimination here we do get one of the
[02:15:54] plung attacks down there's still two
[02:15:56] more bombs how much time do they have
[02:15:59] remaining before one of them is about to
[02:16:00] get one shot eliminated here I don't
[02:16:02] think they have enough
[02:16:03] time oh set the sh met
[02:16:07] come oh
[02:16:09] no oh no it's j it's
[02:16:14] j it's Jo and we see net going down one
[02:16:18] of the strongest characters on the team
[02:16:20] now the the DPS is going to drop
[02:16:23] massively it's all down to our they do
[02:16:25] need to keep them alive otherwise they
[02:16:27] only have two healers to take on the the
[02:16:30] scar boss boss fight
[02:16:33] here so Z going down here oh no oh the
[02:16:38] momentum has shifted tremendously with
[02:16:41] that monst never let the damage has
[02:16:43] dropped off massively they do need to
[02:16:45] get the spread and aggravates and
[02:16:47] quickens off
[02:16:48] ASAP but the the enemy is just moving
[02:16:50] around flying around the screen all the
[02:16:52] time they are very much relying on the
[02:16:55] The Companions here to do the damage for
[02:16:57] them exactly yeah ooh okay still they're
[02:17:01] still looking healthy the rest of the
[02:17:02] team is still looking healthy some big
[02:17:04] damage coming through there and they
[02:17:06] have the Finish there they only have
[02:17:08] just under 3 minutes remaining and the
[02:17:11] next boss is going to be the most
[02:17:13] recently released weekly boss they are
[02:17:17] going in the wrong place they they do
[02:17:19] not know where to look it's in fontain
[02:17:22] the boss is in no it's in sumaru sorry
[02:17:24] it's in
[02:17:26] sumaru oh no that's not it that's not it
[02:17:29] no that Tanto does not know where to go
[02:17:32] for the new weekly
[02:17:33] boss he's clueless ar60 he's wasting
[02:17:38] time he has no idea where to go for the
[02:17:41] new weekly boss oh no no no Z is trying
[02:17:45] to help him but Z is clueless as well
[02:17:48] oh no team a is neglected CH it's not oh
[02:17:53] it looks like it actually not unlocked
[02:17:55] oh apparently it's not unlocked for
[02:17:58] them oh
[02:18:01] no I believe we have a slight technical
[02:18:04] issue here so we're going to go straight
[02:18:05] to laora we are going to skip over the
[02:18:07] dandro or rather the new weekly bosses
[02:18:10] sumaru apologies but let's switch over
[02:18:14] to
[02:18:16] laora
[02:18:18] in all honesty I do feel like this does
[02:18:20] work out for this team because that boss
[02:18:22] in sumaru takes a lot of time it does
[02:18:26] take a long time three phases and I
[02:18:29] believe it is um the longest boss to
[02:18:32] fight because you have that phase in the
[02:18:34] Middle where you have to it's it's kind
[02:18:36] of like scripted you have to protect
[02:18:39] that the seed in the middle indeed that
[02:18:41] would have been too challenging for the
[02:18:43] neglected children for sure okay we have
[02:18:46] Lora we have Net who's a little bit low
[02:18:48] on HP but has been revived they can heal
[02:18:51] him up for sure here lots of damage
[02:18:53] coming through will they be able to get
[02:18:56] SORA beaten in less than a minute oh
[02:18:59] already oh they do not have any pyro so
[02:19:01] they are going to have to rely on the
[02:19:02] butterflies here the butterflies are
[02:19:04] struggling to find them they're going
[02:19:06] they're chasing the same ones The Shield
[02:19:08] is only a little bit down I don't think
[02:19:11] they're going to make this we have toono
[02:19:13] here attacking the shield instead of
[02:19:14] going for the butterflies the wrong play
[02:19:16] here
[02:19:18] the sheer cold coming in and chipping
[02:19:20] away at the HP they are not taking down
[02:19:22] the shield right now okay is down to
[02:19:24] half they only have 30 seconds remaining
[02:19:25] I don't think they have enough time to
[02:19:27] to eliminate Lora here she is still in
[02:19:29] her Shield form unfortunately it doesn't
[02:19:31] matter what constellation of character
[02:19:33] is if you have an elemental Shield
[02:19:36] exactly okay here we go The Shield
[02:19:38] should go down can they do it in 10
[02:19:40] seconds do they have enough damage never
[02:19:41] mind The Shield is not going down
[02:19:43] where's the coordination why are you
[02:19:44] super conducting The Shield that's a
[02:19:46] butterfly behind you there's a butterfly
[02:19:48] right there five four 3 2 1 it's all
[02:19:54] over now 600 points on the board it's
[02:19:58] all over now I don't think they had
[02:20:00] enough damage regardless good showing
[02:20:02] though good showing ASA performance was
[02:20:04] great a very unfortunate miscalculation
[02:20:07] with the scar boss fight in that they
[02:20:09] did not have enough aerial attacks to
[02:20:12] take down the floating bombs that they
[02:20:14] needed to eliminate that's right it I
[02:20:17] think that uh you know dendro and Hyper
[02:20:20] Bloom is really really strong but
[02:20:22] against a boss like that a boss with a
[02:20:23] lot of Elemental Shields um yeah it's
[02:20:27] unfortunate if you don't have any pyro
[02:20:28] or cryo they did not see it coming
[02:20:30] Unfortunately they did lose a lot of
[02:20:32] time when nlet went down a lot of that
[02:20:34] damage disappeared when they were taking
[02:20:36] on Scara mush and I believe we have next
[02:20:40] up is going to be F master and psycho
[02:20:43] they are also prepping and loading up
[02:20:45] right now so once again I believe they
[02:20:47] had 600 points for team atus neglected
[02:20:50] children and we have a raffle on the way
[02:20:53] as well for more of these wonderful
[02:20:55] OnePlus phones as well and this time you
[02:20:58] will want to be checking out instead of
[02:20:59] the Astra Carnival chat we are going to
[02:21:01] take Astra Carnival the keyword over to
[02:21:04] the channels of
[02:21:06] twitch.tv/ n NE KO and twitch.tv/ boxbox
[02:21:10] box box surely you guys can spell that
[02:21:14] and a slightly more difficult one I

[02:21:19] name
[02:21:21] [Music]
[02:21:22] twitch.tv/ I believe it's g e r n a d e

[02:22:24] hopefully someone from my community and
[02:22:26] Winnie's Community will be taking home
[02:22:28] some wonderful OnePlus phones so very
[02:22:30] very exciting stuff now what do you make
[02:22:34] of Team axu neglected children and their
[02:22:37] performance honestly I would say it was
[02:22:39] a very solid start I know AA is really
[02:22:43] hard to fight without a shield and they
[02:22:45] didn't have that but they did have the
[02:22:46] double healing so they had really good
[02:22:48] sustain but
[02:22:50] unfortunately yeah as time went on it
[02:22:53] just looked like the hyper Bloom team
[02:22:55] was not going to cut it and you know
[02:22:58] hyper Bloom has its pros and cons uh but
[02:23:02] there are just times where it doesn't
[02:23:04] work and we've seen two of those times
[02:23:07] yeah we have we have seen especially
[02:23:10] when the hydro character goes down it
[02:23:13] makes things a lot more complicated
[02:23:14] especially when the alham is not putting
[02:23:16] out the craziest damage in the world we
[02:23:19] did see the net constantly hitting
[02:23:20] 30,000 30,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 so
[02:23:24] the damage was going through very very
[02:23:27] very quickly and very strongly and I
[02:23:29] believe we've gone for a very similar
[02:23:31] team here forat who's unplayed employee
[02:23:33] but we have a favorite character here in
[02:23:36] the team they have opted for the king
[02:23:39] himself zong Lee that's right zongi is a
[02:23:43] player's best friend in my opinion if
[02:23:45] you have issues with dodging and no
[02:23:48] shame to anyone because I also have
[02:23:51] issues with dodging inde so we have I'm
[02:23:54] not sure who's controlling the two
[02:23:56] characters here for the Quicken and
[02:23:58] cataliz reactions we do have shoa and
[02:24:01] together so once to get another dandroid
[02:24:03] Electro cook shobu is Electro character
[02:24:05] net is also the same big damage coming
[02:24:07] through from net again you see the
[02:24:09] 47,000 there the 32,000 coming through
[02:24:11] very strong another constellation six
[02:24:13] noet as well but this time we have zongi
[02:24:16] who does provide a shield I believe if
[02:24:18] this is a C6 zly it should be a shield
[02:24:20] to everyone should he have his ultimate
[02:24:22] and his Elemental burst but by himself
[02:24:26] it's only a shield for himself and if
[02:24:28] it's only a shield for himself that's
[02:24:30] still a little bit dangerous so I'm I'm
[02:24:33] intrigued to see what they're going to
[02:24:34] plan to do here we do see the net with
[02:24:36] some big damage and everyone does have
[02:24:38] the shield here as you can see so it is
[02:24:40] a zly that has at least constellation I
[02:24:42] believe it's constellation six so we got
[02:24:45] protection we got damage we got healing
[02:24:47] we got healing as well C Shield heals
[02:24:50] you as well when you take damage so
[02:24:52] that's also very very
[02:24:54] cool I think Nita here instead of the
[02:24:56] Alan is interesting choice it does
[02:24:58] increase the reaction damages that you
[02:25:00] will be seeing from all of the
[02:25:02] characters the is also I would say
[02:25:04] requires a little bit less skill cuz you
[02:25:06] just hold your e and you just scan the
[02:25:07] opponent look at that damage coming
[02:25:09] through from net 47,000 47,000 they are
[02:25:13] wailing on the tail here but once again
[02:25:14] the tail has a fixed timer you got wait
[02:25:17] for the TA to to disappear and asaha to
[02:25:20] resurface and then you can eliminate
[02:25:23] him seeing a lot of uh jumping and
[02:25:26] dodging here indeed and we have on the
[02:25:30] clock 1 minute 40 or rather 1 minute 38
[02:25:33] seconds or so Elemental burst used at
[02:25:35] the end there that might be costly
[02:25:38] because they have just lost the shield
[02:25:41] and they are going to have to charge up
[02:25:42] their Elemental burst once again for the
[02:25:44] Ryden so the zly burst there may have
[02:25:47] been that could cost them Ryden does
[02:25:50] have a lot of damage and if they and the
[02:25:52] thing I'm slightly worried about is I
[02:25:54] don't know if they have enough damage to
[02:25:55] eliminate Ryan's shield in time or
[02:25:58] rather eliminate Ryden before she puts
[02:26:00] her shield on cuz once that Shield is on
[02:26:03] there's going to be a lot of difficulty
[02:26:04] exactly there's a lot of uh down or
[02:26:07] rather time that's needed to get the
[02:26:09] shield back down get the shield back
[02:26:11] down damage gets reduced massively on
[02:26:13] the enemy we start off with all the
[02:26:15] elements of burst coming through here
[02:26:16] then the zong Le big damage coming
[02:26:19] through they are very much ring on net
[02:26:21] being very accurate with his skill with
[02:26:24] his ability to hit the enemy we see a
[02:26:26] lot I see a 54,000 damage hit there
[02:26:29] that's a lot of damage they are wailing
[02:26:30] they're just wailing on Ryden right now
[02:26:33] so much damage coming through from net
[02:26:34] 75,000 from the it's over already wow
[02:26:38] that was so so so fast and looks like
[02:26:41] they might possibly as long as they down
[02:26:43] the scar here within the next 2 3
[02:26:45] minutes or so they are going to
[02:26:46] obliterate team atsu's neglected
[02:26:49] children however we know what happened
[02:26:52] last time maybe they will also not have
[02:26:56] enough aerial damage because they only
[02:26:58] have net I'm not sure n scanning can
[02:27:02] eliminate those Hy not the hydro the
[02:27:05] bombs the the oh yes that's the hold
[02:27:07] skill I'm not 100% sure the hold skill
[02:27:10] can actually Target those the normal tap
[02:27:12] skill can hit those but I don't know if
[02:27:14] the range is high enough is a for to hit
[02:27:19] those bombs but I don't want to tell the
[02:27:21] team I do want to Str a little bit so
[02:27:23] we'll see if they're able to work it out
[02:27:26] but here we
[02:27:27] go we charging right in they are just
[02:27:31] going to whale again net coming through
[02:27:33] showing that he is a very strong pick 27
[02:27:36] 20,000 to 37,000 yeah the elemental
[02:27:39] burst from zi providing a shield as
[02:27:42] well it's it's about to go down any
[02:27:44] moment now I'm sure the damage is there
[02:27:47] also hitting a fair amount of damage
[02:27:49] constant 10,000 10,000 and that's
[02:27:50] without crits we enter the next phase
[02:27:54] already and now we have all of the
[02:27:57] little companions here Everlasting Lord
[02:28:00] of Arcane wisdom saying I am the all
[02:28:02] knowing god going up against zong Le
[02:28:05] going up against n going up against win
[02:28:08] win n as well so let's see who is the
[02:28:12] real God here The Shield is going down
[02:28:14] relatively at a okay Pace right now they
[02:28:17] do need to eliminate some of these to
[02:28:18] unlock some bombs to help break their
[02:28:20] Shield as
[02:28:23] well all right here we go still looking
[02:28:27] very good Shield is down to around half
[02:28:30] and I'm very sure once The Shield is
[02:28:33] down they are going to absolutely
[02:28:35] annihilate him as long as they are able
[02:28:38] to avoid Scar's strongest heavy attack
[02:28:42] that's right which we're seeing right
[02:28:45] now we have F Master taking some very
[02:28:48] interesting angles here to attack with
[02:28:50] the large colossal ball
[02:28:54] here okay The Shield is down it's
[02:28:57] payback time achievement
[02:29:00] unlocked is there enough coordination
[02:29:02] with the net cuz once again net cannot
[02:29:04] instantly fire off his charge attacks
[02:29:09] unless oh I think I think Bob knows Bob
[02:29:12] knows about the charge attacks with Nita
[02:29:14] they are able to actually eliminate
[02:29:17] these aial
[02:29:18] bombs he's got two can he get the third
[02:29:22] one oh she's running out of stamina oh
[02:29:24] they also do have zongi that they could
[02:29:26] climb up the pillars on and directly hit
[02:29:28] them but I think they're good to go it's
[02:29:30] done it's over at the 420 Mark we see
[02:29:36] Team atsu's unemployed or atsu's unpaid
[02:29:40] employees are about to obliterate Scaro
[02:29:45] here 5,000 damage coming through
[02:29:49] 63,000 wow 4 minutes remaining to take
[02:29:53] on
[02:29:55] Lora oh no I think we have our winners
[02:29:59] here possibly maybe they can take it a
[02:30:02] little bit easy you know play with their
[02:30:04] food we'll see we'll see what they
[02:30:07] decide to do
[02:30:09] here so we have fob Master psycho and
[02:30:13] Jake with three minut oh they're just
[02:30:16] they're just taking their time now they
[02:30:18] have 3 minutes 30 seconds to defeat Lora
[02:30:21] and win the whole entire
[02:30:25] competition but will we see them run
[02:30:27] into the same
[02:30:29] problem they do not have pyro yeah but
[02:30:32] if they as long as they're able to get
[02:30:34] the butterflies it shouldn't be a
[02:30:36] problem do they have the coordination
[02:30:39] for that
[02:30:42] though it's looking very very solid now
[02:30:45] it's already inry form as long as they
[02:30:48] take the
[02:30:49] butterflies they have a good 2 and 1
[02:30:51] half minutes to eliminate Lora they are
[02:30:54] trying to avoid dying from the shear
[02:30:56] cold though so she cold is something
[02:30:58] chipping away at them the shields are
[02:31:00] there as well got to be careful with the
[02:31:02] Kush Elemental skill to not eliminate
[02:31:04] the Butterfly by
[02:31:07] mistake okay half of The Shield is
[02:31:12] [Music]
[02:31:14] down two three three more hits
[02:31:18] perhaps two more Hits and The Shield
[02:31:20] should go down and they will have 2
[02:31:23] minutes over 2 minutes to finish last
[02:31:26] what about zong zong is on oh Z is
[02:31:29] almost perished oh no zongi is a life
[02:31:32] support there oh he's healed back up
[02:31:35] he's okay Z is
[02:31:38] okay and with the C6 The Shield will
[02:31:41] heal the zongi back up as well oh the
[02:31:43] damage is absolutely insane already
[02:31:46] forcing Lora to go into the Pyro tornado
[02:31:49] for was he 6 oh it's over it's over he
[02:31:53] only took me seconds they have they have
[02:31:56] 2 minutes remaining on the clock when
[02:31:58] they have finished Lora boss they're
[02:32:01] just toying with the Enemy now they're
[02:32:02] just mocking them they're going for the
[02:32:04] next boss the Calia boss fight they're
[02:32:07] just flexing they don't even need to
[02:32:09] take down this boss to take home the W
[02:32:11] but they just want to Pummel their
[02:32:12] opponents into the ground no mercy
[02:32:15] coming through from atsu's unpaid
[02:32:19] employees they're trying to earn their
[02:32:21] paycheck here OPP and they're showing
[02:32:23] off with it would you say they're doing
[02:32:25] a good job ABS they're doing a great job
[02:32:27] but no one more fitting to eliminate
[02:32:29] than Talia one of the wealthiest
[02:32:31] characters in genin Impact as we have
[02:32:34] seen from the story Quest or the Aron
[02:32:36] Quest he's got that he's got that very
[02:32:38] very large
[02:32:39] purse and I believe the first phase is
[02:32:42] already down it's already down and we
[02:32:44] have one minute left here and this this
[02:32:46] this boss is going to go down in mere
[02:32:49] seconds I I give him 10 more seconds at
[02:32:52] most to
[02:32:54] survive we can't see the HP but he's
[02:32:57] down he is that is he down yet no all
[02:33:00] three 2 one is's down he's down he's
[02:33:04] gone are they going to really go for an
[02:33:06] extra boss I have 40 seconds remaining
[02:33:08] are they going to make it they all have
[02:33:09] to T it together they can pick any of
[02:33:11] the bosses I think they are
[02:33:13] still are they are they going to go for
[02:33:15] him they are going to go for him I I
[02:33:18] don't think they they can do this if
[02:33:20] they can do this it will be absolutely
[02:33:22] incredible they all have to teleport to
[02:33:24] the right place
[02:33:26] together 20 seconds remaining ah they're
[02:33:28] going to get there the BS is going to
[02:33:30] start and it's going to be time over but
[02:33:33] they have already gained
[02:33:36] 980 points
[02:33:38] M and even if the travel time didn't
[02:33:40] count we know that you know this boss is
[02:33:42] very susceptible to both dendro and
[02:33:44] Electro which they have it would have
[02:33:47] gone down very quickly five more seconds
[02:33:49] are they going to do it I don't think
[02:33:50] they're going to do it that's time
[02:33:53] almost almost they got it down to half
[02:33:55] HP but wow they're going for the the
[02:33:57] finish the a they wanted that Flex there
[02:34:00] we saw at the end that they did finish
[02:34:01] it off but well done to team atsu's

[02:35:10] fob master and psychos team they're
[02:35:11] going to be the same as well maybe once
[02:35:13] again another special guest tomorrow as
[02:35:15] well the times are on all of our social
[02:35:18] medias so make sure to check we do have
[02:35:21] the Raffle winners on the way as well
[02:35:23] that should appear on the screen any
[02:35:25] moment now but if you are looking for
[02:35:27] the time oh there we have the Raffle
[02:35:28] winners and our two winners are running
[02:35:33] Rhythm and Chiefs congratul
[02:35:36] congratulations enjoy the OnePlus
[02:35:39] PHS so yes tomorrow we will be going
[02:35:43] live a lot earlier I believe it's it's
[02:35:46] around I I want to say 10 10:30 PT
[02:35:52] Pacific time and that's 10:30 thank you
[02:35:55] Jackie and we have the point
[02:35:57] calculations on the way although I think
[02:35:59] we we all know who's won here I think we
[02:36:02] all know who's won here however I'm not
[02:36:05] 100% certain but maybe these points
[02:36:06] carry over into day too possibly to
[02:36:09] tomorrow tomorrow
[02:36:11] possibly but regardless it's going to be
[02:36:13] an interesting competition whether or
[02:36:15] not we do have a crowning winner today
[02:36:17] we have more games in store for you guys
[02:36:19] tomorrow so it is day one we do have the
[02:36:22] points here oh well it's it's a pretty
[02:36:24] substantial Gap here
[02:36:27] wow so I believe it's 375 Point
[02:36:31] difference
[02:36:32] now which is quite a lot now my mental
[02:36:37] match might be incorrect here but I do
[02:36:38] believe it is 375 Point difference here
[02:36:40] they were previously ahead by five
[02:36:43] points and then atsu's unpaid employees
[02:36:45] gain three 380 points on them so surely
[02:36:47] it is
[02:36:48] 375 that's my calculations guys okay
[02:36:51] justify me okay I I hope I hope my match
[02:36:54] was correct but yes that's played
[02:36:56] employees also won basically every match
[02:36:59] today except for the second match so
[02:37:03] that's uh that is quite a big Point Gap
[02:37:06] I wonder if they are able to clor their
[02:37:08] way back later on tomorrow I still think
[02:37:11] it's anyone's game you know it's not
[02:37:12] over till it's over that is my motto so
[02:37:17] so yeah we have the winners looking very
[02:37:21] very happy right now the losers looking
[02:37:25] a little bit disappointed the host is
[02:37:27] preparing we have Jackie preparing to
[02:37:29] interview the winners in a moment look
[02:37:31] at the losers on camera here look at
[02:37:33] them look at
[02:37:35] them a it's okay okay we have we have uh
[02:37:39] interviews coming through I believe with
[02:37:41] the losing team and the winning team as
[02:37:43] well it'll be great to hear the thoughts
[02:37:46] from both sides yeah we we'll understand
[02:37:48] what went through their brains at
[02:37:50] certain points of disaster because there
[02:37:53] was a lot of disaster there was
[02:37:54] disasters in the Maze there was
[02:37:56] disasters in the race there was
[02:37:58] disasters in the Boss Rush they were all
[02:38:00] over the place both teams all over the
[02:38:02] place at certain periods of time we have
[02:38:05] a wild zionic there appearing as you can
[02:38:07] see is very short wellu did you do you
[02:38:10] think that you saw ar60 gameplay
[02:38:13] today wow honestly
[02:38:17] speaking we saw questionable ar60
[02:38:20] gameplay
[02:38:22] today so hopefully we will hear some
[02:38:26] reassuring words from the Champions the
[02:38:30] winners of uh their own ar60
[02:38:33] performances cuz they even though they
[02:38:36] did win it was a little bit questionable
[02:38:37] all the way up until the Boss Rush they
[02:38:39] did Flex their muscles in the Boss Rush
[02:38:41] and show they knew exactly what they
[02:38:42] were
[02:38:44] doing apologies F Master with the charge
[02:38:47] attacks which was the differential in
[02:38:49] the scar boss fight as well you know
[02:38:52] people don't give him credit for being
[02:38:53] as smart as he is so so we are going to
[02:38:56] head over to Jackie who I believe is
[02:38:59] with the winners so thank you so much
[02:39:02] for having us today and we are going to
[02:39:04] send you all over to
