[00:13:23] probably gonna go to twitchcon and
[00:13:25] there might be something happening that
[00:13:27] I might be
[00:13:30] a part of but I don't know what I can
[00:13:32] talk about yet so I'm gonna shut up but
[00:13:34] yes so we'll see
[00:13:36] I checked I'm very last minute because I
[00:13:38] don't know if I wanted to go also I'm
[00:13:40] looking at Chad but not people are
[00:13:41] typing the word so I'm gonna stop
[00:13:42] looking at chat I noticed people okay I
[00:13:44] saw someone type alarm but it can't
[00:13:46] because R is not there so it's fine but
[00:13:48] uh for twitchcon dude a ticket from here
[00:13:50] to [ __ ] Vegas it's like they're all
[00:13:53] the good ones are sold out it's like a
[00:13:54] [ __ ] 12 hour with like six layovers
[00:13:57] and [ __ ] you have to go ride a camel
[00:13:59] and cross through a [ __ ] River so I
[00:14:01] don't know how I'm gonna get there but
[00:14:02] it is what it is uh let's do the Wordle
[00:14:03] uh Let's do let's guess we creamed let's
[00:14:06] pound cream pound we know what this word
[00:14:09] is it's Dairy nope there's no R it's
[00:14:12] Daisy
[00:14:15] dude that would have been sick that
[00:14:16] actually would have been sick actually
[00:14:17] you guys dally
[00:14:20] I I didn't I didn't my voices fight
[00:14:22] Daffy da
[00:14:26] da
[00:14:27] Davey
[00:14:29] Daddy no way
[00:14:34] didn't have yet no
[00:14:37] well right on time
[00:14:39] we're out of time guys if you guys wanna
[00:14:41] something flexible there's so much you
[00:14:42] can do usually I recommend an electro
[00:14:44] support to electrocharge and then
[00:14:46] someone like Jeong LI or
[00:14:50] yeah so if you don't know speaking of
[00:14:52] daddy my never let guide is out
[00:14:54] um very I'm actually super proud of this
[00:14:56] because when I did this
[00:14:58] it was actually early for like when I
[00:15:00] looked at what other Navy live videos
[00:15:01] were out they were all like 12 to 15
[00:15:03] minutes mine 30. I'm like [ __ ] it
[00:15:05] usually I try to trim them lower whereas
[00:15:06] like this character is complex and I
[00:15:08] feel like a lot of people are gonna name
[00:15:09] him so they're appreciating more info so
[00:15:10] I went into so much detail dude I don't
[00:15:12] even did dude I literally mentioned I
[00:15:15] literally mentioned that the charge time
[00:15:16] is one second but you can insta cancel
[00:15:18] it I found this out instantly dude look
[00:15:20] look do you know that you probably knew
[00:15:21] that you can cancel instantly sheesh
[00:15:24] anyways the only things I wish I added
[00:15:26] is uh I talked about heart of depth four
[00:15:29] piece but it's not in the video so maybe
[00:15:30] I edited it out maybe I just mentioned
[00:15:32] the two I don't know so I um like I
[00:15:35] showed it on screen so it's like not a
[00:15:36] big deal but I should talk about it more
[00:15:37] and I felt really bad about that not
[00:15:39] that it matters because gomatic should
[00:15:40] say who the [ __ ] cares but uh because I
[00:15:42] felt out of it there's a pop-up that
[00:15:44] shows up when we talk about it and it
[00:15:45] says you can't see it right now but it
[00:15:46] usually says uh 400 death is also
[00:15:49] survival option and it links to artifact
[00:15:50] calcs I didn't know you could do this
[00:15:52] and now I figured out so if there's ever
[00:15:53] something I want to add I can do this
[00:15:54] now which is [ __ ] sick because now
[00:15:56] I'm less stressed about forgetting
[00:15:57] something boom so that's cool uh and the
[00:16:00] only other thing which I completely
[00:16:01] mentioned but I just added because I was
[00:16:03] like by the way if you if you like you
[00:16:05] want a free-to-play team and you're like
[00:16:06] I don't have cos version
[00:16:08] um you can just go Beto and official and
[00:16:10] I think the taser team of double
[00:16:11] electric is really good I like showed it
[00:16:13] in the video but I didn't like super
[00:16:14] talk about it because the video is super
[00:16:15] long so I had to trim the team section
[00:16:16] but I just figured I should mention it
[00:16:19] again
[00:16:19] but I really [ __ ] like this character
[00:16:21] so yeah
[00:16:22] really really like them
[00:16:24] better get a Chad yeah Beto is the goat
[00:16:30] I wonder if I should um turn on the
[00:16:31] music turn down your face I'm sorry I
[00:16:34] will turn it down
[00:16:37] okay
[00:16:39] you actually not said Elemental skill
[00:16:41] instead of chargeback at 5 57. did I
[00:16:45] I mean it it happens I wanted to mention
[00:16:47] that you really want to make sure you
[00:16:48] actually charge up his Elemental skill
[00:16:49] and don't accidentally cancel it oh yeah
[00:16:51] I mean yeah droplets which is what I
[00:16:54] recommend but you know what I mean then
[00:16:56] cancel it before it's done charging I
[00:16:57] also here when I was editing
[00:16:59] um I said e instead of three or some
[00:17:02] [ __ ] and then I just like put it on
[00:17:03] screen
[00:17:10] is it gonna show something [ __ ] it [ __ ]
[00:17:12] it please don't leak something please
[00:17:18] it's loading
[00:17:19] oh no I can show it okay
[00:17:22] um
[00:17:24] foreign
[00:17:31] snuck it in but then I was like okay he
[00:17:33] snuck it in around time I was like I
[00:17:35] should put at 16 18. I put it at the
[00:17:37] second frame of 1618 but in the YouTube
[00:17:40] player it shows 16 17. so I I guess for
[00:17:44] now I have to put it like deeper in the
[00:17:45] 16 18 like 16 like halfway through I put
[00:17:47] it the first [ __ ] frame or second one
[00:17:49] technically and it shows 16 17 so
[00:17:52] unlucky unlucky
[00:17:54] um that's what it is I guess that's what
[00:17:57] it is
[00:18:01] oh my story opened wait should I check
[00:18:04] the mail you guys said

[00:49:03] why did dotore's favorite test subject
[00:49:05] just have the audacity to sub
[00:49:11] I'm gonna call the authorities on you
[00:49:19] I'm gonna call the authority
[00:49:26] there is one bad stat there is there are
[00:49:29] three good stats
[00:49:32] two of which are crit
[00:49:34] and one bad one
[00:49:40] can this even be good
[00:49:41] what's the best this could be now it
[00:49:43] could have three crit rolls
[00:49:45] I mean it could be fine but I have
[00:49:48] better already
[00:49:53] oh I need to level uh I need to level I
[00:49:56] need to level some of these golden true
[00:49:57] pieces
[00:50:07] for who
[00:50:14] I can tell you but then you'd have to be
[00:50:16] eliminated in game
[00:50:18] will you have to be dealt with
[00:50:27] it
[00:50:29] no actually no one in mind but like dude
[00:50:31] it's a new set it's literally a new set
[00:50:33] dude it's the new set okay I need the
[00:50:35] new set
[00:50:41] for reference in case anyone's wondering
[00:50:43] my marriage
[00:50:48] looks like this
[00:50:49] pretty not bad okay this is a good piece
[00:50:52] okay this is gonna be at peace okay this
[00:50:54] is gonna be at peace and then uh pretty
[00:50:56] good Circle too my goals and Troop looks
[00:50:59] like [ __ ] em Central
[00:51:02] or or [ __ ] attack present Central
[00:51:04] it's not bad it's okay but like what the
[00:51:07] [ __ ] is this
[00:51:10] 63 86 84 75 82 40.
[00:51:16] 35 well I mean this one's whatever
[00:51:24] two Electro sets on agaveth on set shut
[00:51:27] up I mean sure but like dude I can only
[00:51:30] play aggravate official or aggravate
[00:51:32] yeah a Mikko that's it
[00:51:35] but I mean I guess that's fine but also
[00:51:37] like [ __ ] you
[00:51:39] why am I taking my anger out on you you
[00:51:40] did nothing I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:51:44] I'm sorry
[00:51:47] you did nothing wrong
[00:51:54] would you sell your soul for something
[00:51:55] you want no
[00:51:57] unless it's a 50 crit value piece if if
[00:52:00] you ask me between my Humanity or or or
[00:52:04] or or or or or or or or or
[00:52:06] this sense it would be a tough choice
[00:52:09] I'm not telling you I would pick the
[00:52:11] artifact I'm just saying it would be a
[00:52:13] tough choice
[00:52:14] foreign
[00:52:23] no I'm not gonna go that far
[00:52:25] sucks your first no I'm not gonna go
[00:52:27] that far
[00:52:31] all right let's go kill this uh this
[00:52:33] monster here because I need the mats
[00:52:34] because look look look so I I farmed I
[00:52:37] pre-farmed uh the 90 weapon I performed
[00:52:39] it but I need to kill alien lives and
[00:52:42] mechanical
[00:52:44] so we have to do that too on top of the
[00:52:46] normal stuff we have to do
[00:52:48] why is hudao not good for Melbourne
[00:52:49] vaporize
[00:52:51] um
[00:52:53] because melt sucks
[00:53:01] this is a few reasons
[00:53:05] one because Hydro supports are way
[00:53:07] better and apply more Hydro but two
[00:53:09] that's not even the real reason because
[00:53:10] even if Central was cryo
[00:53:12] um it would be worse than Synchro Hydro
[00:53:14] I'm pretty sure because you are forward
[00:53:16] uh melting instead of reverse vaporizing
[00:53:19] what that means is you can usually
[00:53:20] vaporize twice
[00:53:22] uh without removing the Hydra like once
[00:53:24] without removing the hydrogen if you
[00:53:25] press again free try drop whereas if it
[00:53:27] was melt because your strong side
[00:53:29] reaction procking
[00:53:31] uh you would in one pyro onto cryo it
[00:53:34] would remove the cryo whereas one power
[00:53:36] onto Hydro usually I know there's like
[00:53:39] like use whatever that's called like
[00:53:41] auras that are stronger no what is it
[00:53:43] called what the [ __ ] is it you a unit of
[00:53:45] application whatever you know what I
[00:53:46] mean
[00:53:47] tldr you need twice as much cryo as
[00:53:49] Hydro in order to melt so it usually
[00:53:51] it's worse
[00:53:55] gauge I guess it is just gauge gauge
[00:53:58] unit
[00:54:07] I just know they're called to use I
[00:54:09] forgot what used that I mean I know U
[00:54:10] stands for unit but I've never had to
[00:54:12] use unit in a sentence before
[00:54:20] hit me one more time I'm gonna call
[00:54:22] Silver Wolf and she's gonna she's gonna
[00:54:24] she's gonna type words that I would get
[00:54:26] banned if I typed
[00:54:28] silver rose got my back I know silver
[00:54:30] wolf got me if no one got me silver wolf
[00:54:31] got me
[00:54:36] justices
[00:54:38] now disappear she'll tell you to reroll
[00:54:41] she'll tell you to re-roll yourself in
[00:54:43] game silver roll food I wouldn't I'm a
[00:54:46] nice person I wouldn't say that silver
[00:54:47] wolf would
[00:54:50] foreign
[00:54:53] this is double speed
[00:54:56] wait what was that [ __ ]
[00:54:59] I'm sure they got that already
[00:55:09] see one or weapon I have about a minute
[00:55:12] of me talking about that in my novelette
[00:55:13] guide examination Mark new vid uh and I
[00:55:16] included a cool infographic on screen
[00:55:17] tldr they're both good
[00:55:21] um C1 if your skill issue and you need
[00:55:23] resistance interruption or uh if you
[00:55:26] already have a good weapon like stock
[00:55:28] Jade if not his signature weapon is
[00:55:30] pretty foggy
[00:55:33] watch your video I did that
[00:55:36] the dinosaur
[00:55:40] did
[00:55:42] what do you mean C1 is more damage well
[00:55:47] are you sure
[00:55:52] Because unless your math tells you
[00:55:54] otherwise it would seem that Eternal
[00:55:56] flow is anywhere from a 30 to 50 average
[00:55:58] from Amber it varies there's different
[00:56:00] calcs different teams different ER Recs
[00:56:02] this also assumes your sub stats the
[00:56:05] where you would need ER are being
[00:56:06] reinvested into either HP or crit
[00:56:08] offensively
[00:56:09] but uh it's a pretty [ __ ] huge
[00:56:11] difference now it's not compared to like
[00:56:13] Jade R5 definitely not getting that then
[00:56:15] go for C1 instead or if you need a
[00:56:16] resistance interruption or if you uh
[00:56:21] I mean there's a few like it could be
[00:56:23] expensive to pull on a weapon Banner
[00:56:24] like there's a few things but
[00:56:26] yeah
[00:56:28] his signature is really good
[00:56:37] is lost prayer worth we're moving faster
[00:56:40] while lasering listen Lost Bear is
[00:56:42] pretty good but it's not because you can
[00:56:44] move faster that is not why you're
[00:56:46] picking that weapon
[00:56:48] I forgot it [ __ ] did that
[00:56:59] okay as a unit
[00:57:02] I'm a big fan of Navidad right now but
[00:57:04] if you're asking which C1 is a better
[00:57:05] upgrade Hotel
[00:57:07] but I don't know if you're asking which
[00:57:08] one's a better character because that I
[00:57:09] would not like to comment on for illegal
[00:57:11] reasons because I love Hotel Mains and I
[00:57:13] love Navidad means
[00:57:16] why is your nav doing no damage I have
[00:57:18] no setup in my team I'm just
[00:57:22] I will punt you
[00:57:24] if you ask a question like that again
[00:57:26] watch your tone with me young man
[00:57:34] it's okay if you ignore this but if you
[00:57:36] have time could you judge my future she
[00:57:38] out build that's on canvas 600 and this
[00:57:41] is a thousand bits pandas what okay for
[00:57:44] a thousand bits sure I won't don't allow
[00:57:46] you but
[00:57:47] can you judge my future child build
[00:57:49] that's on Candace
[00:57:53] okay why is it on Candace
[00:58:00] chicken nuggets
[00:58:02] I'm gonna
[00:58:05] Candace
[00:58:07] staff at home a level
[00:58:10] look I'm gonna cut you some slack
[00:58:11] because there's a home abandon right now
[00:58:13] but at least level your pull arm
[00:58:17] okay your other weapons are leveled so
[00:58:18] I'm gonna assume that this was just you
[00:58:20] just pulled it fine I accept that okay
[00:58:22] artifacts should say hunter
[00:58:29] why am I looking at your talents
[00:58:33] those are your artifacts another show
[00:58:35] this is pretty good keep in mind though
[00:58:38] that you can always strong box for a
[00:58:39] million so if your manage this is really
[00:58:41] good keep that don't Farm anything else
[00:58:43] but if I look at these pieces and
[00:58:44] they're bad why are you not at the
[00:58:46] strong box let's look
[00:58:48] I am mad at you right now but it's out
[00:58:50] of jealousy so I will say nice peace
[00:58:52] because I am
[00:58:55] above jealous remarks feather
[00:58:59] that's pretty tasty says not bad goblet
[00:59:06] I slammed my desk and it closed the
[00:59:08] screen
[00:59:11] I am mad right now someone asked why are
[00:59:14] you misguiding new players what do you
[00:59:15] mean Vermilion are about as good
[00:59:17] maestros is more efficient to farm as a
[00:59:18] domain because there's golden troop and
[00:59:20] managed to say so you should Farm it
[00:59:21] anyways but if you're just looking for a
[00:59:23] shower set then you might as well
[00:59:24] strongbox Vermillion because you can
[00:59:25] just strongbox it you don't have to go
[00:59:26] do uh echo's domain that is the correct
[00:59:29] answer if you disagree you're wrong
[00:59:32] but uh this domain's really efficient so
[00:59:35] you might as well
[00:59:38] okay this is good let's look at the
[00:59:40] circlet now now keep in mind the circuit
[00:59:42] has to be crit damage it can't really be
[00:59:44] criterated because you get a lot of
[00:59:45] crude right here and child is an
[00:59:46] Ascension criterate so if it's
[00:59:49] thank you
[00:59:51] how this this domain just came out this
[00:59:53] domain just ice
[00:59:58] Hillary
[01:00:00] silly turtle
[01:00:07] I spent 80 fragile resin on this new
[01:00:10] domain
[01:00:12] and I don't have anything like this
[01:00:38] now normally I would roll a dice one to
[01:00:41] six and if it hit six and you Flex I
[01:00:43] would ban you but because it's ciao I
[01:00:44] let Chow people Flex because this is a
[01:00:46] Xiao say space with that in mind you
[01:00:48] have this which I don't even have Inver
[01:00:49] million
[01:00:52] please please I will love you forever
[01:00:55] Elon I already love you forever but roll
[01:00:57] a six here
[01:01:00] and I'll call you better than Synchro
[01:01:02] [ __ ] it misinformation
[01:01:08] six give me a six
[01:01:21] okay well
[01:01:28] I'm happy for you though I I can't wait
[01:01:31] for you to get ciao no but a pretty good
[01:01:33] build pretty good build you have enough
[01:01:34] crit rate because Mario safe
[01:01:36] uh and you have a bunch of crit damages
[01:01:38] from Attack percent I didn't see your ER
[01:01:40] I'm gonna assume you have energy
[01:01:41] recharge if you don't
[01:01:45] I will
[01:01:47] silence shall will find you
[01:01:50] if you don't have enough energy recharge
[01:01:52] Xiao will show up in your room at 3am so
[01:01:56] make sure your shout has enough ER you
[01:01:58] don't want him showing up at your in
[01:02:00] your room at 6 00 am

[01:02:47] I don't need ER
[01:02:49] dude you don't need a yard with lesions
[01:02:51] I mean you do need
[01:02:53] Le it depends on your team but like
[01:02:55] shut up I don't what is that pet it's
[01:02:57] the new one the anniversary one you open
[01:02:59] your mail and you get it he's eating
[01:03:07] where is he in the Spectrum what does
[01:03:10] that have to do with anything what is it
[01:03:12] what would that have to do with anything
[01:03:16] I'm not a [ __ ] I'm not a [ __ ]
[01:03:18] psychologist I don't know
[01:03:29] he's good though he's really good like
[01:03:31] the only reason I am not kidding
[01:03:34] literally no yolk right now the only
[01:03:37] reason my thumbnail doesn't say broken
[01:03:38] is because there's broken here and
[01:03:39] broken there so I didn't I was like I'm
[01:03:41] not gonna use broken three times that
[01:03:42] looks weird he'll be like oh you call
[01:03:43] everything shut up [ __ ] you I don't he's
[01:03:45] actually really good
[01:04:00] is the one who's broken yeah I mean the
[01:04:02] other one is Fishel who is like a top
[01:04:05] [ __ ]
[01:04:06] five unit how high would I rank official
[01:04:08] I don't know but she's top top something
[01:04:10] she's really [ __ ] good so honestly
[01:04:12] especially with golden troop now she
[01:04:13] might be she's very [ __ ] high
[01:04:16] what do I have to do oh I have to kill
[01:04:18] these things
[01:04:19] did I get it I did
[01:04:27] oh where's the other one
[01:04:30] what's over there
[01:04:44] why is every 1.04 so still the best
[01:04:46] characters in genjin dude because
[01:04:48] they're afraid they're afraid they know
[01:04:50] what Bennett did and what Fishel did and
[01:04:53] what singcho and sucrose did so they
[01:04:55] were and Chang Ling so they're afraid
[01:04:58] We're not gonna get another Chang Ling
[01:05:00] We're not gonna get another [ __ ]
[01:05:01] Bennett
[01:05:03] is Lenny not as
[01:05:05] dude one patch went by and people are
[01:05:08] asking if Lenny's bad now what could
[01:05:10] have happened that made Lenny bad
[01:05:11] Lenny's good
[01:05:12] that is good
[01:05:34] linovulet
[01:05:37] I mean I like navinet but I'm not I mean
[01:05:41] okay linea's teams are also Bennett
[01:05:44] kazua Zhang LI or Bennett kazua
[01:05:48] shangling so it's like
[01:05:50] Lenny's scenes are really [ __ ] good
[01:05:51] but Nevada also has really really strong
[01:05:53] teams because you can run um
[01:05:55] you could also run Kazo with him and
[01:05:57] then like Fishel
[01:06:02] so both of the
[01:06:03] other chart very high DPS wise like
[01:06:05] they're probably both really good
[01:06:09] uh in my biased opinion
[01:06:13] I mean both of them have good AOE
[01:06:16] yeah I like both
[01:06:18] but I wonder for your account depends on
[01:06:20] the characters you have true
[01:06:24] true
[01:06:25] I mean I've said this before and I think
[01:06:27] it's also true with navilette Hydro 5
[01:06:31] stars are all like basically all of them
[01:06:34] with like maybe an exception but just in
[01:06:36] general they're all very valuable and
[01:06:39] they all have like certain teams where
[01:06:40] they shine but each of them goes down in
[01:06:43] strength based on how many other Hydro 5
[01:06:45] Stars you have there's like some
[01:06:46] exceptions like like Yvonne's probably
[01:06:49] always good but like just in general
[01:06:50] Hydro 5 stars are like
[01:06:52] the more you have the less you want
[01:06:54] another one because like yeah
[01:06:57] you can use them for almost everything
[01:07:14] okay
[01:07:16] I hate these [ __ ] chest looking
[01:07:19] things they bait me every time
[01:07:21] every time and I know they're not chest
[01:07:24] but I still have to check
[01:07:27] where's my [ __ ] commission oh I have
[01:07:29] to make like a cafe coffee right
[01:07:31] hold up
[01:07:36] which element do you think hoyo is the
[01:07:38] hardest time balancing wait what do you
[01:07:39] mean
[01:07:46] uh I mean Geo's not an element
[01:07:51] pyro because shangly exists that's
[01:07:54] actually not even about it that's not
[01:07:55] even a bad take
[01:07:58] uh I'll go with the Rainbow Road
[01:08:16] Elon or nevi in hyperbloom well do you
[01:08:19] want an outfielder or an on Fielder
[01:08:25] they are very different since I started
[01:08:27] watching you I have 36 uh if you are
[01:08:30] planning on playing hyperbloom though it
[01:08:32] could be a good idea to play navilette
[01:08:33] there and then your second team could be
[01:08:35] along pretty easily because it's very
[01:08:37] rare that you're second oh achievement
[01:08:39] it's very rare that your second team
[01:08:40] doesn't want you on maybe maybe you're
[01:08:42] playing like mini
[01:08:43] but
[01:08:45] yilon is more you can track her in any
[01:08:48] team then maybe that so if one of your
[01:08:50] teams really wants a hydro like on
[01:08:52] Fielder you can put them and then the
[01:08:53] other team can use it off
[01:08:57] mihoyo literally refuses to add a good
[01:08:59] crit Claymore to not make the Luke
[01:09:00] stronger
[01:09:03] claim or something like the best weapons
[01:09:05] no one can use them though there's
[01:09:08] [ __ ] serpent spy on a battle pass
[01:09:10] look at this this [ __ ] gives you 10 more
[01:09:13] damage stacking up to five times that's
[01:09:16] R5 though but there's also Red Sea bacon
[01:09:19] there's [ __ ] red horn which yeah low
[01:09:21] base attack but you run Bennett and
[01:09:23] power residence because you're a [ __ ]
[01:09:24] Deluxe pyro anyways and you probably run
[01:09:25] bet it and also wolves
[01:09:33] I guess some of the Claymore suck balls
[01:09:35] but dude even a wave break I mean
[01:09:37] aquamaro's good
[01:09:39] wait why was I gonna say wavebreaker
[01:09:41] Finn I don't know but aquamar is pretty
[01:09:43] good makhaira could be but it's em
[01:09:47] IL flower is okay
[01:09:49] [ __ ] tuna
[01:09:55] okay this weapon's kind of kicked W
[01:09:56] though but
[01:09:57] other five stars claimers kind of suck
[01:10:00] I okay
[01:10:02] yes but it's mostly because Claymore
[01:10:05] characters are what they are
[01:10:06] like Beacon of the Red Sea which is
[01:10:08] Dan's weapon is like just good and
[01:10:11] Serpent's finest [ __ ] stupid broken
[01:10:13] but a lot of the times it's like who's
[01:10:16] gonna use them
[01:10:21] red horns like the effect is Niche but
[01:10:23] the stat line is good it's like an
[01:10:25] aqueous that line but Aqua has a more
[01:10:27] Global Effect but Claymore characters
[01:10:31] maybe it's just a deluke take where it's
[01:10:33] like you could just run Bennett with him
[01:10:34] I guess that's a dilute take but
[01:10:36] wolves I think wolves
[01:10:39] is a really good stat stick it's also
[01:10:41] the effect is like
[01:10:43] okay I think okay I think okay I think
[01:10:46] okay I think the effect used to be bad
[01:10:48] not bad okay it's never been bad but
[01:10:51] like it used to be like
[01:10:52] copium you're fighting a boss you're
[01:10:54] never gonna proc it but I feel like a
[01:10:55] lot of the abysses now
[01:10:57] I feel like a lot of them just have like
[01:10:59] a random ass enemy that you can proc it
[01:11:01] on and then you could just like sing
[01:11:02] troll doesn't snapshots so you'll buff
[01:11:04] him or you just like re-summon author
[01:11:05] some [ __ ]
[01:11:06] I don't know
[01:11:09] I don't know I like wolves
[01:11:18] and then they go back to bosses and it's
[01:11:19] bad again yeah but the attacks that you
[01:11:21] get is still good
[01:11:23] it's original Snapchat yes all the
[01:11:25] snapshots on the summon oh the reason so
[01:11:30] itself but then you get buffed you can
[01:11:31] re-summon us and then restarts
[01:11:36] true
[01:11:45] the signature is Never Gonna rerun oh
[01:11:47] but wait till genjen's anniversary when
[01:11:49] we get the anniversary daya's weapon and
[01:11:52] tanari's weapon are gonna be on the
[01:11:54] standard Banner because they're standard
[01:11:56] characters that aren't gonna get reruns
[01:11:58] so their weapons are being added to the
[01:12:01] standard pool
[01:12:03] for the anniversary yep
[01:12:05] just wait till the live stream
[01:12:07] why are you extra loud today
[01:12:13] uh I don't know
[01:12:16] that's a good question
[01:12:22] there's a new book event weapon good on
[01:12:24] Wanderer if you can make use of the ER
[01:12:26] yes it could be a good free to play
[01:12:28] option but a lot of times
[01:12:30] wander would prefer others stats than ER
[01:12:33] I'm sure there's going to be [ __ ]
[01:12:34] math done by like wandermain so probably
[01:12:36] check that but like
[01:12:38] it's the stats you gain are good but you
[01:12:41] can't really use the I mean you can use
[01:12:43] the ER it's just like usually creating
[01:12:45] stuff's better so it depends on what
[01:12:47] else you have
[01:12:49] like I don't think you would use it over
[01:12:51] like Whitsett or something unless you
[01:12:53] really need the ER which maybe you do at
[01:12:54] C2
[01:12:57] sure
[01:13:00] thoughts on Golden troop Daya
[01:13:03] I need a hockey to full screen my camera
[01:13:06] get out
[01:13:08] I don't have a hockey I'm gonna buy a
[01:13:10] stream deck I
[01:13:12] it's fine it's actually fine it's just
[01:13:14] Deus
[01:13:23] with Sith dies of frames dude which
[01:13:26] which I am the biggest wizard lover I
[01:13:30] got hate well I didn't get hate there's
[01:13:31] like a discussion by one person in a
[01:13:33] Discord server which to most content
[01:13:36] creators would be like wow I'm getting
[01:13:37] hate but it was literally just one
[01:13:38] person but anyways for saying that
[01:13:40] whitsith was like good on yai when she
[01:13:42] came out and be like I can't believe you
[01:13:44] recommend it dude is [ __ ] busting I
[01:13:47] hate people who don't like what's up
[01:13:49] dude just [ __ ] learn to rotate it's
[01:13:52] not that hard I'm kidding sometimes it's
[01:13:54] just inconsistent okay sometimes it
[01:13:55] doesn't line up I get it but front
[01:13:57] loaded damage is a lot better than
[01:13:58] backloader damage it's nice also worst
[01:14:01] case you reset and then you can if
[01:14:02] you're relying on the reset you can
[01:14:04] clear content where you otherwise
[01:14:05] wouldn't be able to clear also for a lot
[01:14:07] of characters all three effects are good
[01:14:08] all and some other characters you only
[01:14:10] want one or two also the average usually
[01:14:12] averages out to being average average
[01:14:15] lover
[01:14:22] golden trip out they don't work yes it
[01:14:23] can be as best thought if you have a lot
[01:14:24] of
[01:14:26] [ __ ] baby dude where I dropped my mouse
[01:14:28] where did my bubbles go let the mighty
[01:14:31] be humble
[01:14:37] foreign
[01:14:42] if you have a lot of defense like
[01:14:44] cinebar spindle and Goro if you don't
[01:14:46] then Huss can be best thought they're
[01:14:47] about as good
[01:14:48] but Golden's a bit better uh it could be
[01:14:50] a bit better
[01:14:56] who uses with question mark Eula main
[01:14:58] question mark dude why are you flaming
[01:15:01] witches like it's not actually dude dude
[01:15:04] dude imagine a character that can use
[01:15:08] all of these Buffs how broken it is if
[01:15:10] you can't and you can only use two like
[01:15:12] a lot can't use em it's still good and
[01:15:14] if you can use only one it's bad however
[01:15:16] do you know what's [ __ ] do you know
[01:15:18] what's stupid do you know what's [ __ ]
[01:15:19] do you know what's [ __ ]
[01:15:20] incomprehensible do you know what
[01:15:22] estupido
[01:15:25] even on a character where woodsith is
[01:15:27] terrible and I don't recommend it it
[01:15:29] still averages out to being about as
[01:15:31] good as the freedom of the option and do
[01:15:33] you know what's [ __ ] on the Viet she
[01:15:34] doesn't want the attack he doesn't want
[01:15:36] the yam that's how good the other one is
[01:15:42] it's still worse like use Amber over it
[01:15:44] but you get my phone yo hey YouTube

[01:18:42] real talk because this is important this

[01:18:47] CIA wants to know your location
[01:18:49] allegedly in game listen
[01:18:51] so I went here I had a seal friend his
[01:18:53] name her name their name was bubble
[01:18:56] Berry puff and they were there and I fed
[01:18:58] them fish and then they left and then I
[01:19:00] found them in the uh uh I found them in
[01:19:03] the uh
[01:19:04] and I think and I went here and I saw
[01:19:07] them again and very puff was with a
[01:19:09] friend and their name was Barry puffer
[01:19:11] and then after I talked to them here
[01:19:13] Barry puffer disappeared and I don't
[01:19:15] know where they are but I'm sure they're
[01:19:16] somewhere does anyone know where they go
[01:19:18] because this is serious and I haven't
[01:19:19] found them does very buff go anywhere
[01:19:21] else after this where the [ __ ] is are
[01:19:23] they dead I need my berry Puff
[01:19:34] foreign
[01:19:40] used to be here like dancing with the uh
[01:19:43] their friends

[01:20:31] [Music]
[01:20:33] thank you for complete
[01:20:38] foreign
[01:20:41] [Music]
[01:21:00] okay let's go on camera resin I forgot I
[01:21:03] was capped
[01:21:05] all right let's go kill the boss we need
[01:21:06] to 90 never let
[01:21:09] yet
[01:21:11] I don't like pronouncing the L's I know
[01:21:13] you're supposed to because it's like
[01:21:14] nouvelle and Ville is like Orville is
[01:21:18] like it's pronounced the L but usually
[01:21:20] when it's V like you don't pronounce the
[01:21:23] [ __ ] else but I think you're supposed
[01:21:25] to because his name is veal but yet
[01:21:27] sounds better than the villette so I
[01:21:29] don't know I don't like pronouncing
[01:21:31] those but I feel like you probably
[01:21:32] should I don't realize
[01:21:39] where did my balls go
[01:21:42] whatever
[01:21:46] a round of applause and voila
[01:21:52] silence
[01:21:56] be sanctified
[01:22:06] did he literally whips out a hydro caulk
[01:22:08] it's actually did I was it was so hard
[01:22:11] for me not to say hydrocock in my guide
[01:22:13] it's literally a hydrocock that's just
[01:22:14] what it is I have to say it
[01:22:20] what up Rick
[01:22:22] by your head
[01:22:30] it's
[01:22:33] but you didn't like charged gameplay I
[01:22:36] don't like charged shots charge attacks
[01:22:38] fine I like hutau
[01:22:40] I like the Luke you might be like dude
[01:22:41] what the [ __ ] dude Luke's not a charge
[01:22:42] hacker really you don't think the Luke's
[01:22:44] a charge tracker okay explain his
[01:22:46] passive that says that charge tax I'm
[01:22:48] gonna cost is increased by 50 and do
[01:22:50] duration is increased by three exactly
[01:22:52] why would he have that if he's not a
[01:22:54] charge hacker that would just be weird
[01:23:04] we were robbed who's we
[01:23:06] name five the Luke mains
[01:23:18] knows me
[01:23:25] as one with wind and Cloud
[01:23:29] your head I used to be a Duluth man
[01:23:32] and then shangling stole my life I used
[01:23:34] to I was so happy I pulled through Luke
[01:23:36] I literally I pulled I got Chang Ling
[01:23:39] like day two day one of the game I got
[01:23:41] shangling then like I was like dude I
[01:23:43] really hope I get to Luke I think
[01:23:44] literally like it's either day one or
[01:23:46] day two I got China I remember I was in
[01:23:47] like I was just like fighting hilly
[01:23:48] trolls and then I I pulled and I got

[01:24:38] to Luke or you won't clear the abyss
[01:24:41] I believe I will and ever since then
[01:24:43] I've been playing my duties
[01:24:51] I couldn't think I blanked I couldn't
[01:24:52] think of a shangling voice line what was
[01:24:54] she saying what did she say nice let's
[01:24:57] see what else eat this that's what she
[01:24:59] said

[01:26:00] I go to a bedroom I realize what's
[01:26:02] happening Chili Peppers everywhere room
[01:26:04] in shambles I turn around shangling
[01:26:07] again
[01:26:08] she screams the final words I hear
[01:26:11] Theory Crafters ruined my life
[01:26:15] that's what I was trying to say I just
[01:26:16] forgot half of it
[01:26:19] [Music]
[01:26:28] can I play an actual team so don't make
[01:26:30] the character look like dog [ __ ]
[01:26:47] haha
[01:26:50] Simon silence
[01:26:54] why'd I do that actually that was bad
[01:26:57] should I call it first can you explain
[01:27:00] what ICD is so if you play shangling
[01:27:03] there's none
[01:27:09] into the wind
[01:27:18] do you know Daya works with new first of
[01:27:20] all don't call him new second of all I
[01:27:22] mentioned that in my video third of all
[01:27:24] works is being used so generously I can
[01:27:27] deduct it as a as a as a charitable gift
[01:27:29] in my taxes oh critical damage
[01:27:41] she works resistance Interruption and
[01:27:43] conversion once a year but that well
[01:27:44] it's not even like that it's that slow
[01:27:46] it's that it lasts like two seconds
[01:27:48] the way you predicted is kid about
[01:27:49] nebula pulling his [ __ ] out dude I
[01:27:52] literally did about Neville and about Al
[01:27:53] Haytham I can't find the clip about me I
[01:27:56] can't find the clip about me predicting
[01:27:58] the villette but I have the clip of me
[01:28:00] predicting alitham let me pull it up let
[01:28:02] me pull it up let me pull up this is
[01:28:04] literally edited I don't know why I
[01:28:05] didn't upload this I literally have so
[01:28:06] many shorts that are edited that I
[01:28:07] didn't upload but literally look
[01:28:10] just don't like send this clip to anyone
[01:28:12] okay I don't normally cover leaks but I
[01:28:14] was looking at hyphen leaks and I saw
[01:28:16] his alt where he whips out his [ __ ] like
[01:28:18] literally just whips it out he says I'll
[01:28:20] root you and then boom it might have
[01:28:23] been a different website I don't know if
[01:28:24] it's a reliable leak Source or if he's
[01:28:26] on the wrong one but he definitely did
[01:28:28] that so I'm excited for him to come just
[01:28:30] don't like
[01:28:31] but literally nephilad did that he
[01:28:33] actually whips it out though like this
[01:28:35] wasn't for all I thought but that
[01:28:37] actually made my dreams come true he
[01:28:39] actually does it looks look he literally
[01:28:41] look look look look look look look at my
[01:28:43] lines
[01:28:45] hmm
[01:28:47] humbled you get to monetize that's the
[01:28:49] second Channel not the second Channel
[01:28:50] short for sure
[01:29:02] was it official damage low well we
[01:29:04] didn't swirl Electro or zhangly Shield I
[01:29:07] think so
[01:29:08] but
[01:29:09] um
[01:29:15] how was it
[01:29:21] oh okay dude gentian is too [ __ ] okay
[01:29:25] genjin's too easy and there's no test
[01:29:27] dummies so when I wanna showcase a
[01:29:30] rotation I have to do it with level one
[01:29:31] weapons or the enemy just dies I'm not
[01:29:34] kidding I have to record rotations with
[01:29:36] level one weapons so that's why
[01:29:39] this could be good
[01:29:51] susk for who
[01:29:55] for me
[01:29:56] hello
[01:30:03] uh it depends
[01:30:07] be sanctified
[01:30:13] for I'm pretty sure it's
[01:30:16] pretty sure it's no for aggravate and
[01:30:18] yes if not aggravated
[01:30:21] but I might need a fact check on that
[01:30:23] one but I know they're similar
[01:30:33] laughs
[01:30:38] explain the death exposing you dude I
[01:30:40] told him I want to do as a Jeff account
[01:30:41] review soon which I will I'll do a video
[01:30:43] where I review his account I think would
[01:30:45] be a good video but I just told him that
[01:30:46] like a few weeks ago and I haven't done
[01:30:48] it yet and I opened account review forms
[01:30:50] and my Discord so he's like why did you
[01:30:51] do that well listen I've been saying did
[01:30:53] I just die I've been saying that I was
[01:30:55] gonna do that for like months I just
[01:30:56] forgot about it so it's like the order
[01:30:57] is I have to do cursing out reviews and
[01:30:59] then I'll do this that was the plan
[01:31:01] foreign
[01:31:43] thank you
[01:31:53] okay I couldn't do the account reviews
[01:31:55] because when I was traveling then two I
[01:31:57] got covered and I was sick now I can do
[01:31:58] it now there's no excuse so I'm gonna go
[01:32:00] through the accounts probably next
[01:32:01] stream we select one and then the stream
[01:32:03] after we do it maybe or I select it off
[01:32:05] stream and then answer me to it one of
[01:32:07] the two but we're gonna do it this week
[01:32:08] uh and we'll do Chris I'll send that a
[01:32:10] little bit of edited boom We upload it
[01:32:12] then I'll probably do Zach account
[01:32:13] review and then a whale account review
[01:32:14] foreign
[01:32:15] and then uid reviews from random
[01:32:17] Chatters and then that's the order of
[01:32:18] account reviews I think
[01:32:28] but there's a UI review video being
[01:32:30] edited right now it's just it's like
[01:32:31] taking a while all good though
[01:32:37] okay charge out good for ganji
[01:32:39] um if you're freezing yes if you're
[01:32:41] melting
[01:32:56] this could be good this is also could be
[01:32:57] good
[01:33:01] there's never That official sucrose
[01:33:02] better a decent team yay brother there's
[01:33:06] an endless world too now if you like
[01:33:09] official beta is a good team just a
[01:33:10] baseline a Nemo character in there can
[01:33:12] help because you can swirl uh sucrose
[01:33:15] the EM is like kind of whatever because
[01:33:17] you're only Electro charging but like I
[01:33:18] mean I guess it adds up but yeah you can
[01:33:20] use it kazua is better and venti would
[01:33:22] might actually be better but you can use
[01:33:24] um
[01:33:25] you can put sucrose on a support weapon
[01:33:27] that helps there hokushin Rings kind of
[01:33:29] asks if you're not on field but
[01:33:34] yeah can still work
[01:33:38] you could also strongly if you have him
[01:33:40] or you could
[01:33:46] well there's a few things I mean I was
[01:33:48] gonna think if you could play a dendro
[01:33:49] character there but it kind of be
[01:33:50] griefing
[01:33:55] drawing tails to Beto yeah you could do
[01:33:57] that too
[01:33:59] I mean the Verdes inventor is huge so
[01:34:07] you have increases taser damage
[01:34:08] significantly I mean he kind of like yes
[01:34:11] but usually sucrose's damage Buffs come
[01:34:13] from yeah there's like birds inventor in
[01:34:15] her passive but also when she's on field
[01:34:16] she swirls a [ __ ] ton more so it's like
[01:34:18] you're making sure you swirl both and a
[01:34:20] cushion ring has good up time and you uh
[01:34:23] are like well yeah you're the driver I
[01:34:26] just don't like her as much as the
[01:34:28] off-field last slot in that team but
[01:34:30] it's not about it's like it's not a bad
[01:34:32] choice it's fine
[01:34:35] you can explain why I read it thinks
[01:34:36] sucrose is trash because of usage raid
[01:34:38] I'm gonna assume that's not a real thing
[01:34:40] and we're not gonna talk about it we're
[01:34:41] gonna pretend that that was probably
[01:34:42] just one person that you saw and not the
[01:34:44] entirety of the website so we're gonna
[01:34:45] pretend that you didn't say that and
[01:34:46] we're not gonna talk about that
[01:34:48] [ __ ]
[01:34:51] wow I love usage rate
[01:34:58] do you guys remember when the national
[01:35:00] team quote-unquote national team had
[01:35:02] Chong Yoon instead of sucrose I remember
[01:35:08] minus one controversy easy clap
[01:35:19] wait is usage rate the thing people look
[01:35:22] at usage rate genshin Abyss wait this is
[01:35:25] the freest video for me I could just be
[01:35:27] like underrated characters and then I
[01:35:28] just pull this [ __ ] up
[01:35:31] all right I'm gonna write that down
[01:35:32] that's a free [ __ ] that's some free
[01:35:34] views right there
[01:35:38] used to trade doesn't [ __ ] matter
[01:35:39] though but
[01:35:41] easy content I guess wait where is it
[01:35:44] what patch is it four point whoa well
[01:35:46] four one's new though
[01:35:57] it was a 4.0 one there's no 4.1 because
[01:36:00] it's new
[01:36:02] foreign
[01:36:07] this has a 1.4 K of boats all right
[01:36:11] let's check it
[01:36:19] how do I [ __ ] full screen this
[01:36:23] bro [ __ ] open the image
[01:36:29] Bennett Elon nahida kazua singhtro could
[01:36:33] call me right
[01:36:35] pride of Fontaine wait be sure to
[01:36:38] befriend them okay but this is them no
[01:36:40] harm okay but this is wait wait just so
[01:36:42] I understand how usage rates works I'm
[01:36:44] pretty sure I looked into this a while
[01:36:45] ago usage rates factors in the
[01:36:48] percentage of people who have the
[01:36:49] character and use it right because like
[01:36:51] everyone like official is like at least
[01:36:53] 74 times better than like half the
[01:36:55] characters here but like if you pull for
[01:36:56] baiju you're probably gonna use him
[01:36:57] whereas everyone has official so like I
[01:37:00] don't know how Sarah is about official
[01:37:01] though that's kind of [ __ ] that is
[01:37:03] like that but like yeah it's also like
[01:37:06] if I pull for a five star I wanna use
[01:37:08] them usually
[01:37:11] so it makes sense kind of
[01:37:18] water comes in many flavors to the
[01:37:21] Discerning palette limited characters
[01:37:22] are inflated yeah he's crisp and pure I
[01:37:25] mean official is five percent I don't
[01:37:28] think I wonder okay stop me when there's
[01:37:30] a better character than official venti
[01:37:32] Sarah gonyu tanari Sino Olivia
[01:37:38] sumeru has a complex flavor you have to
[01:37:42] Sino yo Mia farazan Mona wander ayaka
[01:37:45] yai Miko ayato nilu shenha hutau baiju
[01:37:50] child Lenny cookie I'll hide them
[01:37:53] shangling
[01:37:57] Maybe shangling Cookie but like no like
[01:38:00] no there's just no way not cookie
[01:38:01] because only in a hyperbloom and then
[01:38:03] shangling maybe shinling maybe but shiny
[01:38:06] is not as like
[01:38:07] I I actually wouldn't even say that
[01:38:09] Zhang Lee right in kokomi Starbucks
[01:38:15] 10 times better than visual
[01:38:18] uh visually
[01:38:20] sure personality Maybe
[01:38:23] height absolutely
[01:38:27] damage wise
[01:38:31] maybe if you need an on-fielder you're
[01:38:32] like [ __ ] I have no one to play on field
[01:38:34] Maybe
[01:38:41] but like again these numbers are like
[01:38:42] they don't really mean anything because
[01:38:43] it's like if you pull for a five star
[01:38:45] you're probably gonna use them except
[01:38:47] clean mains
[01:38:50] Ito means when they don't release a Geo
[01:38:51] character for five years
[01:38:53] but yeah it's like visuals like visual
[01:38:55] is like way better than most of the
[01:38:56] characters here but it's like everyone
[01:38:57] has her so it makes sense well it
[01:38:59] doesn't make sense but I kind of get it
[01:39:02] why is Beto solo I actually never
[01:39:05] understood this I've made like five
[01:39:06] videos calling Beto underrated or good
[01:39:09] and she's still no one uses her dude
[01:39:12] I'm actually mad I finally got staff
[01:39:14] with Homer while watching your stream
[01:39:16] thank you for the luck
[01:39:20] sucrose point nine super
[01:39:27] makes sense I mean I guess it makes
[01:39:29] sense now why like
[01:39:32] like I guess it makes sense like okay
[01:39:33] let's say you grow up on like this right
[01:39:35] this is like your only source of
[01:39:37] information and then you see someone
[01:39:38] like me or the Jeff being like yeah like
[01:39:40] sucrose and cause are like pretty
[01:39:42] similar like obviously I like Kazo for
[01:39:44] many reasons he's like convenient you
[01:39:45] can group a lot whatever and like I'll
[01:39:47] say something like sucrose has teams
[01:39:48] where she's just better and you'll be
[01:39:50] like infuriated
[01:39:52] Kaya is 0.3 I mean I guess everyone has
[01:39:54] Kaya but still
[01:39:56] um
[01:39:57] tragedy
[01:40:15] yeah this is uh interesting Kai
[01:40:17] shouldn't be here well I mean it doesn't
[01:40:19] matter it's usually it doesn't [ __ ]
[01:40:20] matter but in an ideal world kaia's not
[01:40:22] here even Lynette is like not bad well I
[01:40:25] mean she's uh yeah yeah Coley's not that
[01:40:28] bad sucrose shouldn't be here Rosario
[01:40:30] shouldn't be there
[01:40:34] like I think yayo's busted so I don't
[01:40:37] know why she's there Beto shouldn't be
[01:40:38] there kitchen probably shouldn't be
[01:40:40] there but she's a standard character so
[01:40:41] it makes sense Barbara is not bad but it
[01:40:43] makes sense that no one uses her
[01:40:46] and then the rest is just
[01:40:48] the rest I guess
[01:41:00] well that was that
[01:41:03] foreign
[01:41:11] through comments
[01:41:13] but I don't want to share my screen
[01:41:15] while I do this
[01:41:16] okay I can share my screen but I'm not
[01:41:18] gonna comment on it I'm not allowed to
[01:41:19] say anything
[01:41:21] I mean most of these are fine but I
[01:41:22] won't say a word
[01:41:49] okay
[01:41:53] dude how did nobody's official
[01:42:02] sorry
[01:42:06] my goal as a streamer is to make Fishel
[01:42:08] go up one percent it's like favorite
[01:42:10] profile
[01:42:11] but she's overrated LOL okay name me a
[01:42:13] better electric character go you can't
[01:42:15] you literally can't
[01:42:17] yeah nice try nice try buddy have fun go
[01:42:20] back to your cave
[01:42:24] Ryden question mark
[01:42:27] s nice try buddy
[01:42:46] but also okay okay also minus six you're
[01:42:49] just having official no I'm not dude she
[01:42:52] does so much I I okay this is gonna be
[01:42:54] my most elitist take that might get
[01:42:56] people mad at me but I feel like if you
[01:42:58] think visual's overrated you just either
[01:43:00] haven't seen the damage numbers or are
[01:43:02] just
[01:43:03] okay if you're a casual you don't care
[01:43:04] that's fine but if you actually carry
[01:43:06] anything visuals bad you're just dumb
[01:43:07] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[01:43:08] no flame no flame no toxicity but
[01:43:11] objectively dude she's so good you don't
[01:43:15] even dude it's like
[01:43:17] okay I'm gonna show you something
[01:43:22] where's the Rune guard that's in uh
[01:43:24] there's one around here I always it's
[01:43:26] hard for me to find every time I don't
[01:43:27] know why I always teleport to it but
[01:43:28] always takes me like oh there it is
[01:43:31] foreign
[01:43:36] usage second of all half the people
[01:43:38] think that either Ryden or yai or kuki's
[01:43:41] better and then the other people rate
[01:43:42] her correctly because she is broken she
[01:43:45] was broken before even dendro came out
[01:43:47] when people thought Elektra was bad she
[01:43:48] was still good because one she's such a
[01:43:50] good battery that she can use either
[01:43:51] with electric carries that are good or
[01:43:53] without a lush she's one of the best
[01:43:54] batteries for non-electro characters
[01:43:56] think about that that doesn't even make
[01:43:58] sense and her Electro app is like second
[01:44:00] to like insane from all field her damage
[01:44:02] is insane her single Target is insane
[01:44:03] her C6 is insane her A4 is insane now
[01:44:06] outside of that she was broken before
[01:44:07] deadro then dendro made her even more
[01:44:09] broken and then golden troop gave her 20
[01:44:11] like 10 to 20 more damage it doesn't
[01:44:13] even make sense like it doesn't make
[01:44:16] sense how at each point you could say
[01:44:17] she's broken but then she just got
[01:44:19] better so it's like impossible to
[01:44:21] overrate her unless you think she's
[01:44:22] better than Synchro that's like the only
[01:44:24] GG

[01:46:51] point yeah even if it was out of range
[01:46:54] that's like outside of his damage
[01:46:57] C6 Pepe w

[01:47:32] actually not bad
[01:47:41] someone typed feels cry dude feels
[01:47:44] graphic is such a good emote
[01:47:45] when Chad just types things that they
[01:47:47] feel like look I feel things too
[01:47:53] so increase of damage visual is better
[01:47:55] than yai question mark scratch
[01:47:58] okay it's not just
[01:48:01] deep breath
[01:48:03] it's not okay
[01:48:05] deep breath

[01:49:01] I already did it's okay people that care
[01:49:03] know other people aren't worth like it's
[01:49:05] fine it's okay you can believe what you
[01:49:07] want to believe it doesn't matter
[01:49:12] however
[01:49:13] this person
[01:49:21] [Laughter]
[01:49:24] okay not so bad
[01:49:27] listen
[01:49:30] listen okay listen it's not first of all
[01:49:34] it's not just about the damage okay
[01:49:36] like first of all damage wise officials
[01:49:39] broken but it's not on top of that best
[01:49:42] battery like not even close
[01:49:45] requires no feel time God buffed many
[01:49:47] times has a new artifact set
[01:49:57] let's say hypothetically yeah I were
[01:50:00] objectively better damage than official
[01:50:01] hypothetically which is not the world we
[01:50:03] live in but let's say that's true right
[01:50:07] doesn't need 17 years of field time to
[01:50:10] right here right now emerge burst right
[01:50:13] here right now emerge also more energy
[01:50:16] also
[01:50:17] good on time
[01:50:21] however
[01:50:27] time to go if you need on-field
[01:50:29] character I think guys really good
[01:50:30] because sometimes you need an on-fielder
[01:50:33] so there's no I don't know why it's like
[01:50:35] an argument just [ __ ] use both it
[01:50:37] doesn't actually matter
[01:50:46] thank you
[01:50:50] guys way more damage okay listen
[01:50:53] if you have time in your rotation to E3
[01:50:55] times burst E3 times and ideally weave
[01:50:58] in a normal attack or two
[01:51:00] and want that in your team then sure but
[01:51:04] Oz is dude
[01:51:06] okay here's how you play official
[01:51:08] that's it you can hyper carry now like
[01:51:11] and you get Perma energy
[01:51:21] let the mighty be humbled
[01:51:27] they're better for tanari yes
[01:51:30] do you know why she's better for
[01:51:31] somebody because there's a lot of
[01:51:32] downtime you can with silly you can cue
[01:51:35] e Shard attack whatever right use your
[01:51:37] [ __ ] your speed shots whatever
[01:51:39] they're called like your fast
[01:51:40] chargebacks someone's that insta charge
[01:51:42] and then you have down time you're not
[01:51:43] just gonna do like normal charge tax on
[01:51:45] him so you might as well go yeah really
[01:51:46] good there time to go
[01:51:50] I need to wait on my breasts
[01:52:01] also you don't need a battery in that
[01:52:02] team
[01:52:03] use your other yeah actually yeah true
[01:52:11] but you I mean I mean yeah I kind of
[01:52:14] wants to burst she has doesn't she have
[01:52:16] a 90 energy cause burst
[01:52:18] so you could use double Electro there
[01:52:20] yeah
[01:52:22] actually don't you normally double extra
[01:52:23] big G and then the eye official Kazo or
[01:52:26] you could use it wrongly if you need but
[01:52:36] ton
[01:52:38] I [ __ ] up I'm not gonna get hydro
[01:52:40] actually they get hydro okay cool
[01:52:44] doesn't that team use special anyways
[01:52:46] that's not
[01:52:55] that's not visual I look right it's
[01:52:56] visual
[01:52:57] it's always visual
[01:53:00] I have to [ __ ] charger charge back up
[01:53:01] manually dies of cringe
[01:53:10] it is always her Oz revealed thyself
[01:53:12] always
[01:53:20] dude I'm actually like I was like maybe

[01:53:42] dendro the [ __ ]
[01:53:45] this looks like you're griefing why the
[01:53:46] [ __ ] could you do that
[01:53:52] hmm
[01:54:15] Sunset look at their damage distribution
[01:54:17] I don't know if I want to do that

[01:54:23] I thought you guys were saying yay does
[01:54:25] way more damage why is it uh why is it
[01:54:27] 44-44 in this team hmm those are one of
[01:54:31] these characters
[01:54:33] like spend time on field hmm that is
[01:54:36] interesting that is interesting hmm that
[01:54:39] is bizarre
[01:54:41] okay I'll get i'll get
[01:54:45] I'll get
[01:54:53] he hates yai dude I love her I just
[01:54:56] don't like misinformation okay [ __ ] you
[01:54:59] sometimes not you you're a normal
[01:55:01] chatter I'm not mad at you but I don't
[01:55:03] like the people that like act as if a
[01:55:05] character's like better and then gets
[01:55:07] mad at me for saying otherwise go [ __ ]
[01:55:08] yourselves I'm allowed to like a
[01:55:10] character but admit when another
[01:55:12] character is better I love the Luke have
[01:55:14] I ever said he's better than Chang Ling
[01:55:15] maybe in 1.0 silence
[01:55:25] actually good
[01:55:29] but I don't think Sean's better than
[01:55:31] Fishel it's not even close if I had to
[01:55:33] choose well I would always shush out but
[01:55:34] like if you choose one for your account
[01:55:36] you're choosing official you're not
[01:55:37] choosing [ __ ] ciao
[01:55:39] I know my place
[01:55:45] what is your every team have caused a
[01:55:46] lot dude Casa is like
[01:55:48] sometimes in life I'm sad or I feel like
[01:55:51] I'm unlucky or I feel like maybe life
[01:55:53] isn't fair and then I wake up and I
[01:55:54] remember that some people play gentian
[01:55:56] without kazua and then I'm happy that's
[01:55:58] just how I'm sorry like yes you don't
[01:56:01] need him yes you can use sucrose yes you

[01:56:20] choosing to respond to them like I can
[01:56:22] just ignore people but sometimes I need
[01:56:24] to like reiterate that yes I must like a
[01:56:27] four fun streamer but also I can't let
[01:56:29] random misinformation spread because it
[01:56:31] causes people to think a character that
[01:56:33] is free is bad or to pull for a
[01:56:35] character and I don't like that if you
[01:56:37] want to pull over someone pull them but

[02:04:52] 256 A.M
[02:04:54] as you wish mainfroy life
[02:04:59] cool it
[02:05:02] do official showcase dude kaching teams
[02:05:04] are official showcases
[02:05:09] catching
[02:05:22] child look at this
[02:05:24] oh kaching official Kirara sucrose this
[02:05:28] looks cool
[02:05:30] huh
[02:05:31] and official's not even on an R5 string
[02:05:33] list okay that's cool
[02:05:38] 42 kaching
[02:05:40] 49 official
[02:05:42] now look at the rotation oh is the
[02:05:44] rotation bad I don't know maybe it is
[02:05:46] I'm not like I'm not fully trusting this
[02:05:48] website but still
[02:05:57] kuching's on Harbinger wait harbinger's
[02:05:59] not bad though Harbinger if you can um
[02:06:01] if you're shielded and can use it it's
[02:06:02] actually good kaching sucks I'm pretty
[02:06:05] sure I have a weapon ranking don't I
[02:06:08] said as you can see the five yeah look
[02:06:10] at this
[02:06:12] Harvard is really good look
[02:06:14] I'm pretty I was pretty confident that I
[02:06:16] was really good but I didn't want to
[02:06:17] just talk without having the thing here
[02:06:18] but yeah look 113 compared to Iron sting
[02:06:21] it's like comparable to a five star
[02:06:22] better than well those five stars aren't
[02:06:24] like ideal but magazines are beautiful
[02:06:26] pretty good creatures they are the prize
[02:06:28] is this the problem with harbingers
[02:06:29] usually can't use it because you need a

[02:06:40] low yeah but it
[02:06:43] that was factored into the math it just
[02:06:46] gives you so much crit that it doesn't
[02:06:47] matter

[02:18:07] wait let's look let's look let's look at
[02:18:09] that let's review it let's review it
[02:18:10] let's review the real one 30k HP
[02:18:12] uh what weapon
[02:18:15] wait that's actually not bad things
[02:18:16] that's fine it's just weird I this is a
[02:18:18] weird weapon but it's not bad it's not
[02:18:20] bad
[02:18:24] it's kind of arm but you get damaged
[02:18:27] right so damage ER you know
[02:18:30] artifacts for emblem
[02:18:33] not bad
[02:18:38] okay there's a lot of good stats here

[02:18:43] lot but there's not a lot
[02:18:45] that's really good
[02:18:47] that's pretty good
[02:18:49] ah I mean for an offset piece I mean er
[02:18:52] do you need the ER I'm sure do you have
[02:18:56] 116 crit rate I mean damage
[02:19:01] it's okay it's okay it could be better
[02:19:05] you need a bit more care damage though
[02:19:07] but I don't know
[02:19:08] it's fine yeah this feather okay the
[02:19:11] thing is like sub stats like HP and er
[02:19:13] are really nice right you need ER on
[02:19:15] your lawn especially if you're not
[02:19:16] playing double Hydro you might need a
[02:19:17] lot
[02:19:19] especially like solo Hydra teams you
[02:19:21] need a lot
[02:19:23] if these are the other sub stats you
[02:19:25] have it's kind of copium like you don't
[02:19:26] want to have [ __ ] 116 crew damage but
[02:19:28] I mean it's not bad you have 30k HP you
[02:19:31] have enough VR it's fine it's just like
[02:19:33] because if it was like 60 120 it would
[02:19:35] be like a good start so like this is

[02:25:02] 32k HP Tome of a trouble flow R1 four
[02:25:05] piece matter shows the hunter C1 1088
[02:25:09] okay
[02:25:10] so far so good let's look flower

[02:25:17] not necessarily better than my flower
[02:25:18] but I'll give you all that aside feather
[02:25:21] pretty good got an HP sub stat good
[02:25:24] criticals
[02:25:29] no comment
[02:25:33] it's pretty decent 20 acre value but
[02:25:35] pretty decent
[02:25:38] this is really good 60 HP time percent
[02:25:40] rate however you made me swap servers
[02:25:45] okay this actually does look good
[02:25:54] um but nebulent ratios also always look
[02:25:56] insane because you get 88 crit damage
[02:25:58] here and then crit damage Ascension and
[02:26:01] then you get criterated from Alexis so
[02:26:03] it's actually more impressive if your
[02:26:05] novel that looks bad with all of that
[02:26:07] it's actually impressive it's actually
[02:26:09] impressive if it looks bad but this is a
[02:26:11] pretty good event I'll give it to you uh

[02:30:46] actually carrying us okay we're gonna
[02:30:48] send the weapon yep boom
[02:30:52] is the current weapon matter good I made
[02:30:53] a review on it you can go watch it
[02:30:55] exclamation mark YouTube but tldr uh it
[02:30:58] depends on how many weapons you need
[02:30:59] both of the five stars are good if you
[02:31:02] want another weapon and if you want Homa
[02:31:05] which is just generically generates a
[02:31:07] good weapon
[02:31:09] uh as far as the four stars go
[02:31:12] the saw is kind of dog [ __ ] I'm pretty
[02:31:14] sure the others are good but I kind of
[02:31:16] forget let me open the banner but the
[02:31:17] fat weapons are good and then the new
[02:31:19] sword is HP which is great and then the
[02:31:22] last weapon I can't remember what it is
[02:31:23] oh yeah there's a physical bow yeah I
[02:31:25] mean okay we ignore the [ __ ] we
[02:31:27] ignore the bow but yeah
[02:31:39] I got Saul trying to get the sword dude
[02:31:41] I also have the saw where is it I might
[02:31:44] use it on there
[02:31:55] it's not the best for official
[02:31:58] um it is a physical weapon if you want
[02:32:00] to play physical official uh
[02:32:02] sure but even physical official kind of
[02:32:06] kind of kind of wants us to do damage
[02:32:14] can you review my Noob ultimately
[02:32:17] 654
[02:32:18] 880 970.
[02:32:26] wait chat should we actually go get
[02:32:27] these
[02:32:30] I did it in my world already though so I
[02:32:32] did the youngstown's world
[02:32:40] really because is it a month
[02:32:42] can you repeat that no I can't this is a
[02:32:45] vibe
[02:32:56] I just showed them it I literally just
[02:32:58] showed them I literally just showed them
[02:33:00] I just showed it
[02:33:03] well we have so much crit rate what the
[02:33:05] [ __ ]
[02:33:08] is are we not like
[02:33:10] almost basically a hundred
[02:33:13] so
[02:33:19] all right Milo I will join your world
[02:33:21] [ __ ] we're going to speed on these
[02:33:22] starfish actually a speed run stream
[02:33:32] wait what I'm in the wrong menu
[02:33:40] how is 97 high it's not a hundred true
[02:33:43] but you get eight percent dude there's a
[02:33:45] good chance to get eight percent in the
[02:33:46] abyss so I'm basically a hundred and
[02:33:49] five
[02:33:51] best [ __ ] hyperboom team just Nikita
[02:33:53] Nikita Ryden and then you don't even
[02:33:55] need a last slot so just put whatever
[02:33:56] you want
[02:33:58] is nice there
[02:34:01] or another Electro
[02:34:26] where's Lenny there he is
[02:34:30] that team triggers Max charge attack
[02:34:31] buff uh well with Zhang Lee yes because
[02:34:35] you have dendro Electro
[02:34:37] flag slot so you can however it doesn't
[02:34:39] really matter
[02:34:41] um
[02:34:42] like it's a nice bonus it's a damage
[02:34:44] increase to char Jack a pretty big one
[02:34:46] but in a hybridland team you have a lot
[02:34:48] of source of damage it's not all him so
[02:34:49] like in the grand scheme of things it's
[02:34:51] better to just have a functioning team
[02:34:52] than just focus on that
[02:34:54] but yeah you can still you can you still
[02:34:56] can with C1 you could get it easier
[02:34:59] zero you can but you would need like
[02:35:01] zhangly as your last thought or cause or
[02:35:03] whatever the [ __ ]
[02:35:07] W then you have some virgins
[02:35:12] oh are there no starfish here I thought
[02:35:13] there's more
[02:35:14] here
[02:35:27] how good is never let's see two it's
[02:35:28] just like 46 48 whatever it's just
[02:35:31] freaker damage
[02:35:34] that is exactly how good it is screw
[02:35:36] damage you're welcome boom that's free
[02:35:41] you can stop at C1 but if you want just
[02:35:43] freaker damage and have pretty much Ms
[02:35:45] you can get it I don't think it's needed
[02:35:47] it's not like a fun constellation it's
[02:35:49] literally just crit damage but you know
[02:35:51] is a great DPS at C6 it's not free well
[02:35:56] okay it's a constellation obviously it's
[02:35:57] not free but like you know what I mean

[03:11:28] seven eight swamp
[03:11:33] that sucks
[03:11:34] I mean whatever we still fear I guess
[03:11:43] you're coming with me your coming was
[03:11:46] foretold
[03:11:48] seems like an emergency
[03:11:52] your sins way upon your soul you stay
[03:11:55] conditioned
[03:11:59] your Penance is too
[03:12:03] he's staying content
[03:12:06] oh
[03:12:07] yeah guilty guilty why is this guy not
[03:12:11] grouping
[03:12:15] midnight Finn a bitter pill to swallow
[03:12:18] remember health comes up fun silver
[03:12:23] judgment is upon you
[03:12:27] wait why is someone acting like do it
[03:12:31] needs a Healer and me saying he doesn't
[03:12:33] is bad do you understand that the only
[03:12:35] reason he needs a Healer with cookie is
[03:12:37] because kooky is close range so you have
[03:12:39] to stay close to enemies which makes you
[03:12:41] get hit you understand that right which
[03:12:44] I also mentioned why are you typing that
[03:12:46] like I didn't mention that same with
[03:12:47] Chang Ling is the reason why he plays
[03:12:50] Zhang Lee well it's not like kazo's
[03:12:52] better than drunk right there usually he
[03:12:53] would go wrongly over Cosmo in the
[03:12:55] chiangling team because you have to stay
[03:12:56] close to enemies so if you're not C1
[03:12:57] you're probably gonna get [ __ ] [ __ ]
[03:13:09] also we're playing nilu
[03:13:12] care for it I see everything
[03:13:16] about your head
[03:13:18] ow
[03:13:20] L
[03:13:23] I didn't get to hit that guy though
[03:13:25] unfortunate
[03:13:27] can I kill him before he yes I did yes
[03:13:30] we were here to watch
[03:13:36] did I Mark the other one yes I did cool
[03:13:39] foreign
[03:13:42] Shield is recommended but it makes the
[03:13:44] game too easy
[03:13:45] so we might as well challenge ourselves
[03:13:47] you know
[03:13:48] it's more fun this way
[03:13:49] how is this wrongly
[03:13:52] and play blindfolded
[03:13:58] quietly now take it easy
[03:14:02] remember help
[03:14:05] I just can't see one true but mine is
[03:14:07] 100
[03:14:10] or you could just dodge
[03:14:12] it save a hundred dollars
[03:14:14] silver judgment is upon you it's up to
[03:14:18] you both are viable
[03:14:21] oh I'm gonna miss an eye here the
[03:14:23] [ __ ] cryo resonance or cryo debuff
[03:14:26] that I knew it I knew if you call it
[03:14:29] it's not enough
[03:14:31] how did Lo-Fi start playing
[03:14:35] [ __ ] it we're listening to Lo-Fi
[03:14:42] [ __ ] it
[03:14:45] oh they might Dash the wrong way now
[03:14:47] coogi's gonna die
[03:14:50] Mr
[03:14:59] s
[03:15:14] [Music]
[03:15:20] [Music]
[03:15:24] why are we playing a sign of Team here
[03:15:26] against the cryo shielding enemy seems
[03:15:30] like an emergency probably should have
[03:15:31] funneled particles into your lawn but
[03:15:36] it's okay I guess
[03:15:42] your sins lay upon your soul guilty
[03:15:46] I'm Gonna Save my eye
[03:15:49] your Penance is due
[03:15:53] excuse me
[03:15:56] [Applause]
[03:15:58] dude chill dude chill no to run judgment
[03:16:03] is upon you
[03:16:05] I shall attack firsts can I get another
[03:16:07] Ian before the eye I don't know I don't
[03:16:10] know I got it
[03:16:15] [ __ ] you
[03:16:17] quietly now
[03:16:19] Here Comes The Catch seems like an
[03:16:22] emergency
[03:16:23] no wrestling surrender no rest for the
[03:16:27] wicked I started by accident so
[03:16:33] oh my God
[03:16:37] nice official showcase it is always
[03:16:39] official showcase
[03:16:46] it always is it always has been it
[03:16:49] always will be
[03:16:51] oh a new day
[03:16:55] dude I didn't bench Sino okay my ratio
[03:17:00] is a bit off right now
[03:17:02] uh
[03:17:03] Uh something's not right but I did not
[03:17:06] bench my Sino let that be clear and let
[03:17:09] that be known Sino is not will not and
[03:17:13] has not be or been benched
[03:17:21] it was better
[03:17:23] our ER is a bit low though I kind of
[03:17:25] want more depends on the team I play
[03:17:26] donated one dollar after you get a big T
[03:17:30] from Finish of this I'm not checking
[03:17:34] okay
[03:17:36] if your shower isn't perfect I will
[03:17:39] literally find you
[03:17:42] bake you a cookie throw the cookie on
[03:17:44] the ground in front of you then walk
[03:17:45] away
[03:17:47] I don't even know where it is anymore it
[03:17:48] was like
[03:17:59] wait what is this seven
[03:18:02] two
[03:18:03] five four two
[03:18:07] okay so that's what I'm doing though
[03:18:10] this is two-piece tupi that's fine I
[03:18:13] respect it
[03:18:16] your flower's decent your feather is
[03:18:18] really good [ __ ] you your Sans is
[03:18:20] terrible I mean 12th grade it's fine
[03:18:25] what this is me
[03:18:37] it's okay
[03:18:40] no ER c0
[03:18:42] oh that is true
[03:18:44] they do have the 105.2
[03:18:49] but the golf is good and the
[03:18:52] um other two piece is good
[03:18:58] it's not bad
[03:19:01] checking you lose weapon okay listen
[03:19:04] I have explained this before I will
[03:19:06] explain it again nilu is not a
[03:19:08] materialistic individual she actually
[03:19:12] advocates for using what you have and
[03:19:15] not in defining your self-worth on
[03:19:18] consumerism and what you can buy and
[03:19:20] afford to buy because of this
[03:19:23] is on where the [ __ ] is Neil my nilu is
[03:19:26] on her signature weapon the doll blade
[03:19:28] because with dull blade and level one
[03:19:30] talents she still performs very well
[03:19:32] because all of her weapons are [ __ ]
[03:19:34] garbage unless you have HP which I don't
[03:19:35] have or like key or whatever uh and she
[03:19:39] just needs a good amount of HP which you
[03:19:40] can do on your artifacts so give her
[03:19:41] good artifacts the rest doesn't really
[03:19:42] matter
[03:19:44] I mean I might get the HP sword but like
[03:19:46] we didn't get it and we got the weapon
[03:19:48] so I'm not gonna keep pulling
[03:19:50] it's literally easier to get key than to
[03:19:52] get a specific four star sometimes like
[03:19:55] what like it forces are hard dude
[03:20:06] also double blade is funnier is Fab
[03:20:09] technically better sure but
[03:20:12] double blade
[03:20:15] she comes with it equipped already
[03:20:19] for C6 good luck
[03:20:27] would cookie or writing be better hide
[03:20:29] from the federal dragon's vein I mean
[03:20:31] okay generally I say kooky but for never
[03:20:35] let
[03:20:35] I like ride a lot because it lets you be
[03:20:37] further range and you don't necessarily
[03:20:39] need a Healer on him if you need the
[03:20:40] Healer go cookie if not go either also
[03:20:45] um
[03:20:49] wait isn't there another em pull arm am
[03:20:51] I dumb is there literally no other one
[03:20:57] isn't there one more
[03:21:02] oh katane yeah yeah that one the [ __ ]
[03:21:05] Discord model one true I can't craft it
[03:21:07] because I'm never gonna stop the rain
[03:21:09] but yeah the kitten spear you can
[03:21:10] describe that one
[03:21:16] Subaru craftable too
[03:21:22] dude I'll make a new playlist this song
[03:21:24] okay this place is 154 songs okay and I
[03:21:28] have other ones but listen I will update
[03:21:30] it soon just wait for the next Abyss
[03:21:33] wait is the abyss changing next reset it
[03:21:35] probably is right holy [ __ ] Waits
[03:21:44] okay I should stream that
[03:21:52] okay well we know where we're streaming
[03:21:53] next
[03:22:01] change is tomorrow yeah apparently
[03:22:06] stream tomorrow kick wait I was low-key
[03:22:08] planning on streaming tomorrow but this
[03:22:10] is like technically after tomorrow like
[03:22:11] this would be like an early stream the
[03:22:13] day after tomorrow or really late
[03:22:15] tomorrow I don't know what's better it
[03:22:16] depends on my sleep schedule so we'll
[03:22:17] see I guess
[03:22:20] no no I still play it but I just stream
[03:22:23] it less
[03:22:24] it's harder to stream I feel like
[03:22:29] it's harder for me to like be an active
[03:22:32] streamer while I'm Auto battling even if
[03:22:35] the content's fun versus what I'm like I
[03:22:37] don't know
[03:23:09] we'll probably play 1680 next Abyss
[03:23:12] unironically because we always do a
[03:23:13] four-star clear of every Abyss and the
[03:23:15] 16 is not the best for us our team so
[03:23:18] so I don't even run an ad I don't wanna
[03:23:20] okay I'm sorry 30 seconds
[03:23:24] sorry
[03:23:32] do I have too much great now did I want
[03:23:34] 300 damage though I feel like I'm a
[03:23:36] failure if I can't get 300 damage
[03:23:45] clap clap
[03:23:50] wait this is better
[03:23:53] oh well we did it boom 300.
[03:24:02] yeah I like that there you go 300.
[03:24:10] we lose an ER substance that way though
[03:24:11] but should be fine with
[03:24:14] her and if it isn't we could just get
[03:24:15] maybe a one or two more
[03:24:30] when review I don't know
[03:24:33] soon
[03:24:36] two ads I'm sorry
[03:24:47] that's the obstetrician yeah for the
[03:24:48] most part
[03:24:49] commit to a timer I'll block you dude
[03:24:51] okay it's not that important it's like
[03:24:52] not like a priority video it's just I
[03:24:54] want to do that account review I think
[03:24:55] it's a good idea but I promised my
[03:24:57] computer I do curse account reviews
[03:24:59] first which I've been stalling forever
[03:25:01] so I think I do that and then I do that
[03:25:04] I talked about this earlier the order is
[03:25:05] one curse then you and then will that's
