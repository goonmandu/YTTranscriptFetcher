[00:18:07] okay I'm sorry let's let's let's close
[00:18:10] that I'm sorry that was that one was
[00:18:17] weak oh new second Channel video Ron May
[00:18:22] build and clearing the new memory of
[00:18:23] chaos very POG very POG very POG also a
[00:18:27] a main Channel short came
[00:18:30] out oh meline not happy oh it's like
[00:18:34] okay I'm going to close genin chat the
[00:18:36] only reason I have genin open okay I'm
[00:18:38] going to be honest I'm going to be
[00:18:39] honest with you guys we're going to
[00:18:40] we're going to play genin today but let
[00:18:42] me first be honest with you guys okay
[00:18:43] the main reason I have it open is to
[00:18:45] exploit one of the new exploits They
[00:18:47] just added it's not an exploit actually
[00:18:49] um but it's an event you know how you
[00:18:51] get uh mail for the [ __ ] Web Time
[00:18:53] Event thing whoa you can go do the web
[00:18:55] event there's actually another event
[00:18:56] with it you might know you might not
[00:18:58] know know basically if you have rizzly
[00:19:00] whatever damage your normal attack hits
[00:19:02] as long as it's under 2,000 will be
[00:19:04] converted to resin so if we hit
[00:19:06] 1620 yeah so it's only once it's only
[00:19:09] once you can't do this too many times if
[00:19:11] you have rizzly be sure to do this it
[00:19:13] has to be that exact slime on the foggy
[00:19:15] Forest path uh make sure you're not
[00:19:17] doing over 2,000 damage I did 1620 uh
[00:19:20] which is why I had I got exactly 1620
[00:19:21] resin you might be like oh fake copium
[00:19:23] fake copium but if it was fake if it
[00:19:25] were fake how would I even my screen
[00:19:28] just block how would you even be able to
[00:19:30] fake that like I can't plan 1620 and the
[00:19:33] resin so yeah it's just the thing right
[00:19:35] now be sure to go do it uh let me know
[00:19:36] if it works for you in the comments down
[00:19:50] below chat I saw every streamer and
[00:19:53] their mother true I saw their mothers
[00:19:55] watching the hoyo fair stream and I
[00:19:57] wanted you you guys to know if I should
[00:19:58] watch or not now here's I'm being fully
[00:20:01] honest with you guys the genin team was
[00:20:04] like like I work with genin and they
[00:20:05] were like do you want to watch the Hoya
[00:20:06] thing I was like sure if my chat wants
[00:20:08] to so I didn't like it's hash add if we
[00:20:12] watch it but I don't have to watch it so
[00:20:13] if you guys want to watch it we can if
[00:20:15] you don't we don't have to
[00:20:18] um but I want to watch at least the
[00:20:20] genin part from my well I don't we don't
[00:20:22] really have to but from my understanding
[00:20:25] half bits genin half bits Star rail Tad
[00:20:27] is also half half right now of yes and
[00:20:30] no so I don't know um I'm probably going
[00:20:34] to watch an hour of it do a poll we can
[00:20:39] do a
[00:20:40] poll I saw the art the art was [ __ ]
[00:20:42] fire did you guys see the art dude if
[00:20:43] any of these get if any of these become
[00:20:46] outfits in game I will cream like like
[00:20:49] respectfully
[00:20:51] respectfully respectfully because I
[00:20:53] don't know what artists they hire but
[00:20:54] they're

[00:20:58] up have you guys seen

[00:21:41] chat chat could you imagine if we get
[00:21:43] any of these that's not even all okay
[00:21:45] it's not loading that's not even look
[00:21:47] look look
[00:21:51] look
[00:21:57] bro
[00:22:05] AA this is the starv
[00:22:08] one wait where's the CFA one I saw cfco
[00:22:10] it was pretty sick was that up did I
[00:22:12] miss
[00:22:13] it I forgot about this one the problem
[00:22:16] with this one though is that okay the
[00:22:18] problem with this one though is that the
[00:22:19] team comp doesn't make sense ne's there
[00:22:21] in a non- bloom team she's not going to
[00:22:22] [ __ ] do anything her passive B Works
[00:22:24] Shen or it does work with Yan but you
[00:22:26] need another dendro or Hydro your team
[00:22:28] both uh to complete the four characters
[00:22:30] de also doesn't really have relevance
[00:22:32] here Shena doesn't work without other
[00:22:34] characters but they do look visually
[00:22:36] pleasing I would say Shena is cheating
[00:22:38] because of how her model is built so I
[00:22:40] tend to automatically ignore her however
[00:22:42] nuu with the lap Cod does look good de
[00:22:44] looks amazing as always yol's not really
[00:22:47] uh dressed for racing but what would I
[00:22:49] know I don't know how to dress so I
[00:22:52] won't judge uh uh and overall not bad
[00:22:54] overall not bad my favorite is still um
[00:22:57] um this one one though this one still my
[00:23:00] favorite personally
[00:23:05] personally
[00:23:12] personally show the nevi real oh I saw
[00:23:16] that one

[00:23:47] crap
[00:23:51] sorry yeah I saw they misspelled two
[00:23:53] words but it is what it is that
[00:23:55] happens the amount of times I
[00:23:57] mispronounce a word in a in a in a video
[00:23:59] that probably doesn't even take half the
[00:24:00] time that they took to make this all
[00:24:02] good but yeah I mean someone probably
[00:24:04] should have noticed but it is what it
[00:24:13] is we can look at the there's a few of
[00:24:17] them let me pull up the calf
[00:24:19] going there's the calf going one I saw
[00:24:22] the calf going it made me very happy was
[00:24:23] there a blade one I don't
[00:24:25] remember I don't have like notification
[00:24:28] on so I miss a lot of
[00:24:37] it also dude I saw okay not to talk too
[00:24:41] much about star Rail and gance stream
[00:24:42] but I saw some [ __ ] dude I saw
[00:24:44] people being like outraged at how Ron
[00:24:47] May is like unethical bro
[00:24:52] listen bro who cares it's a video game
[00:24:56] also dude also listen
[00:25:01] listen let me let me think of my words
[00:25:03] carefully before I
[00:25:19] speak use the cards
[00:25:22] true okay okay I'm pulling a card holy
[00:25:26] smoke
[00:25:29] listen first of all I I mean okay listen
[00:25:32] I'm not going to be the board of ethics
[00:25:34] and and what is right and what isn't
[00:25:35] right but I will say that
[00:25:39] one villains are hotter
[00:25:44] two if if any genin character or or Star
[00:25:49] real character let's say think of the
[00:25:50] worst person you can think of right
[00:25:52] think of I'm not going to name any names
[00:25:54] because then it'll get clipped but think
[00:25:55] of the worst person you can think of
[00:25:57] okay if that person was added to genin
[00:26:00] or star or whatever
[00:26:02] game but looked like Kafka you would
[00:26:05] have you would excuse them and I don't
[00:26:07] think that's listen I'm not saying
[00:26:08] that's okay I'm not saying that's not
[00:26:10] okay I'm just saying it is what it is
[00:26:12] and that's usually how it works now with
[00:26:15] that said with that said with that
[00:26:23] said I forgive D Tor no I don't no I
[00:26:26] don't okay I don't forgive him for what
[00:26:28] he has done or what he may have done but
[00:26:31] I would like to play him look I would
[00:26:33] like him to die a brutal death I hope
[00:26:35] when he comes out he dies I hope in the
[00:26:37] story dor dies but I hope he he's
[00:26:40] playable I hope oh you can play him but
[00:26:42] he's dead but you can play him like like
[00:26:44] like senorita Senora Senora is dead but
[00:26:46] you you we can play her we can play her
[00:26:48] right we can
[00:26:55] play maybe we might be able to to play
[00:26:57] her hopefully and and even if we even
[00:27:01] listen I'm just saying characters can be
[00:27:04] villains but let me play them okay I'm
[00:27:05] not excusing their actions look I'm not
[00:27:08] condoning them but let me play them
[00:27:10] that's
[00:27:14] it Dori killed
[00:27:17] children in a video game which is why
[00:27:20] you shouldn't kill children that's not
[00:27:22] okay but do you know what is okay having
[00:27:24] a playable character even if that
[00:27:26] character is evil that would be cool
[00:27:28] that character should die that character
[00:27:30] should die but we should be able to play
[00:27:33] them that is
[00:27:36] cool the actions he did isn't cool but
[00:27:38] his design could
[00:27:42] be no he's just a silly goose no no no
[00:27:46] no okay anyways uh uh so let's get let's

[01:41:27] study toch some important documents 2
[01:41:31] minutes later the maid one miss Brios
[01:41:35] entered the study to find the host M
[01:41:40] gallette had been
[01:41:41] slain his name is m
[01:41:45] gallet even even the most cursory of
[01:41:49] glances could see the blue tint of his
[01:41:51] skin clear evidence of
[01:41:55] Suffocation venty You're A Vision bear
[01:41:59] are you not why of course my element is
[01:42:02] animal light and free as the
[01:42:07] breeze okay animal the element of air
[01:42:12] your honor the evidence clearly suggest
[01:42:16] it that the accused Mastery ofal to p
[01:42:21] the very air from the room painlessly
[01:42:24] ending the poor Miss glette is that
[01:42:28] really something an animal Vision can
[01:42:31] do very well how these are voices so
[01:42:33] well did that what I was saying by all
[01:42:35] means this illustration is a faithful
[01:42:38] Recreation of the scene correct down to
[01:42:42] the Last Detail why H then it is as I
[01:42:47] suspected in this sketch lies the pro of
[01:42:51] my client's
[01:42:52] innocence what how can you be so sure
[01:42:56] your honor if I may direct your ATT oh
[01:43:00] [ __ ] tell me he said you're
[01:43:02] wrong well I see some books it's the
[01:43:06] Pyro archon cuz pyro and the candle's
[01:43:09] wake it's still lit a simple lesson in
[01:43:13] the Natural Sciences unless produced by
[01:43:16] a vision Flames require oxygen to burn
[01:43:20] the as you say had the air pulled from
[01:43:23] it then the candle that's why the goat
[01:43:25] po din host would have been
[01:43:30] snu objection all you have proven is
[01:43:34] that the candle was lit after the
[01:43:38] Mur
[01:43:39] re true actually I'm with finina now
[01:43:42] then how does one explain the on the
[01:43:44] victim true I'm in the now section of
[01:43:47] the air leaving the room would have
[01:43:48] doubtlessly scattered them and he would
[01:43:51] not have had time to do the deed then
[01:43:53] reorder the papers in alphabetical order
[01:43:57] no
[01:43:58] l c is she's completely
[01:44:02] right this leaves but one conclusion
[01:44:06] venty could not have committed the crime
[01:44:09] rather the true culprit
[01:44:12] was Madame croissant in the study of
[01:44:19] course
[01:44:21] yes clue oh you killed her I love that
[01:44:23] board game growing up what is that a
[01:44:27] [ __ ] clue

[01:44:32] playing clue so same time next
[01:44:37] month wait that's sick they should make
[01:44:39] that an event I suppose I should be
[01:44:41] happy that the true culprit was found
[01:44:45] now there's nothing left to do but
[01:44:46] arrange the burial for the late mure he
[01:44:49] had no dude okay low key the voices
[01:44:52] sounded so good I wasn't sure if they Ed
[01:44:54] like voice from the game were those like
[01:44:56] separate people talking that was really
[01:44:58] good the only time okay not to Flame
[01:45:01] this person cuz they also did good but
[01:45:02] the only time I was like I thought it
[01:45:04] was like voice clips from the game until
[01:45:06] never spoke but after he kept talking it
[01:45:08] actually turned it sounded more like
[01:45:10] never that it was the first time it hit
[01:45:11] me but after that everything else
[01:45:13] was it's actually really
[01:45:18] good D the fre sounded like I I don't

[02:29:56] Navia Geo infusion see you're lucky my
[02:29:58] genin isn't loading because I'm on a

[02:30:26] uh in game Nava's uh uh the passive says
[02:30:30] this Jew infusion cannot be overridden
[02:30:32] by any other infusion or just can't be
[02:30:34] overridden uh and this is true with
[02:30:36] basically every new infusion added to
[02:30:39] the game where they said you know what
[02:30:40] [ __ ] you Bennett [ __ ] your C6 [ __ ] you
[02:30:43] I'm not being
[02:30:45] overridden
[02:30:46] the only real problems for C6 Bennett
[02:30:50] are like physical like Ula because for
[02:30:52] the most part if a character infuses
[02:30:54] themselves Bennett won't override it but
[02:30:56] old characters yeah you could kaching
[02:30:59] pyro too like the old characters but
[02:31:01] like
[02:31:03] yeah it's mostly the new characters that
[02:31:05] won't get
[02:31:06] infused but it doesn't ruin them like
[02:31:08] it's you're not going to
[02:31:10] like

[03:04:21] Kora uh while we're here we might as
[03:04:23] well it would be inefficient okay
[03:04:24] genuinely even from a resin efficiency
[03:04:26] standpoint it would be inefficient for
[03:04:28] me being capped on resin to not do the
[03:04:30] domain I'm right next to do we all agree
[03:04:32] do we all agree press one if you agree

[03:05:27] try a team of people with various skill
[03:05:30] sets
[03:05:34] invited
[03:05:36] [Music]
[03:05:37] cu9 I heard you like more than one
[03:05:39] gender does that mean you also like
[03:05:42] women or or are that just the French
[03:05:45] talking
[03:05:48] what how do you have so much resin I
[03:05:50] showed you guys the tack earlier it was
[03:05:53] the rizzly
[03:05:55] tack is vett still using healing bonus I
[03:05:58] don't think
[03:06:00] so he on
[03:06:02] noblis we were playing Navia actually
[03:06:04] we're going to play some more Navia it's
[03:06:06] been a while cuz I haven't streamed for
[03:06:07] a little bit my bad let's play some more
[03:06:09] Navia and my last stream was star rail
[03:06:11] um let's play some Navia
[03:06:14] we'll play her
[03:06:16] with who should we play her
[03:06:22] with uh I want friendship we'll do uh
[03:06:25] we'll do rizle okay it yeah I'll do my
[03:06:28] best but I can't guarantee a
[03:06:32] victory
[03:06:39] gomc dude I saw okay I don't know why
[03:06:42] I'm just unleashing in my rage and
[03:06:44] everything I see on my Twitter for you
[03:06:45] page but I saw look no disrespect to
[03:06:48] this person at all but I saw an account
[03:06:50] that was like dedicated the Gio that
[03:06:52] didn't have albo or Jang Lee and it's
[03:06:54] like look play for fun play who you like
[03:06:57] that is great but dude it is so sad
[03:07:00] playing a Geo Team without jeang Le or
[03:07:03] albo it's actually like depression it is
[03:07:06] so sad it's actually
[03:07:09] like but it's okay if you have like Noel
[03:07:11] Navia and a finina team like no finina
[03:07:14] pretty good I'm just saying it is very
[03:07:17] sad um if you're like hey man fre play
[03:07:20] slider no it's not because if you're a
[03:07:22] Geo I don't think okay na'vi is an
[03:07:24] exception Navi is good even on her own
[03:07:26] for the most part outside of Navia I
[03:07:29] think if you're a Gio if you like Gio
[03:07:33] you should invest in Gio and pull for
[03:07:34] more than one Gio character if I don't
[03:07:36] recommend Gio from like meta Wise It's
[03:07:38] not like the best but if you're like yo
[03:07:41] I [ __ ] love Gio I want to playo I
[03:07:42] play W whatever you should pull another
[03:07:44] GE character at that point J Lee albo
[03:07:47] very worth well or one of the two not
[03:07:50] necessarily both but Navia is good
[03:07:52] basically always I just don't really
[03:07:54] like the other Geo options that aren't
[03:07:55] Jang Le or albo if you have Navia run
[03:07:57] her with either Jong or albo or a
[03:08:00] support that's not Gio you could do geom
[03:08:02] MC I know it's fine but it's just at
[03:08:06] that point I would rather run a battery
[03:08:08] of a different element like FAL or like
[03:08:10] a Shang Ling Bennett whatever for the
[03:08:12] most most part but you can still do it
[03:08:15] but yeah it's just the downgrade if you
[03:08:16] don't have Al J is kind of sad that's
[03:08:19] all but G gives you crit rate and has
[03:08:22] okay damage not not good damage but
[03:08:24] damage why are my chats different I see
[03:08:26] two chats right
[03:08:36] now wait why okay I don't know why

[03:14:28] okay
[03:14:32] however
[03:14:33] however and you're not allowed to type
[03:14:35] if you pulled for one of the character
[03:14:37] but not the other
[03:14:38] okay however in your opinion chat just
[03:14:42] so I no Public public uh I gauge the
[03:14:44] public
[03:14:45] opinion Nev uh sorry not Nev Navia or Al
[03:15:03] them tendra versus Gio okay I
[03:15:07] mean I think Navia is very satisfying so
[03:15:10] she's going to skew people well it's not
[03:15:12] even just skew I think also it's like
[03:15:14] it's pretty practical to be able to just
[03:15:16] one-hot stuff like it makes your
[03:15:18] effective clear time a lot slower I
[03:15:19] sorry faster if you can
[03:15:22] like just do 100K without having to do a
[03:15:24] full
[03:15:26] rotation but yeah I am uh I'm still an
[03:15:28] alyen
[03:15:34] [Music]
[03:15:39] believer yeah Al them's AOE is also
[03:15:41] pretty stupid the mirrors are really
[03:15:43] good Navas are Navia always
[03:15:47] weird your plunges do 100K each yeah
[03:15:50] that's
[03:15:51] true that's ALS dude that's the thing
[03:15:53] with Shia cuz look look no I have C6
[03:15:56] fars on I can't
[03:16:02] talk but the thing with Shia is like
[03:16:04] once you're at my investment level and I
[03:16:06] know like not most people aren't okay so
[03:16:08] I'm not acting like oh you have to be a
[03:16:10] whale it's like C zero shop okay if you
[03:16:13] have C Faron it's like your plunges are
[03:16:15] doing so much and their AOE it it just
[03:16:18] feels so good okay feels crafting I know
[03:16:20] but bro I'm telling you it is a little
[03:16:23] slept on that's all I'm
[03:16:32] saying and I'm saying this now before
[03:16:34] Shia may or may not get better in case
[03:16:36] he does who knows Lantern R might happen
[03:16:39] just because I know there's going to be
[03:16:41] the oh he's goodness listen I hope he
[03:16:44] gets better I do I I do but I'm just
[03:16:51] saying I am happy as I
[03:16:55] stand porn
[03:17:02] acting
[03:17:05] Suk I only hear people assuming stuff's
[03:17:09] going to happen but I don't know
[03:17:10] anything I I purposefully don't look at
[03:17:13] anything so I don't have to fake
[03:17:14] anything when it if anything happens so
[03:17:17] I'm in a state where like I hear people
[03:17:19] talking but I willing F don't look at
[03:17:21] anything so that I don't know anything
[03:17:23] does that make sense that makes
[03:17:27] sense
[03:17:41] team
[03:17:42] yeah to be fair the last like I'm okay
[03:17:45] zero copium and this is a big affector
[03:17:48] of public opinion the last two maybe
[03:17:51] three abysses have been [ __ ]
[03:17:53] disgusting dog water poop balls for it's
[03:17:58] been so dude it's actually been like
[03:18:00] biased against us your on it you need
[03:18:03] like eight elements per
[03:18:05] half's light it up which is another
[03:18:08] reason why hyper Loom is good despite
[03:18:09] the people telling you hyper Loom is it
[03:18:11] you actually have very useful elements
[03:18:13] like dendro Hydro Electro and then
[03:18:15] whatever the [ __ ] you want wow that's
[03:18:19] cool but
[03:18:21] yeah not wrong so much an emo resistance
[03:18:23] yeah it's really hard to play Shia on
[03:18:25] either half not like I don't think it's
[03:18:27] like his fault it's a lot of just like
[03:18:29] the enemies aren't made for him which
[03:18:31] happens miss the point of the video I
[03:18:33] don't care we're not talking about it
[03:18:35] shut up you're trying to get me
[03:18:41] stunlocked
[03:18:53] you just unlock yourself
[03:18:59] true this one's got your name on it just
[03:19:03] because listen okay not to against the
[03:19:05] Lo again it's just because it went from
[03:19:08] hey stop recommending hyper Bloom to
[03:19:10] title change a while after may maybe
[03:19:13] it's not as broken as you think it's
[03:19:15] like bro I only got stun locked because
[03:19:17] it was titled hey stop recommending it
[03:19:20] people are lying to you which isn't true

[03:19:57] you let's light it up let's light it
[03:20:03] up I'm going in Strike
[03:20:07] A Feeling
[03:20:09] Lucky coming at you but yeah I think um
[03:20:13] your mic peaked really I need to fix my
[03:20:15] audio settings a little bit here if I'm
[03:20:17] ever had to set up
[03:20:19] um
[03:20:22] anyways what was I
[03:20:24] saying yeah I think Navia is is the
[03:20:27] least geo geo character which makes her
[03:20:29] pretty good that's what I'm happy about
[03:20:31] although she makes crystallize useful
[03:20:33] well she makes you want to crystallize
[03:20:35] which is
[03:20:36] cool even though the crystallized
[03:20:38] Shields actually don't do
[03:20:40] anything
[03:20:47] yeah the stream crashed
[03:20:49] earlier what kind of chair do you
[03:20:51] recommend I recommend office chairs I'm
[03:20:54] using a random one I got from Amazon for
[03:20:55] like I think 100 but at home I have uh
[03:20:58] the mo probably the only expensive no
[03:21:01] not the only but one of the few
[03:21:02] expensive purchases I've made outside of
[03:21:04] just a good computer is uh I got a
[03:21:06] [ __ ] office chair like a Herman
[03:21:08] Miller I I don't know I think it was
[03:21:09] worth I think gaming chairs I use I Ed
[03:21:12] one for like 10 years dude it does not
[03:21:14] support your back I'm sorry there might
[03:21:16] be some that do but for the most part
[03:21:17] it's like offic shs are so much better
[03:21:19] so uh Herman Miller you want to sponsor
[03:21:21] me
[03:21:22] sorry to shine wailing on teras I heard
[03:21:26] someone say I think it was a streamer I
[03:21:28] don't remember who that they'd rather
[03:21:29] spend money on a good office chair than
[03:21:32] on a [ __ ] like spine replacement
[03:21:35] surgery or whatever get scoliosis and
[03:21:37] honestly I agree it has a 10year
[03:21:39] warranty and I was like [ __ ] it
[03:21:42] so I think it's worth it but you can get
[03:21:43] cheap ones like there's a whole
[03:21:44] subreddit about it like afford like
[03:21:47] affordable ones that would last you
[03:21:49] forever or not forever but a long time I
[03:21:51] think it's worth it and this is coming
[03:21:53] from someone who has like 50 emails from
[03:21:55] like DX racer and gaming Brands like yo
[03:21:58] use our chair and I just haven't
[03:21:59] responded
[03:22:01] but nothing against them no
[03:22:04] disrespect but I'm just more of
[03:22:07] a I'm more of a office chair
[03:22:10] Andy
[03:22:14] feeling lucky [ __ ] I can't
[03:22:22] there stri my posture is ass but like I
[03:22:27] try to I try to keep it straight my

[03:22:49] slouching give there
[03:23:02] 18 you are
[03:23:04] slouching okay why is the full pres to a
[03:23:07] second hand oh no you absolutely should
[03:23:08] secondhand it but yeah I definitely just
[03:23:11] I bought a new one cuz did 10- year
[03:23:13] warranty like I would how much okay how
[03:23:15] much is it let me look it
[03:23:17] up like it's a lot and I don't recommend
[03:23:20] getting it new you should definitely get
[03:23:21] it used however I just divided it by 10
[03:23:23] because it has a 10-e warranty so it's
[03:23:25] like what I'm spending is for 10 years
[03:23:27] minimum cuz it's probably more or like
[03:23:30] realistically you might eventually like
[03:23:31] move out or whatever but like I don't
[03:23:34] know not to be it like this isn't
[03:23:36] sponsored I just my mindset was like
[03:23:38] [ __ ] it like I'm sitting down literally
[03:23:41] 12 hours a day not moving maybe walking
[03:23:45] for an hour I might as well [ __ ] have
[03:23:47] a good
[03:23:53] chair oh they already can
[03:23:58] I you be sitting on a chair for 10 years
[03:24:00] yes absolutely do you think I'm ever
[03:24:03] going to go touch grass what do you
[03:24:05] think I'm going to do in [ __ ] 10
[03:24:06] years probably still be on a chair well
[03:24:08] like either I'm streaming or it doesn't
[03:24:10] work out and I'm studying law or like
[03:24:12] I'm a lawyer either way I'm going to be
[03:24:14] in a
[03:24:22] chair not how depreciation Works
[03:24:24] depreciate okay depreciation doesn't why
[03:24:27] would it matter if I'm never going to
[03:24:28] sell it and I'm going to keep it the
[03:24:29] whole time and it's not going to get
[03:24:31] damaged unless it does within 10 years
[03:24:33] and I'm going to replace it and if it
[03:24:34] does after 10 years then whatever it was
[03:24:36] worth it because however much for
[03:24:38] however many years why would it like
[03:24:40] it's like if you're if you're you're
[03:24:41] buying a watch and you plan on selling
[03:24:43] it in 20 years okay you care about what
[03:24:45] changes to it if it [ __ ] gets damag
[03:24:47] or if the price goes up or down but if
[03:24:48] it's a chair you're going to sit on for
[03:24:50] 10 years it's either going to be good
[03:24:52] quality or you're going to replace it
[03:24:53] for
[03:24:56] free anyways you know lawyers have to
[03:24:59] walk and stand really I don't know my
[03:25:02] brother's a lawyer he's been a lawyer
[03:25:03] for 10 years I've seen him walk and
[03:25:05] stand once a year to go to court 90% of
[03:25:07] the time you're [ __ ] sitting down at
[03:25:09] your desk or you're like yeah you'll go
[03:25:11] to but outside that you're sitting at
[03:25:12] your [ __ ]
[03:25:14] desk you are you're literally sitting or
[03:25:17] like at home if you're working from home
[03:25:19] you're
[03:25:38] sitting shower me with prise
[03:25:48] no but my point is it replace the chair
[03:25:50] within 10 years it's like it probably
[03:25:51] won't need to be replaced but that's a
[03:25:53] good thing just assume it lasts 10 years
[03:25:54] if it lasts more that's a win but like
[03:25:57] if it lasts me at least 10
[03:26:00] years I think that's worth
[03:26:02] it this's got your on
[03:26:07] it a moment
[03:26:10] please
[03:26:12] hey
[03:26:14] there why are you still talking about a
[03:26:16] chair lol W do you want me to talk about
[03:26:18] hyper blo again is that what you want
[03:26:20] because I will no I happily will matter
[03:26:22] of fact I will gladly talk to you about
[03:26:25] hyper
[03:26:30] Bloom two month stunlock LOL
[03:26:34] W shower me with time to
[03:26:37] shine why do they never
[03:26:40] miss
[03:26:42] Mr Tony the warranty comes with it and
[03:26:44] yes I get it they probably buil
[03:26:46] something that won't break in 10 years
[03:26:47] that they 10 year warranty you which is
[03:26:49] a selling point but if my point is I can
[03:26:51] keep it for 10 years and then after I
[03:26:53] can burn it in a fire would it still be
[03:26:55] worth the money and for me it might not
[03:26:58] be for you well there's cares of
[03:26:59] different price points but like for me I
[03:27:01] was like you know what if it lasts at
[03:27:03] least 10 years and I have good like
[03:27:05] decent polish within 10 years then I'm
[03:27:07] happy to make that it's like if if I
[03:27:09] pull on a character I know that money's
[03:27:11] gone I know it's
[03:27:14] gone
[03:27:18] but it makes me feel like I'm I'm
[03:27:20] helping my posture even if it doesn't a
[03:27:23] little raid oh the day reset
[03:27:25] aware stun locked l
[03:27:29] w look at my imposter look at this look
[03:27:31] at this look at this look at this look
[03:27:32] at this look at this okay but this chair

[03:30:40] down inside yeah the ER calculator might
[03:30:42] say 140 might even say 160 but if you're
[03:30:45] [ __ ] one-shotting things and getting

[03:47:06] so much better is this what you guys
[03:47:09] normally see this actually looks so much
[03:47:10] better than what I'm used to like I'm on
[03:47:13] like a disgusting saturated valerant
[03:47:15] tuned monitor it looks so bad compared

[03:53:39] the Genji main of League no I
[03:53:43] wasn't no rest for the
[03:53:51] wicked that was literally
[03:53:58] Yasuo should have used finina heal
[03:54:07] true
[03:54:09] Navia musle like net um uh
[03:54:16] no all we're waiting 28 seconds so how
[03:54:19] was your day mine was good thanks for
[03:54:21] asking I was good I was
[03:54:28] good how was
[03:54:37] yours ow
[03:54:39] where did that come from is K a must
[03:54:42] pull in 2024 that's bait I'm going to go
[03:54:45] through your chogs to confirm that's
[03:54:46] bait if it's bait 24-hour timeout if
[03:54:49] it's a genuine question I will answer
[03:54:53] it no this has to be bait still stun
[03:54:56] locked we can't yeah
[03:55:05] yeah let's go find some treasure
[03:55:09] okay you're not going to get timed out
[03:55:10] though because there's a chance it's
[03:55:11] genuine but that has to be
[03:55:23] bait the
[03:55:25] world well is
[03:55:34] heant he
[03:55:36] there look okay I'm going to say this
[03:55:38] once and I'm going to say this only once
[03:55:40] until I repeat it in like [ __ ] two
[03:55:44] weeks
[03:55:45] I am in the middle stay in the Middle
[03:55:49] where I hate the calling characters
[03:55:51] Muses because it implies something that
[03:55:53] it shed in a gacha game that is very
[03:55:55] easy and that has Replacements the
[03:55:57] character that you think is a musle like
[03:55:59] sucros now with that said I'm I'm in the
[03:56:01] middle because I also understand what
[03:56:03] most people hear when they hear mus oh
[03:56:06] okay character is really good makes your
[03:56:08] life a lot easier okay okay oh Hydro
[03:56:11] goet okay with that in mind okay I
[03:56:15] understand the dichotomy here new word
[03:56:16] write that down I don't know if it
[03:56:17] applies in this context but I'm going to
[03:56:18] assume it does so write that down listen
[03:56:21] dichotomy d
[03:56:22] i toy
[03:56:25] listen I don't think characters are mus
[03:56:28] I don't think that's a label that I
[03:56:29] would give to characters however in
[03:56:31] terms of improving your quality of life
[03:56:33] team performance and capabilities like
[03:56:36] grouping exploration just even like as I
[03:56:39] said with grouping like grouping the B
[03:56:40] mobs that are [ __ ] annoying clearing
[03:56:42] content on their own breaking Elemental
[03:56:43] Shields and just giving you quality of
[03:56:45] life upgrades as well as enabling some
[03:56:46] teams that want Elemental damage bonus
[03:56:48] where an em buffer like suas wouldn't
[03:56:49] really work Kwa is very high value would
[03:56:53] I say you have to pull for him or you're
[03:56:54] dumb no but what I say is very high
[03:56:56] value
[03:56:58] yeah but if you're like dude I'm I'm
[03:57:00] free to play I don't want to spend money
[03:57:02] I need to save for [ __ ] I don't know
[03:57:05] [ __ ] Mia arino sorry that was I'm
[03:57:08] sorry I didn't mean to say it like that
[03:57:10] I apologize to all our Lino Watchers or
[03:57:12] to uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh I know I'm
[03:57:16] sorry Mafia is an aesthetic I apologize
[03:57:19] however if you want to pull for
[03:57:23] her she what if she comes out next patch
[03:57:26] that would be cool what if she comes out
[03:57:27] in two patches what if she doesn't did
[03:57:29] my mic [ __ ] up my mic [ __ ] up I hit my
[03:57:32] desk again stop hitting your desk stop
[03:57:34] hitting your
[03:57:37] desk is it okay wait let
[03:57:42] me really okay I reset it is it fine I
[03:57:45] don't know I don't mind where we go as
[03:57:47] long as I anyways doesn't matter my
[03:57:49] point was please let me
[03:57:55] restart let me
[03:57:58] restart he's about him and Nita I'd say
[03:58:01] are as high value as a against
[03:58:04] but if you're like yo I'm free to play I
[03:58:07] really want an UPC character I really
[03:58:10] want whoever the [ __ ] and you'd be sad
[03:58:11] if you don't get
[03:58:15] them then as much as I think Kazo makes
[03:58:18] your life better and easier you don't
[03:58:20] need to go for him if there's someone
[03:58:22] you're waiting for and you don't want to
[03:58:24] spend money or won't have enough gems to
[03:58:26] get them
[03:58:29] bothe smiley
[03:58:37] face
[03:58:46] is this no talking streamer what does
[03:58:48] that mean can you explain hyper Bloom
[03:58:51] don't talk to
[03:58:55] me I'm actually what the [ __ ] I'm dying
[03:58:58] I made a I recorded a full video on the
[03:59:01] characters I think are the highest pull
[03:59:02] value I recorded this literally over
[03:59:04] like two weeks ago at this point this
[03:59:06] was before Navia came out but anyways it
[03:59:08] was going to be a top five I ended up
[03:59:09] talking about like 15 like no not 15
[03:59:11] like 12 characters so uh stay tuned for
[03:59:13] that if you want a video it probably be
[03:59:14] like 20 to 30 minutes uh just talk about
[03:59:17] who's the highest pull value and when
[03:59:19] certain characters are really good to
[03:59:20] pull for and stuff like that but it
[03:59:23] isn't in like a specific I tried to I
[03:59:25] tried to be smart with it and not like
[03:59:27] number characters cuz that's weird and
[03:59:29] instead I talked about them in sort of
[03:59:32] an order of like like sort of an order
[03:59:35] of
[03:59:36] like most valuable for most
[03:59:40] players that's pretty cool tldr although
[03:59:44] there's a lot more information it's
[03:59:46] usually Kazu and aita and then a [ __ ]
[03:59:48] ton of hydro characters but not all of
[03:59:50] them I'll explain more in the video but
[03:59:52] like you know if you already have three
[03:59:54] good Hydro characters then the fourth
[03:59:56] one even if it's like an amazing oh my
[03:59:58] God you need Yan oh my God you need
[03:59:59] finina you already have three like
[04:00:00] broken Hydro characters the more you get
[04:00:04] the less they're valuable but still can
[04:00:06] be good uh I'm out of artifact in
[04:00:08] inventory because we need the straw
[04:00:09] walks for a
[04:00:13] million is there a character that can
[04:00:14] use HP ciret yes uh nevet is an example
[04:00:17] especially you have a high crit
[04:00:18] investment yolan is an example outside
[04:00:21] of that it could be like substat
[04:00:22] dependent like uh forina you typically
[04:00:25] go crit but like can be subat dependent
[04:00:27] depending on like what you have maybe
[04:00:28] you have like an ER Sands don't have
[04:00:30] that much
[04:00:31] HP um but for the most part yeah like
[04:00:33] net yolon my yolon has a hp1 I think um
[04:00:38] um Benny's Adventure team where the [ __ ]
[04:00:41] is
[04:00:44] he okay that's kind of not the best Rao
[04:00:46] right now but like I use this on her
[04:00:49] really good J Lee yeah but J Le doesn't
[04:00:51] need the like 40 crit value or whatever
[04:00:53] they said I mean you can with Navia
[04:00:56] honestly I think um a Jong Le that can
[04:00:59] actually use his burst is more valuable
[04:01:01] so
[04:01:07] yeah
[04:01:09] should I get nevet if I have child yolan
[04:01:14] finina
[04:01:16] maybe I mean is he still is he going to
[04:01:19] be broken anytime you use him yeah do
[04:01:20] you need another DPS that's Hydro Maybe
[04:01:23] not
[04:01:24] maybe are you going to use him if you
[04:01:26] want to use him yeah get him but he's
[04:01:28] not like as high like he's not like
[04:01:31] required for you cuz if you have finina
[04:01:33] yolan for one team and then child like
[04:01:35] let's say Shang Ling Bennett for the
[04:01:36] other team you're gonna clear so at that
[04:01:38] point it's like do you want to have
[04:01:40] another DPS if yes get them if not
[04:01:46] no but also you don't have an on a Hydra
[04:01:49] on Fielder outside of child and child's
[04:01:50] really good for like one maybe two teams
[04:01:53] outside that he's like
[04:01:55] fine so net would replace
[04:02:03] that why is Charlotte on a one star set
[04:02:06] what do you mean I love Charlotte she's
[04:02:09] on um yeah she's the traveling doctor
[04:02:12] she travels she wants to
[04:02:14] heal yeah makes sense
[04:02:25] yeah she's an
[04:02:37] adventurer
[04:02:46] why are we still listening to NPC EDM
[04:02:48] that is a good question that I just
[04:02:49] asked
[04:02:54] myself oh God that was an unshuffle okay
[04:03:01] whatever [ __ ]
[04:03:07] it
[04:03:14] wait how long does it say I've been live
[04:03:15] for let me

[04:03:51] the abyss reset and then I'll be back

[04:04:28] [ __ ] million ping it has the randomst
[04:04:31] [ __ ] characters and gear the only

[04:06:38] kind of didn't explore as much but like
[04:06:40] this part so this was fine upper lower
[04:06:43] s's fine this [ __ ] pyramid kind of
[04:06:45] tilted me because there's I don't know
[04:06:47] but it was cool to explore it I have not
[04:06:49] even done it but I got to go back and
[04:06:52] then this part I kind of I haven't

[04:07:59] attack okay I can't think of anything
[04:08:02] name on
[04:08:06] it
[04:08:11] [ __ ] this one's got your name on
[04:08:15] iter
[04:08:18] me watch this chat watch this got your
[04:08:21] name on
[04:08:35] it I think Gio will be a lot better when
[04:08:38] we get the fouille geomancer and we get
[04:08:40] to use Geo infused characters cuz Geo
[04:08:42] kaching or Gio alham Geo sha like Geo
[04:08:46] punes for crystalize would be really
[04:08:47] cool uh so I'm excited for that
[04:08:49] hopefully it comes out soon um but we
[04:08:51] don't really you know we don't talk
[04:08:53] about leaks so we'll
[04:09:05] see why does tra switch back after
[04:09:14] everything are you not thirsty I will
[04:09:16] hydrate just for
[04:09:36] you
[04:09:39] what are you drinking bro what the [ __ ]
[04:09:41] does it look
[04:09:46] like it's
[04:09:48] water oh speaking of which I don't know
[04:09:50] if I should admit to this is this a
[04:09:52] crime okay a legend it wasn't me it was
[04:09:54] actually my brother but we had to like
[04:09:56] smuggle in okay I don't know am I
[04:09:58] allowed to say this we had to like
[04:09:59] smuggle in like alcohol that looked like
[04:10:04] uh like like in like a water bottle just
[04:10:05] a little bit of like of like Al that
[04:10:07] looked like a water to my grandma in the
[04:10:09] hospital cuz she needed to like rub it
[04:10:11] on her forehead or sniff it it's like
[04:10:13] this Lebanese like not Lebanese it's
[04:10:15] like Arabic alcohol but like 70% alcohol
[04:10:17] and it [ __ ] like it's basically like
[04:10:19] absence but it's like licorice I don't
[04:10:21] know how to explain it but it's
[04:10:22] basically just like this really strong
[04:10:23] alcohol that looks like water and so we
[04:10:25] put it in a water bottle cuz my grandma
[04:10:27] needed it and we had to like yeah to
[04:10:29] like smuggle it
[04:10:30] [Music]
[04:10:32] in but
[04:10:34] anyways hopefully hopefully the cops
[04:10:36] aren't looking for me
[04:10:39] why are you confessing allegedly I
[04:10:41] didn't do it I actually didn't do it
[04:10:42] light it
[04:10:48] up right let me heal
[04:10:50] everyone
[04:10:56] no this one's got your name on
[04:11:04] it wait okay be normal dude I've
[04:11:06] literally [ __ ] my reactions up to
[04:11:08] where like I genuinely now almost moan
[04:11:11] calm the [ __ ] down
[04:11:14] whoa yo what is
[04:11:18] this this is actually sick three perfect
[04:11:21] sub stats HP could be good on certain
[04:11:22] characters but on the set I usually
[04:11:23] don't want it because I'd probably use
[04:11:24] this on tari or G or something um but
[04:11:28] really nice okay hopefully that rolls
[04:11:29] good you've been running for 10 years
[04:11:31] add Z that's not true Z that's not true
[04:11:35] you know it's not
[04:11:36] true
[04:11:39] you need em instead of HP it's fine
[04:11:41] because it won't roll that stat anyways
[04:11:42] it's just going to roll crit so whatever
[04:11:44] the last stat is doesn't really matter
[04:11:45] yeah one em roll one attack roll one HP
[04:11:48] roll could be nice depending on the
[04:11:50] character but it's not going to roll
[04:11:52] that stat anyways because we already
[04:11:53] know I'm from The Future Doctor Strange
[04:11:55] it's only going to roll crit uh
[04:11:59] typically I haven't rolled an artifact
[04:12:01] in that
[04:12:06] long
[04:12:08] I'm actually reformed I'm [ __ ]
[04:12:15] cured I'm [ __ ] C I'm [ __ ] cured
[04:12:18] for my artifact
[04:12:24] addiction he's
[04:12:26] cured hey they believe in us wait wait
[04:12:29] where is it where is it where is it one
[04:12:32] second
[04:12:36] chat
[04:12:39] they didn't believe in US
[04:12:43] chat it breaks my heart they ain't
[04:12:46] Believe in Us we the best music they
[04:12:50] play themselves why you hating and being
[04:12:52] jealous you could be over here embracing
[04:12:55] that love more love more blessings more
[04:12:58] life God
[04:13:04] did God did
[04:13:08] okay our first role is already not great
[04:13:10] because a lot of people on the set don't
[04:13:11] really need ER don't get me wrong it's
[04:13:14] not bad but it's not
[04:13:17] ideal however the two-piece gives you
[04:13:20] Em which makes it a bit more versatile
[04:13:23] and ER substats on certain characters
[04:13:24] isn't even
[04:13:31] bad okay so Jeff you're also in chat I
[04:13:33] want to know your take on this cuz now I
[04:13:36] haven't actually played like I I haven't
[04:13:37] rolled an artifact since the first day
[04:13:39] of the patch coming out it's been a
[04:13:40] while okay I haven't rolled my artifacts
[04:13:42] I've been far but I haven't rolled I
[04:13:44] what do you think about the new over
[04:13:46] like I think most of the new overlays
[04:13:47] are sick what do you think about the
[04:13:48] artifact one I think the option of not
[04:13:49] having the popup kind of kills the hype
[04:13:51] for me I think it's an out of touch take
[04:13:53] because as like a normal casual Andy on
[04:13:55] my phone or whatever I don't really care
[04:13:56] like I just want to get it over with
[04:13:57] fast but I feel like the hype of seeing
[04:13:59] the popup is gone for me and now it's
[04:14:01] just kind of like an arrow like oh
[04:14:04] wow I don't
[04:14:06] know
[04:14:08] maybe I'll get used to
[04:14:14] it you have the option to turn it off
[04:14:16] wait can you wait can you oh my God I
[04:14:20] will kiss you chatter no I won't that's
[04:14:21] weird but please please tell me where
[04:14:25] where
[04:14:28] where
[04:14:31] where are you [ __ ] baiting me
[04:14:36] where
[04:14:39] in the artifact
[04:14:43] screen also what happened to our Flower
[04:14:45] by the way okay
[04:14:51] yeah okay I'm getting baited you
[04:14:53] literally just baited me for no
[04:15:04] reason right there yeah yeah I'm getting
[04:15:06] one guy again
[04:15:07] that was the thing no this is for the
[04:15:09] [ __ ] auto to level it still rolls
[04:15:11] like that I'm saying I like the popup be
[04:15:13] like crit
[04:15:14] damage G rate nice it's fine though like
[04:15:17] for videos I can just zoom in there it's
[04:15:19] not a big deal but I don't know just not
[04:15:21] used to
[04:15:29] it w Wait this is the most fav piece
[04:15:33] that has ever faved what the [ __ ] this
[04:15:36] is so fav
[04:15:37] this is like Fab no not Shan she wants
[04:15:40] attack but like Fab
[04:15:42] anyone especially at HP like a
[04:15:57] Healer
[04:15:59] oh this is so
[04:16:02] disgusting um it's like really good but
[04:16:06] for no no characters like it's amazing
[04:16:09] for like the Future character that wants
[04:16:11] to fav
[04:16:16] Wanderers but I
[04:16:19] mean

[04:16:25] offie yolon offie
[04:16:30] true but it's a [ __ ] flower dude like
[04:16:33] off these flowers are kind of

[04:34:19] either is the man that cost 20 you think
[04:34:21] it's better to do it twice or use
[04:34:23] condense that's a question I haven't
[04:34:24] heard since they released condensed in
[04:34:25] like 1.2
[04:34:28] 1.4 that's a old that's an OG
[04:34:32] question another em goblet no no oh no
[04:34:36] sorry
[04:34:38] um it doesn't matter it's the exact same
[04:34:40] thing can just saves you time but it
[04:34:42] costs a crystal fly if you have them
[04:34:44] usually I used to find crystal FES
[04:34:45] annoying to farm because I spent so much
[04:34:46] resin but now they added this where
[04:34:48] there's literally six every day here
[04:34:49] boom so
[04:34:52] yeah you guys know you guys want to know
[04:34:54] zor when KZ res first came out some of
[04:34:57] you might remember probably not I used
[04:34:59] to not spend kense resin ever because I
[04:35:01] was like well this reduces how much time
[04:35:03] I have to stream by half and I have
[04:35:05] anything else to do cuz we have no
[04:35:06] content so I wouldn't spend condens
[04:35:09] resin but now it's like now there
[04:35:12] actually stuff to do
[04:35:21] so you know what item has two ends
[04:35:24] everything has two ends except the
[04:35:26] everything has an end except the banana
[04:35:27] which has
[04:35:28] two true you can quote me on
[04:35:34] that
[04:35:40] can you

[05:05:44] smart Fox will not be
[05:06:01] full CH I have a bad feeling about
[05:06:15] this maybe they don't they want me to be
[05:06:18] discouraged from Rolling cuz they know
[05:06:20] that the artifact is going to be so good
[05:06:22] that if I roll it it's going to break
[05:06:24] the game people are going to be sad
[05:06:25] seeing it they're going to be jealous
[05:06:26] they're not going to play genin it's
[05:06:28] going to mean genin players are going to
[05:06:29] quit so the game is protecting them they
[05:06:32] want more players right more players
[05:06:34] more money so they are trying to stop me
[05:06:36] from Rolling artifacts because they know
[05:06:37] that it must be my lucky day I think I'm
[05:06:40] on to something watch
