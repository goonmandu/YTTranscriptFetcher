[00:13:04] company collapsing or something I don't
[00:13:06] know I don't follow
[00:13:08] companies I'm going to say this right
[00:13:10] now because if this upsets you I uh
[00:13:12] think you have a bad uh uh uh uh brain
[00:13:16] uh in the in the educational sense uh
[00:13:18] like you need to educate yourself sense
[00:13:21] uh if you worship companies of anything
[00:13:23] you are kind of weirdchamp okay this
[00:13:25] isn't just about vtube companies also
[00:13:27] look I listen to kop I'm listening to
[00:13:29] new jeans right now well this is a Leal
[00:13:30] Legends collab I'm sorry that's kind of
[00:13:32] cringe iist you know but if you're
[00:13:34] worshiping the company they probably
[00:13:35] exploit the people there I don't know I
[00:13:37] don't know I don't know I don't know
[00:13:38] don't get M at me I don't know but
[00:13:39] probably so you know it's it's like feel
[00:13:42] like oh I couldn't see this coming what
[00:13:43] you couldn't see this coming oh I own
[00:13:45] you you do whatever I tell you to do
[00:13:47] what that company's bad what I don't
[00:13:49] know I didn't look into it though I
[00:13:50] actually don't know what's happening but
[00:13:51] I'm just saying in general usually
[00:13:52] whenever I see like big corporations
[00:13:54] doing anything with like people that
[00:13:56] like they say what to do I'm like
[00:13:57] expecting like a [ __ ] satanic ring to
[00:14:01] be
[00:14:02] exposed not literally but you know what
[00:14:04] I mean anyways uh I didn't look into it
[00:14:06] though cuz I don't feel like that but
[00:14:07] you know be careful uh well not be
[00:14:09] careful but I don't even know where I
[00:14:11] was going with
[00:14:13] that I think anyone's defending the
[00:14:15] company no obviously not but like my
[00:14:17] point is like if this is one company
[00:14:20] like there's probably like [ __ ] do

[00:23:32] arm okay really in 1.0 the only pole arm
[00:23:35] was Shang Ling which means uh right
[00:23:37] after was Shia and J Jong Le so it has

[00:23:58] not Electro Ena Zuma 2.1 Ryden Shogun
[00:24:01] came out at the same time as Sara I
[00:24:02] believe they shared the banner uh not
[00:24:04] the only thing they shared I think we
[00:24:06] could guess this it's not a PO it could
[00:24:07] be a pole arm so I think it could be
[00:24:09] Ryden um does Ryden SAR use the same
[00:24:11] book I don't know but the only other
[00:24:13] option would be a no it has to be a PO
[00:24:15] arm okay
[00:24:21] cool One Step Closer maybe soon I'll
[00:24:23] finally uncover the truth of this
[00:24:26] world wait I actually know who this is

[00:24:40] maybe this is Su like either Su or
[00:24:43] Fontan maybe soon I'll uncover the truth
[00:24:45] of this world I don't know
[00:24:48] nette uh I feel like i' dude I've
[00:24:50] definitely heard this it's like this is
[00:24:53] like the Tor man it maybe soon I'll
[00:24:56] uncover the truth of this
[00:24:59] world maybe soon I'll uncover the truth
[00:25:03] of this world let's listen let's listen
[00:25:06] let's listen everyone shut up one step
[00:25:09] closer maybe soon I shall finally
[00:25:11] uncover the truth of this world why did
[00:25:13] I think that was Far bro wait chill
[00:25:21] chill one step closer maybe soon I shall
[00:25:25] this is a very iconic voice cuz it like
[00:25:27] bounces up and down so it's very clear
[00:25:29] if you play this character you instantly
[00:25:30] know who it is now unfortunately for me
[00:25:32] I have no [ __ ] clue but I can tell
[00:25:34] that it's a distinct voice so Props to
[00:25:36] the voice actor for
[00:25:44] that um One Step Closer this gives me
[00:25:47] farizon Vibes but one step closer maybe
[00:25:50] soon I shall finally uncover the truth
[00:25:52] of this world cuz she's like have fun
[00:25:54] with this game and when she says that
[00:25:56] her voice bounces up and as like have
[00:25:58] fun with it you know so it could be that
[00:26:00] one step it had no but what if it's like
[00:26:02] Navia One Step Closer maybe Navia kind
[00:26:06] of sounds like that and I don't think
[00:26:07] farzon cares about this world does she
[00:26:09] what's the farizon
[00:26:13] lore but this sounds I feel like the
[00:26:15] Japanese voice sounds more like na uh
[00:26:17] faran than
[00:26:19] Navia one step closer that sounds like
[00:26:22] [ __ ] Navia though I just did the
[00:26:23] quest so I should know this this is
[00:26:25] literally giving me Vibes of like Mal

[00:41:34] I had my burst up where did it go got
[00:41:38] surely I'm not on
[00:41:40] shimwa
[00:41:47] noes oh not Stockholm what is the
[00:41:49] syndrome uh sorry what is it Stockholm's
[00:41:51] a different one what's the one where
[00:41:53] like you think something but it's not
[00:41:55] the case like the the like the Fruit of
[00:41:56] the Loom having the thing mandala effect
[00:41:59] that's it why did I say Stockholm yeah
[00:42:01] Mandela
[00:42:03] effect my bad that's the one I meant I
[00:42:06] didn't is ya squ still just ya BC one
[00:42:09] squ is just
[00:42:17] one are you
[00:42:19] dumb I'm sorry thanks for the 100 bits
[00:42:21] Min lemon but if you you know what I'm
[00:42:24] pulling up Ms paint
[00:42:36] if you have a a variable let's say a a
[00:42:38] could be any number okay any number and
[00:42:40] then you you multiply that number by
[00:42:43] another one okay there's a few ways to
[00:42:44] write a multiplication uh you could do
[00:42:46] an X you could do a DOT or nothing just
[00:42:49] a space for example if you write a b
[00:42:54] right this is a * B but you don't need
[00:42:56] to write that you just write a b so
[00:42:59] let's say instead of a you do ya right
[00:43:02] Y and then you put another ya this is ya
[00:43:07] time ya ya X ya or just ya ya is ya time
[00:43:12] Yao now the a number times itself uh uh
[00:43:17] well this is why you could also say like
[00:43:19] let's say ya times Yao could also be
[00:43:21] simplified by doing this you remove this
[00:43:24] Yao and then you put this to the power
[00:43:26] of two and then it will this will equal
[00:43:30] to Yao time
[00:43:33] Yao also known as yao
[00:43:39] yao ya to the second power ya
[00:43:43] squared is our
[00:43:45] character

[01:00:06] faster
[01:00:08] duculan Shen Yun wait a second
[01:00:12] everyone's been playing this team with
[01:00:14] double Hydro right yeah yeah that's true
[01:00:18] okay actually no you no we've been using
[01:00:20] Bennett I forgot I
[01:00:23] forgot or double Hydro
[01:00:25] but what if your beted is busy what if
[01:00:29] retra buron was back in fashion cuz now
[01:00:34] we don't need a
[01:00:36] Healer what if retra buron was back in
[01:00:39] town ladies and
[01:00:41] gentlemen nice burning no no no but
[01:00:43] watch this we do fast
[01:00:45] Hydro now we can actually burgeon no
[01:00:49] even faster actually no we'll deal but
[01:00:52] okay if we have too much dendro we go we
[01:00:54] go
[01:00:56] BYU and then these are three characters
[01:00:59] from Le you can go [ __ ] lithic
[01:01:01] Claymore duuke as his best and Slot true
[01:01:04] true sing troll works too yes dud think
[01:01:08] about it think about
[01:01:10] it think about
[01:01:14] it but I don't I think Nita's probably
[01:01:17] the play uh it's just now you might proc
[01:01:22] burning no we need fre cuz we're not
[01:01:24] normal attacking we actually need finina
[01:01:26] here okay it might actually be wait let
[01:01:29] me cook it might actually be this
[01:01:33] team it might actually be this
[01:01:37] team uh maybe Nita is better then
[01:01:43] Vu
[01:01:49] um let me
[01:01:53] think
[01:01:55] if we space out our plunges and we don't
[01:01:57] press our
[01:02:04] skill cuz here's my here's my take chat
[01:02:07] I think using skill on deluke in a shanu
[01:02:09] team is such a waste of time it makes me
[01:02:11] want to skill myself off a bridge so I
[01:02:15] think we shouldn't go Crimson Witch of
[01:02:16] flames and we should go like Mari Shi or
[01:02:18] something uh Guild the dreams could work
[01:02:20] as well
[01:02:22] actually so maybe we'll do that
[01:02:24] I'll

[01:31:15] refined I refined the Jade instead of

[01:33:02] popular take or a not popular

[01:33:12] [ __ ] me if he's not boring as [ __ ] I'm
[01:33:15] sorry dude you
[01:33:17] literally like he's broken but like bro
[01:33:20] you literally just like wow
[01:33:23] yes woo oh one more
[01:33:27] woo like I I look I actually really like
[01:33:31] the character I think he's sick but like
[01:33:35] woohoo yeah
[01:33:38] woohoo let the mighty be
[01:33:42] humbled oh
[01:33:50] oops
[01:33:54] your saying is fun weeks ago no actually
[01:33:56] it's been like months that I've been
[01:33:57] calling him boring but the thing is when
[01:33:59] he like I like the character I think
[01:34:00] it's [ __ ] sick that he has a hydrop
[01:34:02] pump so like obviously I'm going to be
[01:34:03] excited to play a character with a
[01:34:04] hydrop pump But like after like a few
[01:34:06] weeks of playing him you're like well
[01:34:08] he's
[01:34:12] cool
[01:34:19] but dude
[01:34:22] dude no one who's played Shia before
[01:34:25] dude if you've played Shia you
[01:34:26] understand the depth of the character I
[01:34:28] get it Master space bar Mash your mouse
[01:34:30] button but if you do that you're you're
[01:34:32] not a good sh player there's death to it
[01:34:34] there's
[01:34:38] levels I also don't think nevet is
[01:34:40] boring I think net is different this
[01:34:42] could be biased but I don't know if it's
[01:34:44] biased because I also really like nalet
[01:34:45] like I like nalet a similar amount to
[01:34:48] alham like I think like even like
[01:34:50] storywise I think I think that was
[01:34:51] really cool I just I think I don't
[01:34:58] know I don't find never that
[01:35:09] boring
[01:35:11] okay em
[01:35:20] what
[01:35:35] do you think ging is the highest skill
[01:35:37] cap character uh well I think there's
[01:35:40] room for skill expression on him I don't
[01:35:42] know if he's the highest skill cap I've
[01:35:44] seen
[01:35:45] some I mean if you play [ __ ] Dragon
[01:35:47] strike without Shen Yun that might be
[01:35:49] higher uh the [ __ ] CLE players I
[01:35:52] don't know what the [ __ ] they're doing
[01:35:53] with their hands like okay that sounded
[01:35:55] like animation cats like it's [ __ ]
[01:35:56] hard on CLE I don't know if you've tried
[01:35:57] it the [ __ ] like normal [ __ ] is
[01:35:59] [ __ ] annoying okay that I promise
[01:36:01] that's not what I meant I that's
[01:36:04] actually not what I meant but uh [ __ ]
[01:36:06] okay now this is weird other characters
[01:36:08] that are difficult to play uh CLE
[01:36:11] animation counseling is I I learned it
[01:36:12] for a video when I was going to make a
[01:36:14] CLE guide but then I said [ __ ] it I'm
[01:36:15] not making a CLE ey but I learned how to
[01:36:17] do animation cancelling it was kind of
[01:36:18] difficult uh but you know gaming does
[01:36:21] have a lot of room for skill expression
[01:36:23] uh if I say Shia you're going to call me
[01:36:24] bias so I'm not going to mention him
[01:36:26] however he does there's a lot of
[01:36:27] different types of plunges there's ways
[01:36:28] to like float around go to different
[01:36:30] enemies you can charge attack you can
[01:36:32] normal cancel every jump most people
[01:36:34] miss a plunge when they normal plunge
[01:36:36] but you know the true Shia Mains don't
[01:36:38] anyways it is what it is
[01:36:41] um Etho cuz ushi Stacks yeah but you
[01:36:46] still Mash your thing Soo is
[01:36:50] um
[01:36:52] Soo getting your extra easen is kind of
[01:36:54] hard most of it you can just like you do
[01:36:56] it five times then you memorize it but
[01:36:58] depending on your like TF procs and
[01:37:00] stuff it is a bit like you get extra
[01:37:02] ease if you're good at Soo um he's not
[01:37:05] hard to play but you can like do better
[01:37:07] if you um like kind of know what you're
[01:37:13] doing like
[01:37:16] yeah
[01:37:20] um
[01:37:24] I don't know who else I mean Neo has
[01:37:26] like some complicated teams but it's not
[01:37:28] really like you just BL him
[01:37:32] everything guys parrying with
[01:37:36] bet child too yeah I mean child has a
[01:37:40] lot of stuff but I swear people
[01:37:41] overestimate how hard child is like I
[01:37:44] there's a lot of advanced mechanics sure
[01:37:45] but like okay once you learn to guas
[01:37:48] world it's like riding a bike like you
[01:37:49] learn it once and then you know it
[01:37:51] and it's like wow okay I do N2 [ __ ]
[01:37:54] charge attack or N3 charge attack okay
[01:37:58] cool but there's a lot there's a lot of
[01:38:00] advanced stuff if especially if you're
[01:38:02] like funneling particles to Shang Ling
[01:38:03] and [ __ ] but that's not like the
[01:38:04] character it's more the
[01:38:13] team
[01:38:15] yeah the team's not easy though like
[01:38:17] there's definitely skill expression in
[01:38:20] it
[01:38:24] um
[01:38:25] yeah I find it fun though I think
[01:38:27] Riptide is really cool um I mean youa
[01:38:31] you [ __ ]
[01:38:37] yeah yeah I don't
[01:38:42] know yeah definitely
[01:38:45] CLE okay in another sense similar to Cle
[01:38:49] well actually not really similar they're
[01:38:50] both catalysts who can like hold dou
[01:38:52] when they normal attack but um well it's
[01:38:55] different CLE is like you spam N1 ning
[01:38:56] Wong you can animation Castle I think uh
[01:38:58] cuz she has three different animations
[01:38:59] for [ __ ] normal attack but um ning
[01:39:03] Wong could be the hardest in the sense
[01:39:05] that every time you burst and your rocks
[01:39:07] aside to go nowhere and you do no damage
[01:39:09] uh it does cost around I'd say a few
[01:39:12] months of your life because of the
[01:39:14] stress that it causes you so ning Wong
[01:39:16] is definitely up there in terms of
[01:39:18] difficulty
[01:39:20] um
[01:39:21] but yeah I mean alam's like a little
[01:39:25] he's not hard but like he's like a
[01:39:27] little complicated not really but like
[01:39:30] if you want to like swap between his
[01:39:32] burst and the
[01:39:34] infusion kind of tight but after that
[01:39:37] you just Spam your like all you need to
[01:39:39] do is use something every 4 seconds
[01:39:41] that's it like it's not hard
[01:39:44] to
[01:39:49] yeah what
[01:39:54] than for the
[01:39:56] dollar what the [ __ ] is
[01:40:02] that said Al was too difficult I don't
[01:40:04] yeah I don't know he's not he's
[01:40:09] not has a wheel there's a two one
[01:40:12] appreciate
[01:40:19] it
[01:40:23] I guess Hut is a
[01:40:25] bit like there's a lot of room for
[01:40:27] optimization but it's just like one
[01:40:29] thing well I guess your bur timing too
[01:40:31] but yeah hello
[01:40:47] Z do I still have K resin I don't know
[01:40:51] let me
[01:40:53] check cool
[01:40:56] it I
[01:41:07] don't ah [ __ ] it one more you can't make
[01:41:10] fun of me I already explained why you
[01:41:12] can't get mad at me did I even do my
[01:41:14] daily commissions I don't think I did
[01:41:16] okay wait we're going to spend a resin
[01:41:17] but first let me let me get a couple
[01:41:19] chests in the new area cuz our
[01:41:20] commission points are at
[01:41:22] zero and I'm an exploration gamer okay

[02:29:28] fav all right chat here is the trick if
[02:29:31] you want to save money refining here's
[02:29:33] what you
[02:29:35] do see how this would
[02:29:39] cost 15,000 MOA 15,000 MOA if I refine
[02:29:43] five LS in one click but what you could
[02:29:45] do is let's I want to refine this five
[02:29:46] Lance I do one right boom that cost
[02:29:49] 1,000 okay so instead of 50,000 1,000
[02:29:51] then you go you take your you go to an
[02:29:53] R1 Lance you you you go on this one in
[02:29:56] hats then you refine the R1 to an R3 by
[02:29:59] throwing the R2 in it it costs
[02:30:07] 3K yeah wait did they Nerf it wait a
[02:30:10] second they patched it wow they [ __ ]
[02:30:12] patched it wait wait wait wait wait wa
[02:30:15] wait did they supposed to cost
[02:30:18] 1K no way they patched
[02:30:23] it what why' they patch
[02:30:32] it man [ __ ] this game they actually
[02:30:35] patched
[02:30:38] it that is so
[02:30:45] cringe
[02:30:49] damn that's so cringe what the
[02:30:55] [ __ ] oh good
[02:30:58] evening is it viable for me to play VAP
[02:31:01] Z
[02:31:04] with thanks yes it's probably actually
[02:31:07] it's definitely Shen's best team it's
[02:31:09] not even
[02:31:11] close any bad character's best team is
[02:31:15] Bennett C6 finina and shenyun provided
[02:31:18] they can get power infus by
[02:31:21] Bennett have fun
[02:31:24] this time to
[02:31:29] shine also provided you want to play the
[02:31:32] unit cuz you can hyper blo and then not
[02:31:33] use the unit but yeah are you doing Vape
[02:31:36] Barbara wait maybe I should actually
[02:31:38] dude my Barbara is insane I have a
[02:31:40] normal crowd yeah I do wait maybe we
[02:31:43] should do
[02:31:45] that
[02:31:57] CH did anyone notice the [ __ ] did
[02:31:59] anyone notice shu's normal attack
[02:32:14] animation what dude it moves on its own
[02:32:17] it okay uh okay let me gear my Barbara
[02:32:20] we're going to do Barbara
[02:32:23] Vape it's going to be fun I promise you
[02:32:26] this Barbara will deal more than you've
[02:32:28] ever seen okay that's a false promise
[02:32:30] but it will be high and it will be
[02:32:32] Mighty where's our
[02:32:36] [Music]
[02:32:40] Barbara to of Eternal flow B and
[02:32:45] slot
[02:32:49] [Music]
[02:32:52] actually this is charge attack damage
[02:32:54] wait maybe not never mind I forgot we're
[02:32:55] not charge attacking we're plunging okay
[02:32:57] never mind uh wi it is still really good
[02:33:00] if we get the good
[02:33:04] ones this is good too honestly we could
[02:33:07] just go lost
[02:33:10] prayer normal charge yeah maybe lost
[02:33:14] prayer I could try to just Wit It and
[02:33:16] get
[02:33:18] lucky everything's good on Wht yeah but
[02:33:20] like I need to make sure I time it
[02:33:21] correctly and attack is a lot worse with
[02:33:25] shenyun it's like way worse cuz you have
[02:33:27] a lot of attack from Bennett already and
[02:33:28] no bless and shenyun won't skill with
[02:33:30] that right I assume Whit will work with
[02:33:33] Shen yun's buff like the passive I
[02:33:37] assume so well yeah cuz it just Buffs
[02:33:40] your Barbara
[02:33:42] so yeah we can still do this I guess
[02:33:49] are you going Mar uh I was thinking of
[02:33:51] going the hydro set but M say is
[02:33:54] probably the
[02:33:56] best it's probably just the best yeah or
[02:33:59] reminescence dude reminescence gives you
[02:34:02] like 50 well obviously this isn't better
[02:34:04] than Mar but like substat wise it
[02:34:08] probably is way
[02:34:11] better you can't go either wait
[02:34:15] why what do you
[02:34:17] mean her e [ __ ] your Vapes dude no way
[02:34:21] it's that
[02:34:22] bad oh I guess we're not playing Kaza
[02:34:25] wait what's our team Bennett
[02:34:27] shenyun yeah we are playing
[02:34:29] Kaza
[02:34:32] wait unless we go like [ __ ] Shang
[02:34:35] langing we're playing Kaza

[02:34:40] we're going Shang okay
[02:34:43] fine all right Mari Shi it is
[02:34:48] marish shy it is I'm going to filter by
[02:34:50] crit

[02:34:56] Mar chat you're not ready for what
[02:34:58] you're about to
[02:35:02] see this is really
[02:35:08] nice okay I'm not joking if this gets 30
[02:35:12] crit damage 100 gifted you think I'm
[02:35:14] [ __ ] joking test me test
[02:35:17] me defense that's
[02:35:20] good what if they release a defense
[02:35:22] Skilling character in the
[02:35:24] future okay how drain HP
[02:35:31] forena
[02:35:35] rizzly oh wait this piece is
[02:35:37] better ah no it's not yeah no it's
[02:35:44] not
[02:35:47] yoink we need an em sand or a hydro
[02:35:49] goblet on set that is a hydro goblet
[02:35:54] uh we'll take
[02:36:04] it where
[02:36:06] finina oh I guess Bennett is [ __ ]
[02:36:09] useless wait what if we just bench
[02:36:11] Bennett no we can't bench Bennett dude
[02:36:13] why doesn't Bennett apply pyro why
[02:36:15] doesn't his burst pyro AA inside of it
[02:36:19] could you imagine how much how much
[02:36:20] cooler of a character he would be cuz
[02:36:22] then he would also [ __ ] up some
[02:36:23] reactions which means that in those
[02:36:25] teams you wouldn't want to run Bennett
[02:36:26] so he'd be like less less of like a p
[02:36:29] you know okay I guess we can't go my see
[02:36:33] D I just [ __ ] my rizzly for nothing
[02:36:40] unlucky dude all these sets [ __ ]

[02:36:55] stacks though right yeah we could still
[02:36:57] get three stacks normal charge plunge or
[02:37:01] normal I mean h i don't want a charge
[02:37:06] attack go for Crimson
[02:37:10] no

[02:37:16] I guess I get heart of
[02:37:18] nine where the [ __ ] is my heart of
[02:37:21] depth I could two piece but that would
[02:37:24] suck I could just use my skill and not
[02:37:26] be a little [ __ ] I feel like I should
[02:37:28] just use my
[02:37:30] skill wait I could just go gilded
[02:37:36] right
[02:37:38] yeah yeah we go
[02:37:42] gilded dude there's too many artifacts
[02:37:44] Us in this game now there's actually so
[02:37:47] many all right duuke sorry man this will
[02:37:51] hurt me more than it'll hurt
[02:38:00] you do I have a gilded Hydro goblet oh
[02:38:04] what the [ __ ] is
[02:38:06] this wait that's not fair that's

[02:38:24] want I want to say em but gilded
[02:38:28] plus Wht well whith could be either I

[02:38:47] we have 10 10 attack I actually [ __ ]
[02:38:49] can't okay we're
[02:39:06] not I mean I could also just go a high
[02:39:09] like I could go Skyward adlas too which
[02:39:12] I don't think is better but it makes us
[02:39:14] look better right like this looks better
[02:39:16] but [ __ ] attack weapons with shenyun

[02:49:35] true more damage than sh XD first of all
[02:49:37] it doesn't even so I would expect
[02:49:39] someone who's vaporizing to do more
[02:49:41] damage than Shia especially when it's a
[02:49:42] single Target pledge and Shia is Super E
[02:49:44] AOE however it's still less damage than
[02:49:46] my Shia even without constellation so
[02:49:48] that's still a wrong which is actually
[02:49:49] embarrassing for every character in the
[02:49:51] game that's not Shia because of how good
[02:49:52] of a DPS CH is with that said barbar

[02:59:09] unlucky
[02:59:12] unlucky
[02:59:42] h
[02:59:47] what are you doing I'm
[02:59:53] debating wait where is
[02:59:57] it
[03:00:12] uh
[03:00:14] okay chat I saw a
[03:00:21] video I saw a
[03:00:24] video chat I saw a
[03:00:28] video by
[03:00:34] Jamie that popped up in my
[03:00:37] recommended let me click on
[03:00:41] it called which character would I pull
[03:00:45] and I thought this was a funny idea uh
[03:00:49] now no disrespect but uh he said this
[03:00:52] for Shia he said Point
[03:00:55] like he said I like whatever tldr I'll
[03:00:58] paraphrase uh let me pause lerts I'll
[03:01:01] thank you though I appreciate it uh I'll
[03:01:02] paraphrase but he's like I like Shia he
[03:01:04] looks you know he's cool I like his
[03:01:05] design but you know Shia kind of needs a
[03:01:07] lot of characters I don't have fars on
[03:01:08] or he has like czo fars on you know I
[03:01:10] want all this stuff and and for that I
[03:01:12] actually commented I said I see like sha
[03:01:14] and his design uh but you don't have C6
[03:01:16] fars on a common problem uh boy have the
[03:01:18] solution for you imagine a team comp
[03:01:20] that works no matter the situation
[03:01:21] combining powerful elements such as
[03:01:23] Hydro dendro Electro and anemo a team
[03:01:26] comp not requiring a festar weapon
[03:01:27] insane artifacts or a C6 farizon a team
[03:01:29] comp you can run fonus and for Des
[03:01:31] inventor a team comp that works wonders
[03:01:33] in most rotations Shia hyper BL uh
[03:01:35] embrace it and you will know Glory
[03:01:36] looking forward to sh moving in the
[03:01:38] higher tier so I saw this unrelated to
[03:01:40] everything I saw this video and I was
[03:01:42] like oh I closed everything ha ha ha why
[03:01:45] is this open
[03:01:54] ha anyways I saw this video and I got
[03:01:59] inspired I saw this video I said you
[03:02:01] know
[03:02:02] what I'm not going to make a video I
[03:02:04] don't think but what if we what if we
[03:02:06] did something similar what characters if
[03:02:09] I was okay
[03:02:11] context as a as a nor normal genin
[03:02:14] impact player who would I pull for who
[03:02:17] would I pull
[03:02:19] for isn't that a good idea Bros stealing
[03:02:22] content [ __ ] that's all everyone
[03:02:25] does sorry sorry sorry it's not stealing
[03:02:28] it's hey that's a good idea let's do it
[03:02:30] too hey and I shouted them out that's a

[03:02:37] okay
[03:02:40] uh okay but I'm not putting any
[03:02:42] four-star characters in here cuz that's
[03:02:43] going to take [ __ ] 5 years and four
[03:02:45] star characters uh wait let me like put
[03:02:47] all the four stars at the
[03:02:49] bottom boom boom boom boom boom boom

[03:03:31] okay
[03:03:34] okay uh I need to add another
[03:03:40] tier make this gray uh let's make
[03:03:47] this okay here's what this would
[03:03:53] be we're gonna okay how would I do this
[03:03:56] this is going to be I love you this is
[03:03:58] going to
[03:04:01] be must pull no not must pull need then
[03:04:06] this is going to this going be love need
[03:04:10] want would
[03:04:12] consider
[03:04:14] probably not but
[03:04:17] maybe but probably not but
[03:04:20] maybe
[03:04:25] uh you know like a tier you know you get
[03:04:29] me and then uh
[03:04:33] no I'll just call this don't
[03:04:36] want okay actually I'll do another tier
[03:04:39] so there's going to be this is going to
[03:04:41] be no and then this one's going to be
[03:04:43] don't
[03:04:50] want move cam I mean it's fine right uh
[03:04:55] fine yeah I'm
[03:04:59] here okay this is five stars and this is
[03:05:01] me as a normie so fun fact before I
[03:05:04] started streaming the only character I
[03:05:06] skipped was CLE so um I'm
[03:05:11] sorry CLE no disrespect if you play
[03:05:15] CLE I'm going to put her in the don't
[03:05:17] want tier
[03:05:20] actually I'm starting things off by
[03:05:22] making people angry she's going in the
[03:05:24] no tier I don't particularly like
[03:05:26] playing characters that are toddlers And
[03:05:29] I don't really I don't know she just
[03:05:31] doesn't really like I'd rather play
[03:05:32] duuke I just think duuke is cooler I was
[03:05:34] a duuke man when I started I was like
[03:05:35] I'd rather have duuke than CLE that was
[03:05:37] my reasoning that's why I skipped her if
[03:05:39] you want to play CLE play CLE okay the
[03:05:41] only toddler character that I'm like you
[03:05:43] know what this character's fun is Nita
[03:05:45] but we'll get there later but that's
[03:05:47] mostly cuz the story uh and she's also
[03:05:49] turbo broken but um uh
[03:05:53] anyways uh
[03:05:55] yeah oh yeah by the way this won't be
[03:05:57] like meta okay this isn't going to be
[03:05:59] like a Metalist but it's going to be
[03:06:00] like a enjoyment like design and how
[03:06:03] much I enjoy playing them now a lot of
[03:06:04] the playing enjoyment people are like oh
[03:06:07] play for fun not meta and I agree
[03:06:09] however sometimes being able to actually
[03:06:11] clear content is fun so if there a
[03:06:13] character where I don't know let's say I
[03:06:15] my burst cancels when I jump it's a bit
[03:06:18] less fun but you know that character may
[03:06:20] still be very
[03:06:21] well designed right okay okay so for the
[03:06:25] standard the standard characters do I
[03:06:26] even rank the [ __ ] standard
[03:06:27] characters I
[03:06:29] mean I don't know how do you even rank a
[03:06:32] standard character like I like duuke but
[03:06:34] like I'm not going to pull for him
[03:06:36] because he's a standard
[03:06:38] character I me I guess I could just I
[03:06:41] just put it on
[03:06:47] preference make it a separate tier yeah
[03:06:50] but like okay but like I want to rank
[03:06:52] DEA like what if DEA was a limited
[03:06:54] character I could pretend they're
[03:06:56] limited okay I'll leave them for the end
[03:06:57] I'll leave them for the end okay
[03:06:59] venty
[03:07:00] uh okay okay okay here's the lore here's
[03:07:03] the venty lore venty in 1.0 I pulled for
[03:07:05] by accident by trying to get fishal but
[03:07:07] I was like oh he seems really broken and
[03:07:08] then I got him I was like okay he's
[03:07:10] broken so in it at the time I would P I
[03:07:13] would definitely pull venty but now I'm
[03:07:16] like okay like let's say I just started
[03:07:17] playing the game now venty I would
[03:07:19] probably probably not but he's also one
[03:07:23] of my favorite archons like I think I
[03:07:25] like his personality I think he's cool I
[03:07:27] love venty he also helps with garbage
[03:07:29] content like he with like floor 11 10 n
[03:07:32] Overworld but I probably wouldn't if I'm
[03:07:34] like let's say I'm like a casual player
[03:07:35] I probably wouldn't P venty but he's
[03:07:37] cool I like
[03:07:40] M would consider okay I would in like
[03:07:44] the old days like old sh teams could run
[03:07:46] venti like sucas would give you more
[03:07:48] energy but you could do like still sh
[03:07:49] venti and then like e in the air like
[03:07:51] you you could
[03:07:54] but well I'll put him here child I I
[03:07:58] would get child for sure I like child
[03:08:00] he's fun uh again though it's like in
[03:08:05] [ __ ]
[03:08:06] 4.6 what the [ __ ] in 4.4 it's like
[03:08:09] there's so many good hydros that like
[03:08:11] let's say I already have a bunch of
[03:08:12] hydros I probably would get him anymore
[03:08:14] but like stand alone I would want him I
[03:08:16] like child but like if if like um yeah I
[03:08:21] think he's fun I think he's fun um maybe
[03:08:24] would
[03:08:25] consider but I'll put him in one because
[03:08:27] I like child like he's one of the he's
[03:08:29] the first limited character I like
[03:08:31] actually wanted to pull for
[03:08:32] right okay Jong
[03:08:37] Lee I would actually get jly jly dude
[03:08:40] dude dude jly yeah I actually yeah dude
[03:08:43] dude here me out here me out Jal makes
[03:08:45] you worse at the game cuz you don't need
[03:08:47] to dodge anymore but he's really good in
[03:08:50] teams that I like like he's really good
[03:08:52] with the characters I like he's really
[03:08:53] good with Shia well especially before
[03:08:54] the current like Shia meta team he's
[03:08:56] really good with like Linny nevet Hut
[03:08:59] there's a lot of characters that can use
[03:09:00] J Le I don't think you need them though
[03:09:03] but I would probably okay I need to
[03:09:05] clarify these teams so it doesn't look
[03:09:06] like this is me calling him a musle
[03:09:10] uh I need
[03:09:14] I I'm just going to put the I I want I
[03:09:16] love does that make sense
[03:09:19] okay but I don't think I I want J Lee a
[03:09:22] tier above we'll put him here we'll put
[03:09:25] him here for
[03:09:26] now all right
[03:09:31] albo I mean
[03:09:34] look yeah look look look here's my take
[03:09:39] so Jeff said where would you put me look
[03:09:42] I said no five Stars this is us there
[03:09:44] you
[03:09:45] go uh okay for for for
[03:09:51] albo ear like in the early days like 1.2
[03:09:55] I really like geot teams but now it's
[03:09:57] like let's say I like Navia I would just
[03:09:59] want one other GE character and if
[03:10:01] anything I just use wrong Le and I
[03:10:02] wouldn't need to pull for another one
[03:10:03] and I think albo's like a decent unit
[03:10:05] but not like the best pull so I know I'm
[03:10:09] talking meta now I'm sorry but like even
[03:10:11] just like play yeah I don't know I'm not
[03:10:12] the biggest Gio fan I I yeah uh
[03:10:24] G okay ganu I think is cool as like a I
[03:10:29] actually like her as like a burst
[03:10:30] support uh at the time she was really
[03:10:33] broken uh but I hate Char shotting I'm
[03:10:35] not a big Char shot fan the only sort of
[03:10:37] exception is kind of Linny he is a Char
[03:10:39] shter but I feel like I could quick swap
[03:10:41] a bit more with him uh but I'm not a fan
[03:10:43] of char shotting so I would put her in
[03:10:44] the uh okay but G SS are very rampant so
[03:10:48] I'm gonna be like hey probably not and
[03:10:51] probably okay to be fair the ventti G
[03:10:54] team is fun like when it works it's fun
[03:10:57] cuz you like burst you like suck
[03:10:58] everything up you freeze everything if
[03:11:00] ventti works then G also works and if
[03:11:02] they both work then I would play them
[03:11:04] both outside of that no Shia yeah I
[03:11:07] don't need to talk about it um I will
[03:11:11] say even if there was no farzon or
[03:11:13] shenyun or finina or any of that I still
[03:11:16] like Shia even if he was terrible I
[03:11:18] would love him he's gotten a lot better
[03:11:20] with a lot of patches I'm not here to
[03:11:21] shill you Shia you don't need him but I
[03:11:24] need him I love him and
[03:11:28] also and also uh he has gotten a lot
[03:11:31] better there's like artifact sets now
[03:11:32] even M which is efficient to farm
[03:11:34] there's good weap there's so many
[03:11:35] weapons you can use technically a free
[03:11:37] to playay one but that's from an old ass
[03:11:38] event so you probably don't have it
[03:11:40] there's like shenyun there's finina
[03:11:41] there's Bennett there's farzon I love
[03:11:44] Shia I don't think he needs everything
[03:11:46] to be good but his his best team does
[03:11:49] want like a C6 fars on and some stuff
[03:11:51] that's a bit it doesn't matter I'm not
[03:11:53] talking about meta I'm talking about
[03:11:54] what I like I don't care [ __ ] you I like
[03:11:56] Shia uh Hut I actually really like Hut
[03:11:59] uh Hut is one of my favorite like yeah I
[03:12:01] like Hut I like Po arms in general Po's
[03:12:04] my favorite I like Hut uh she's fun
[03:12:06] she's good but I actually pulled for C1
[03:12:09] because I I played her a lot and I was
[03:12:11] like I don't want to jump cancel anymore
[03:12:13] so yeah I just like UT Kaza yep yep I
[03:12:17] love Kaza I love Kazo I'm sorry Kaza is
[03:12:20] great I'm sorry look I love sucros too
[03:12:23] but Kaz is great if I've said this
[03:12:25] before I'll say it again sometimes in
[03:12:27] life you might like feel down sometimes
[03:12:29] I have a bad day I have a bad week I'm
[03:12:31] like damn I don't really want to get out
[03:12:33] of bed
[03:12:34] today damn this [ __ ] sucks like you know
[03:12:37] stuff things can get hard but in those
[03:12:40] moments I
[03:12:41] remember wait a second some people play
[03:12:44] genin impact without Kaza and I have
[03:12:47] Kaza and that cheers me up so become a
[03:12:51] kazwa enjoyer
[03:12:54] now I love kazwa I'm sorry uh I'm sorry
[03:12:57] he he just he makes the game so dude
[03:13:00] it's so convenient to just group
[03:13:01] everything up like I love sucros don't
[03:13:04] get me wrong but she grouping with
[03:13:06] sucros is no comment I love sucros okay
[03:13:10] cos's there YULA is um I feel like YULA
[03:13:14] is
[03:13:26] like okay I'm gonna leave youa for later
[03:13:29] because uh of Ula players no
[03:13:34] disrespect actually no no no Ula players
[03:13:36] you guys are cool you guys will
[03:13:37] understand my reasoning okay let me be
[03:13:39] real with you okay visually let's say
[03:13:42] let's say G visually only I like YULA uh
[03:13:46] the fact that reverse is a big number
[03:13:48] that you can like screenshot means I
[03:13:51] probably would have impulse pulled her
[03:13:53] on her first Banner realistically I
[03:13:54] would have however I'm not a big fan of
[03:13:58] physical um I like her teams I think
[03:14:01] YULA Ryden B are all characters I
[03:14:04] love so I actually think I would
[03:14:07] consider her I just I feel like let's
[03:14:10] say it's like it's I'm really late to
[03:14:13] the game and it's like now I probably
[03:14:14] would get another DPS like I probably
[03:14:16] wouldn't actually pull for her but I
[03:14:18] like her enough to where I would enjoy
[03:14:19] her
[03:14:20] teams we'll put her
[03:14:22] there put her in consider AA I like
[03:14:27] AA
[03:14:29] um but I don't think I'm playing freeze
[03:14:31] I'm G be real I don't think casual Zio
[03:14:34] is playing
[03:14:37] freeze like I like AA she's one of my
[03:14:40] favorite cryo characters but like I I
[03:14:42] don't know if I would pull to play
[03:14:44] freeze um like she's
[03:14:48] cool and she's
[03:14:50] strong and I like that you can like
[03:14:52] [ __ ] Dash through water and [ __ ]
[03:14:56] but I guess would
[03:15:00] consider I
[03:15:02] mean
[03:15:11] I'll
[03:15:15] okay I'm going to do something but I
[03:15:17] don't want to talk about it I'm going to
[03:15:18] put veny here and AA here now I actually
[03:15:23] aaka is
[03:15:24] fun and freeze is great when it works
[03:15:27] but I don't think that casual zock would
[03:15:30] play a freeze team that's all there's
[03:15:32] nothing wrong with it I just don't think
[03:15:33] I would uh
[03:15:38] Yia uh look no disrespect that's all no
[03:15:42] dude dude she's cute she's cute Y is
[03:15:44] cute Y is cute Y is cute look at me chat
[03:15:46] Y is cute I just don't think I would uh
[03:15:49] get her like you know she's fun she's
[03:15:51] cool but I don't really
[03:15:54] like I don't know I don't know I I've
[03:15:57] never like look I get it maybe I just
[03:15:59] suck but I've never been like wow I'm
[03:16:02] having so much fun on Yi right now now
[03:16:04] you'll be like Z you play Shia sh is not
[03:16:07] fun look I we have different preferences
[03:16:09] that's okay I just y is like a eh you
[03:16:13] know I don't hate her but I'm not like a
[03:16:15] I need her you know Ryden y yeah for
[03:16:17] sure I I'll get her for sure dude dude
[03:16:20] she literally
[03:16:22] right yeah and I've said yeah yeah and
[03:16:26] enough
[03:16:28] said and I've said yeah and I've said uh
[03:16:33] it's great even casually you just get
[03:16:34] all your energy back just by
[03:16:36] whacking uh ton of damage you can also
[03:16:40] play her in hyper Bloom there's a lot
[03:16:41] there's a lot of teams you can run with
[03:16:43] her like a lot which is really cool
[03:16:47] um yeah no I like her I like Ryden and
[03:16:50] she just looks pretty like dude look at
[03:16:51] her dude literally look at Ryden like
[03:16:53] look at her exactly y too I like y as
[03:16:55] well uh would I put y as high I mean
[03:16:58] okay you know if a certain what did wait
[03:17:03] what did Z say Dono
[03:17:06] wall some people really love it but
[03:17:08] they're freaks wait what Yia Yia is like
[03:17:11] the strawberry milk of gin impact some
[03:17:13] people really love it but they're freaks
[03:17:14] okay no
[03:17:16] comment strawberrys good though
[03:17:19] what dude as a kid okay I got this like
[03:17:21] nesquick it was like a straw that was
[03:17:24] like a strawberry straw and you drank
[03:17:26] like regular milk with it and then the
[03:17:28] milk would go strawberry in your mouth
[03:17:30] is that weird it was actually pretty
[03:17:31] good it was actually pretty good it was
[03:17:34] actually pretty
[03:17:36] good dud no we have strawberry syrup in
[03:17:39] the
[03:17:41] chat dude they've been waiting their
[03:17:43] whole life for this
[03:17:47] moment okay I like y
[03:17:51] um I think she's really cool I like her
[03:17:53] alt animation I like her animations the
[03:17:55] only thing I don't like with her is
[03:17:57] being on like I like on Fielding y but I
[03:18:00] don't like her in a team where she's
[03:18:01] like kind of justce support because I
[03:18:03] feel like I have to press e a million
[03:18:04] times and it's annoying but I like her
[03:18:07] uh her gameplay is Hit or Miss for me so
[03:18:10] I'll put her in I want I think
[03:18:13] I don't like need her though a lot of
[03:18:14] teams I just run like another Electro
[03:18:16] but I like her kakomi I would definitely
[03:18:18] pull for for sure I love Ki
[03:18:23] um damn there's so many characters I
[03:18:25] love maybe I should put right in here no
[03:18:28] but is it bad for me to love this many
[03:18:30] characters I love the characters man
[03:18:33] it's part of it's like the only reason I
[03:18:34] still no not the only reason but you
[03:18:36] know one of the main reasons I play I
[03:18:38] love the characters EO eo's cool um
[03:18:41] again when I first saw him I was like
[03:18:43] damn I loveo but I'm not the biggest fan
[03:18:46] of a lot of Geo teams um so I would put
[03:18:49] him in a I would
[03:18:50] consider cuz he's cool but he is Gio but
[03:18:53] I wouldn't actually I don't think I
[03:18:55] would pull maybe AA is underrated I'll
[03:18:57] put him next
[03:19:01] AA ushi's Cool his teams are
[03:19:06] like they're very goe like you want like
[03:19:09] Goro and then another one yeah
[03:19:14] yeah yeah okay Shena um Shena I actually
[03:19:19] think is really
[03:19:21] cool
[03:19:24] uh she is arguably distracting to play
[03:19:27] where is shha I like Shena I do I have
[03:19:30] her skin I actually like Shena the only
[03:19:32] thing is would I play a crow oh my God
[03:19:34] she's on a level 25 oh my God the only
[03:19:37] thing is would I play a crry team
[03:19:39] honestly I feel like there's a good
[03:19:41] chance I pull rizzly and if I pull rizy
[03:19:42] then I would want to pull Shena so I
[03:19:44] think I would want to have her on my
[03:19:45] account to buff uh uh any crowd team I
[03:19:49] play but I don't think I would pull for
[03:19:51] her unless I have other crowd characters
[03:19:52] so like let's say I pulled for AA or
[03:19:54] like rizzly or whatever then I would get
[03:19:55] Shena if I didn't I would skip her
[03:19:57] that's probably what I do I'll put it I
[03:19:58] want uh
[03:20:00] Ayo oh no
[03:20:02] Ayo look at what they did to my
[03:20:06] boy I was a big advocate for
[03:20:09] AO I think he's cool you can use them in
[03:20:12] so many teams and then they release nlet
[03:20:15] who you know uh now this isn't a
[03:20:21] medalist io's very
[03:20:24] flexible he's actually uh do I find him
[03:20:27] fun I mean you just press your e and
[03:20:29] they're
[03:20:31] like I like them I find certain teams
[03:20:35] fun which is why I'm talking about like
[03:20:36] team flexibility I think okay part of a
[03:20:38] thing that would make me like a
[03:20:39] character is also if they can be ran in
[03:20:41] a lot of teams and if those teams are
[03:20:42] fun and I think IO does have a lot of
[03:20:44] fun teams so I would definitely at least
[03:20:46] consider him um yeah I would consider
[03:20:49] him he's not like my favorite like like
[03:20:52] design wise I I'm more appealed by
[03:20:55] someone like you know alham or like
[03:20:57] nevet um even someone that's like wor
[03:20:59] like even Soo like I think visually
[03:21:01] soo's stunning why am I talking like
[03:21:03] that what the [ __ ] am I doing yeah I
[03:21:05] don't know uh but yeah we'll consider
[03:21:07] Soo I love look I didn't bch him I know
[03:21:12] I can't always play Soo okay I can't
[03:21:15] always play
[03:21:17] Soo I can't the Anubis design the like
[03:21:21] Egypt like God mythology religion
[03:21:24] something like the lore the the the
[03:21:26] Anubis thing very cool I think that's
[03:21:29] sick I've I've always been liked stuff
[03:21:32] like that okay I think it's very
[03:21:34] cool
[03:21:36] uh and I remember in like genin's first
[03:21:39] or second trailer like the super old
[03:21:41] trailer with Soo I was like I want to
[03:21:43] [ __ ] get that guy I want to M that
[03:21:45] guy and then I saw Shia but still I was
[03:21:46] like I want that guy I love Soo uh
[03:21:48] gameplay wise the only thing I find
[03:21:51] cringe is that I can't swap out for a
[03:21:52] really long time now that's also the
[03:21:54] case with like Shia and even alyam but
[03:21:56] what's different with sh sh in
[03:21:58] particular is like swapping feels really
[03:21:59] shitty and you also kind of want to Mark
[03:22:02] enemies with like Nita sometimes or
[03:22:03] there's like multi-wave content and it's
[03:22:05] a little Annoying whereas with Shia you
[03:22:07] can kind of just jump to them and plunge
[03:22:09] uh but that's kind of skill like you
[03:22:12] don't need to run to hos Soo I like Soo
[03:22:14] I don't know I feel like I don't play
[03:22:16] him as much as I would want to because
[03:22:18] there's so many DPS characters that I
[03:22:19] like but I definitely would pull Soo no
[03:22:20] matter like I definitely would I can't
[03:22:22] see myself not pulling
[03:22:24] Soo uh yeah like I feel like there's not
[03:22:28] enough characters that I need though but
[03:22:29] I don't think Soo is a yeah
[03:22:33] Dam okay yolan oh I love Yan [ __ ] I
[03:22:37] can't put it I'll put her in I need I'll
[03:22:38] put her in I need I can't dude I can't
[03:22:40] have the whole tier list be here I
[03:22:42] definitely would pull for Yan actually
[03:22:44] yeah yeah yeah yeah no no dude okay this
[03:22:46] is like Zio lore this is like really old
[03:22:49] Z lore in like October 2020
[03:22:54] right this like game just came out right
[03:22:58] this is back when calling Shang Ling
[03:23:00] better than duuke was like a a bad take
[03:23:03] okay people were starting to find out
[03:23:05] Singo was good broken so Jeff was like
[03:23:07] dude Singo is better than your five
[03:23:09] stars and I and he was you know a bit
[03:23:12] later than that he was in like every
[03:23:13] duuke team and I was like you know what
[03:23:15] I just want to play duuke Kaaya I don't
[03:23:17] want to have to put SRO in every
[03:23:21] team however yolon is another
[03:23:24] zingro and I like yon she has a dice she
[03:23:28] is
[03:23:30] yolan and she's good and she's fun and
[03:23:32] you can explore with her the E honestly
[03:23:35] even her C1 helps with that I like Gan
[03:23:38] so I definitely would get her even just
[03:23:40] as a second s show or replacement or an
[03:23:43] addition uh
[03:23:45] Neu I want NE I think I would get her uh
[03:23:49] cuz you could use like kakomi aita
[03:23:51] they're fun characters blo team are cool
[03:23:54] uh I would get Neu if I so I feel like
[03:23:57] my account wouldn't start with nuu so I
[03:24:00] would have already DPSS so I would never
[03:24:01] need her but if I want another play
[03:24:04] style like if I want to be able to play
[03:24:05] Bloom I would get nuu I like her um I
[03:24:08] put her in I want yeah that's fair Nita
[03:24:11] yeah we're getting Nita I'll put her in
[03:24:14] need um cuz I could see myself not
[03:24:17] caring like I'm not going to lie when I
[03:24:20] saw that dend archon was like a toddler
[03:24:22] I was like you know what I kind of don't
[03:24:23] want her that was my take dude I wanted
[03:24:25] the dend Aron to be like some shape
[03:24:27] shifting Beast I wanted [ __ ]
[03:24:30] uder one second I've talked about this
[03:24:32] before I wanted this [ __ ] give
[03:24:35] me that that's the dender archon boom he
[03:24:36] turns into a bear but I was like you
[03:24:39] know what I play I did theore the story
[03:24:42] that by the way is why we're never
[03:24:44] getting a skip button because you play
[03:24:45] the story and then you like the
[03:24:45] character and then you P for the
[03:24:46] character so I actually like Nita now um
[03:24:49] good archon and very fun to play you
[03:24:52] just Mark everything they're all marked
[03:24:53] you don't have to think about it again
[03:24:54] your alt is sick and she's really strong
[03:24:58] so I like I
[03:24:59] like um so I'll put her
[03:25:02] here uh
[03:25:06] Scara I would definitely get Scara he
[03:25:09] has Faron on his Banner scar scar at
[03:25:11] least I want uh I think because of how
[03:25:14] good okay unironically this is no cap
[03:25:18] zero cap right now because of how fun
[03:25:21] exploring is with like because of how
[03:25:22] good he is for exploring he would
[03:25:24] probably go here but like gameplay-wise
[03:25:27] okay exploring he's here gameplay wise
[03:25:29] he's here so he's probably in the middle
[03:25:31] the only thing I don't like about
[03:25:32] playing Scara is if I don't have a
[03:25:34] shield because then I just get knocked
[03:25:35] everywhere
[03:25:37] um
[03:25:40] but yeah
[03:25:45] I also like fatou in general um so I
[03:25:48] think they're
[03:25:49] here things than I want Aly them yep we
[03:25:54] love Al Hey them do I need to say more
[03:25:56] his
[03:25:57] gameplay very strong fun look at him uh
[03:26:01] very cool character I like him de I like
[03:26:05] D I actually love de H so de's a
[03:26:08] standard wait we're gonna do standard
[03:26:09] Banner characters we'll talk about
[03:26:10] standard at the end
[03:26:11] genuinely though like I really like de
[03:26:14] but she's a Santa Banner character so
[03:26:15] obviously I wouldn't pull but okay
[03:26:20] BYU okay here's my baiju take first
[03:26:23] baiju banner I definitely would not have
[03:26:25] pulled but after finina came out I
[03:26:27] probably would does that make sense like
[03:26:29] I like baiju finina teams but on his own
[03:26:32] I would just use yao
[03:26:33] yao cuz I like ya Yao I like yugu um
[03:26:38] with finina I I would I think I would
[03:26:40] put him in Ian like I would consider it
[03:26:43] so
[03:26:47] yeah yeah you get both Soo and Aly them
[03:26:50] yeah like if you're making like in terms
[03:26:52] of like okay trying to build my account
[03:26:54] for meta I'd only pull for like two DPSS
[03:26:56] but realistically I'd pull for the
[03:26:57] characters I want right this is about
[03:26:58] like a how much do I want the character
[03:27:01] like on my
[03:27:04] account all right
[03:27:07] nlet I definitely would pull for nlet
[03:27:11] yeah yeah I've got it a little bored of
[03:27:13] the hydrop pump but it's still a giant
[03:27:16] ass Hydro beam so I'm biased to thinking
[03:27:19] it's cool he floats around he's super
[03:27:21] broken and I like his character uh I
[03:27:25] have I'm being honest I have gotten a
[03:27:26] little bored but again every time I call
[03:27:28] a character fun or not fun oh oh Rich
[03:27:31] coming from you you play Pogo Stick I'm
[03:27:33] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry but I do play
[03:27:36] him a lot like I play him a lot so maybe
[03:27:37] that's why I'll put him here uh well
[03:27:40] yeah I'll put
[03:27:51] yeah I'll put him
[03:27:52] here he's your Discord profile picture
[03:27:55] okay he literally is actually okay yeah
[03:27:57] I forgot
[03:27:59] cuz yeah I think I've literally just
[03:28:02] been using him so much that I forgot
[03:28:04] that I really liked them like I'm like
[03:28:07] oversaturated I do really like him okay
[03:28:09] caught hey I got caught you got me true
[03:28:11] he's an I need for sure he's an I need
[03:28:13] for sure I do really like him he also is
[03:28:16] Levy's VA that is
[03:28:20] true okay maybe he's here but I'm going
[03:28:23] to leave him in I need for
[03:28:27] now why is I need under I love I don't
[03:28:30] know dude this is It's it doesn't it's
[03:28:33] just bro said Levy okay Levi [ __ ] you
[03:28:37] shut up I I care more that he's psyche
[03:28:39] I'm sorry I've been watching Gotham
[03:28:42] chess my bad okay
[03:28:46] Linny it's showtime Linn's cool I'd
[03:28:49] consider Linny again not a big fan of B
[03:28:51] like Char CHS linny's like giant cat in
[03:28:55] a hat is cool
[03:28:57] um and he's cool in the story and stuff
[03:29:00] so I would actually consider but I'm not
[03:29:01] a big fan of Charter so there's a decent
[03:29:04] chance I also don't get
[03:29:06] him RI theli rizle is
[03:29:14] no no no no okay rizle looks cool I
[03:29:18] think okay okay okay genuine
[03:29:21] take genuine
[03:29:25] take when I saw nevet and rizley I was
[03:29:29] like damn these are
[03:29:32] cool visually I kind of like Grizzly a
[03:29:35] bit more then I was like oh [ __ ] nevet
[03:29:38] is not going to spoil the quest although
[03:29:40] it's very obvious at the start but I'm
[03:29:42] still not going to spoil the quest okay
[03:29:43] I kind of like nevet but rizzly is cool
[03:29:47] so I
[03:29:48] actually I want to be honest the only
[03:29:51] thing I don't like about rizzly is that
[03:29:53] I have
[03:30:02] to I kind of don't like punching enemies
[03:30:05] without C1 that is just that's just like
[03:30:07] bias from gameplay though it's not even
[03:30:10] about the damage he deals it's just like
[03:30:11] I don't know it feels annoying to like
[03:30:13] not like charge attack spam and like or
[03:30:16] not be able to charge attack all the
[03:30:17] time and stuff like that uh but I guess
[03:30:19] you want makes him more fun so I'd put
[03:30:21] him in
[03:30:22] the I don't know like I want
[03:30:28] him but I don't know if I would actually
[03:30:30] get him because there's a lot of DPSS on
[03:30:32] this
[03:30:36] list he's still a want I think he's
[03:30:38] still a want fra I love we love we're
[03:30:41] getting finina don't talk to me if you
[03:30:42] don't get finina I'm not don't don't
[03:30:44] feel you don't have to get her but don't
[03:30:45] talk to me if you don't get finina I'm
[03:30:47] sorry we're finina lovers in this
[03:30:48] household uh everything about her is
[03:30:50] cool she enables a bunch of teams which
[03:30:51] means I want to play those teams she's
[03:30:53] very like [ __ ] fun she's strong she's
[03:30:56] cool I love her lore I love finina don't
[03:30:59] talk to me if you don't love finina
[03:31:01] Navia
[03:31:04] uh okay I'mma Be 700% Real when I see
[03:31:09] Navia and corent I'm like holy [ __ ] I
[03:31:12] need choren so if choren comes out
[03:31:14] choren is here Navia is cool
[03:31:18] um but I don't think I go crazy over
[03:31:20] Navia like she's good she's really fun
[03:31:23] nuking on your skill is kind of what I
[03:31:25] wanted from Ula no disrespect to YULA
[03:31:27] but like it's the same satisfaction as
[03:31:29] like a big burst but you get it without
[03:31:31] having to reset if it doesn't crit and
[03:31:33] if it misses an enemy it's like a 8C
[03:31:35] cool down or whatever it is six instead
[03:31:37] of I think it's six right cuz oh my God
[03:31:41] H sorry that was disrespectful
[03:31:44] uh SE nine what the why did I think it
[03:31:47] was six oh yeah cuz 27 wait yeah yeah
[03:31:49] yeah 1827 yeah okay anyways doesn't
[03:31:51] matter um I would consider I think she's
[03:31:54] like next like I like her more than I
[03:31:56] like youa but I don't like her more than
[03:31:58] I
[03:32:05] like yeah she's in a wood consider I
[03:32:07] don't think she's higher she's cool
[03:32:09] though but
[03:32:17] yeah then this is front loaded why do I
[03:32:20] like so many characters damn no way
[03:32:22] yia's okay I feel bad for Yia I can't
[03:32:25] all right
[03:32:30] yo I'm sorry y
[03:32:37] up actually toxic
[03:32:39] man
[03:32:48] all right anyways uh Shen Yun I love
[03:32:53] shenyun man but I don't
[03:32:56] think okay me loving shenyun part of it
[03:32:59] is because I love Shia and they can be
[03:33:01] played together but even outside of that
[03:33:05] there's like many reasons I like her
[03:33:06] first of all she enables brand new play
[03:33:08] styles for characters that I like like
[03:33:10] huta and duuke she makes duuke a lot
[03:33:12] better well at least a whole new team
[03:33:14] where duuke is actually really good
[03:33:15] there's a you could plunge with like
[03:33:18] anyone not meta l w okay but having a
[03:33:21] bunch of play Styles and making teams
[03:33:24] dude okay being a good character a lot
[03:33:26] of times translates to to like more
[03:33:29] enjoyable gameplay but even if she was
[03:33:30] dog [ __ ] being able to like make a team
[03:33:33] that otherwise wouldn't exist is cool
[03:33:35] that's like a upside that's actually why
[03:33:37] I like Neu but Bloom's good but like I
[03:33:39] like Neu because she gives you new teams
[03:33:41] I like Shen Yun cuz she lets my duuke do
[03:33:44] stuff she lets Shia do stuff she's like
[03:33:47] you can explore with her which is pretty
[03:33:49] cool she also [ __ ] looks like this
[03:33:52] where is she where is she where is she
[03:33:54] she looks like
[03:33:55] this and I find her very
[03:33:59] enjoyable
[03:34:01] um yeah I actually think I would get her
[03:34:04] mostly because of Shia would also like
[03:34:05] duuke and stuff like I think the teams
[03:34:08] that she's in are fun that's part of the
[03:34:10] part this list also is how much
[03:34:11] enjoyment I get from playing the
[03:34:13] character in their teams right like the
[03:34:15] teams
[03:34:17] matter cuz like I'm not going to pull
[03:34:19] for a character just to look at them and
[03:34:20] never play them right like yeah you can
[03:34:23] be like okay well I'll pull for a
[03:34:23] character to explore which like I like
[03:34:26] like you know scarth explor and [ __ ] but
[03:34:27] it's like a lot of times if I pull for a
[03:34:29] character I want the team that I'm going
[03:34:30] to use them in to be fun
[03:34:32] or yeah so I like shenu
[03:34:39] um
[03:34:44] maybe here
[03:34:58] though damn are those all the five
[03:35:05] stars all right chori before seeing
[03:35:08] anything about her kit she's not out
[03:35:10] right now I don't look at leaks it's 4.4
[03:35:13] right now she is not out we don't
[03:35:16] know uh she kind of has an attitude
[03:35:19] she's like I don't really care about you
[03:35:21] I think that's cool we'll put her in I
[03:35:23] want well okay this is bias though cuz
[03:35:25] she's not out so obviously I want
[03:35:28] her realistically chori and Navi are
[03:35:31] probably similar because they're both
[03:35:32] Gio I think if I were to pick one I
[03:35:34] think Shori is more like I think Navia
[03:35:37] is more wholesome and Shori is more cool
[03:35:38] so I would put Shori here but I don't
[03:35:40] know what her game play is so we're
[03:35:41] going put it
[03:35:43] back we don't know maybe she's not fun
[03:35:46] maybe she is I actually don't know you
[03:35:47] guys are typing Kappa I actually don't
[03:35:48] know I actually don't know I actually
[03:35:50] don't
[03:35:54] know okay what do we think about this
[03:35:56] list well actually it's my opinion so I
[03:35:58] don't care about your opinion true freak
[03:35:59] you
[03:36:01] chat would I change
[03:36:04] anything
[03:36:09] um
[03:36:15] okay venti's probably here I I don't
[03:36:17] think
[03:36:20] I'm I
[03:36:22] mean like I guess I would consider
[03:36:25] aaka no I don't think I I mean I like
[03:36:29] her it's probably this no but then this
[03:36:32] makes Etho look bad and then this
[03:36:39] makes
[03:36:41] I'm
[03:37:09] overthinking
[03:37:27] yeah yeah probably
[03:37:31] this but I don't know what if I make a
[03:37:34] new tier add row below I call this jail
[03:37:38] and then I make
[03:37:39] it almost unreadable and I put you on me
[03:37:42] in
[03:37:42] jail
[03:37:44] sorry do four stars well four stars are
[03:37:47] different because it's also like yeah
[03:37:50] for are different I feel
[03:38:03] like why is Cle the only no cuz I can't
[03:38:06] see myself ever pulling for Cle like
[03:38:08] unironically I actually can't see myself
[03:38:10] pulling for C like I I actually prefer
[03:38:12] Yen so like why would I go for Cle if I
[03:38:15] have Yen right like I don't
[03:38:25] know like I could see myself on a
[03:38:28] drunken night be like you know what
[03:38:30] [ __ ] man I'm getting albo [ __ ] man
[03:38:32] I'm getting Yia but I would never be
[03:38:33] like [ __ ] M I'm getting CLE I would
[03:38:34] be like okay I got to go to bed that's
[03:38:36] that would be my limit I'd be like I'm
[03:38:37] going to
[03:38:39] bed
[03:38:41] she's adorable yeah but I don't really
[03:38:43] play Char okay this might be why Yia is
[03:38:46] all Sol low I don't really care about
[03:38:47] characters that are like I wanted to say
[03:38:50] cute but also like I feel like finina is
[03:38:52] cute I don't know I I I don't really
[03:38:55] that's not really my
[03:38:57] like unless their gamep play is really
[03:39:05] fun metab bias well like honestly if CLE
[03:39:10] if to me c was really fun then yeah I
[03:39:12] would rank I would probably like her
[03:39:15] more like I can't lie if Nita's gameplay
[03:39:18] was like okay let's say Nikita was
[03:39:20] literally like dendro MC like all Nita
[03:39:23] did was exactly dendro MC I would be
[03:39:25] like okay why would I pull for a toddler
[03:39:27] so like I'm not just ranking their
[03:39:29] design right it's also like how much
[03:39:31] enjoyment do I get from them and how
[03:39:33] much do I enjoy their teams and what do
[03:39:34] they provide to my account so there is
[03:39:36] some bias towards what they actually do
[03:39:38] that definitely matters
[03:39:51] you don't like animation cing to get
[03:39:52] acceptable
[03:39:54] damage all right whatever this is my
[03:39:59] opinion um okay I'm allowed to okay okay
[03:40:03] who's the I'm allowed to rank one
[03:40:09] fourar
[03:40:13] yeah we put her right above the
[03:40:16] eye okay sorry sorry
[03:40:21] sorry I'm sorry I'm
[03:40:26] sorry oh [ __ ] the day
[03:40:28] reset wait Chad do you think I got an
[03:40:31] achievement uh I mean a commission that

[03:42:41] rail you mean star rail is weird unless
[03:42:43] you mean actually like hongye but star
[03:42:45] is weird because I like there's
[03:42:47] characters that I really really like and
[03:42:49] then there's characters that are kind of
[03:42:50] just I don't
[03:42:52] care a lot more it's more polarizing for
[03:42:54] me than genin I feel
[03:42:57] like

[03:43:19] mean a starl
[03:43:23] one okay I'm speedr running this though
[03:43:25] I don't want to talk about it I actually
[03:43:26] don't want to
[03:43:28] talk need
[03:43:31] want
[03:43:33] maybe don't
[03:43:36] want or eh don't want
[03:43:43] okay uh who's even a five star okay wait
[03:43:47] is this a range by four stars oh it's in
[03:43:48] order it's in reverse order
[03:43:50] okay um should I put the standard
[03:43:53] characters here too I'll put the
[03:43:55] standard characters here too I don't
[03:44:01] care I mean col is actually pretty
[03:44:05] good I don't care about jard anymore I
[03:44:07] wanted jard and then F run came out and
[03:44:09] now I don't care
[03:44:10] I mean I guess
[03:44:18] eh Scythe
[03:44:22] cool
[03:44:28] mean
[03:44:31] benched okay okay let me remove the SS
[03:44:34] let me R the SS we're going to keep BR
[03:44:35] cuz she's not really a s character she's
[03:44:37] broken okay everone agree everone agree
[03:44:39] okay okay okay okay I like cely side
[03:44:41] character very cool very cool very cool
[03:44:42] I would wand
[03:44:46] um jingu uh maybe
[03:44:51] maybe okay I probably skip him but he's
[03:44:54] cool I think he's cool um I think he's
[03:44:57] cool uh silver wolf I like I like silver
[03:45:01] wolf time for a
[03:45:04] bug I will get her Lua is my goat he is
[03:45:08] my lifesaver I love
[03:45:10] lra I do love there's no way I skip lra
[03:45:15] it was designed by my
[03:45:19] mother uh blade yep need Kafka need look
[03:45:23] at her also look at blade uh speaking of
[03:45:26] which Black Swan look at her right next
[03:45:27] to Kafka yep uh let's go in order uh
[03:45:32] Fen I definitely would get her F I feel
[03:45:36] like okay all the healers to me are just
[03:45:37] like want I don't know if there's any
[03:45:39] that I would pull more than the others I
[03:45:40] know Fan's broken but I actually think I
[03:45:42] like lra more so I probably would put
[03:45:44] lra
[03:45:46] there um but I realistically I'd pull
[03:45:48] for both
[03:45:50] honestly but I'd put these two
[03:45:54] there
[03:45:57] maybe uh who's next imator yep we're
[03:46:00] getting emor jinglu yep we're getting
[03:46:02] jinglu
[03:46:04] topaz
[03:46:06] maybe actually I do like topaz num is
[03:46:08] sick and I like exploring with her so
[03:46:10] yeah topaz is there uh Argent is dude no
[03:46:19] way don't take this list as seriously as
[03:46:22] the getra one the getra one's base this
[03:46:23] one I'm just like ooh sexy character or
[03:46:26] oo I don't
[03:46:28] care D no way I like every character I
[03:46:31] got to
[03:46:33] chill hey BR go back
[03:46:38] down
[03:46:55] fine RG like rgd also is like beautiful
[03:46:58] but I don't know if I would get an
[03:46:59] audition
[03:47:01] character like audition is great
[03:47:03] actually I'd probably pull him just for
[03:47:04] pure fiction but like that's a meta
[03:47:08] take
[03:47:21] I mean ratio is free
[03:47:28] right R is a
[03:47:34] want runme would be a need if you I
[03:47:37] don't
[03:47:38] know if I'm factoring in like how broken
[03:47:41] she is she's I'm pulling for sure I
[03:47:44] don't even know what I'm ranking anymore
[03:47:45] I actually don't
[03:47:49] know but if I if I'm talking about like
[03:47:52] gameplay on account she goes
[03:47:55] here I guess Argent is
[03:47:58] there D there's too many characters I
[03:48:00] like I feel I actually don't like this
[03:48:01] list any at all cuz I don't like it when
[03:48:03] I just like put every character as like
[03:48:04] I like there needs to be a character I
[03:48:06] don't like but all the five stars are
[03:48:08] cool
[03:48:11] guess there's not enough characters
[03:48:13] yet definitely need Sparkle too by the
[03:48:20] way
[03:48:32] yeah two hottest man at the
[03:48:34] bottom okay well ratio you get for free
[03:48:37] like ratio is literally free
[03:48:49] so what yeah I don't know why he's on
[03:48:50] the
[03:48:51] list dude no way J you
[03:49:00] went dude I don't want to talk about
[03:49:02] this one okay that one it doesn't count
[03:49:03] the gcha one was fine that what we
[03:49:05] talking about how it sh like a
[03:49:08] heart
[03:49:24] why the [ __ ] is want everything but no
[03:49:25] jingu I don't know dude I'm just salty I
[03:49:27] don't have a good set on him so I never
[03:49:29] get to play
[03:49:32] him okay realistically the DPSS I would
[03:49:36] actually pull forward star rail are
[03:49:38] blade jingly and then a Kafka team like
[03:49:41] Kafka Black Swan but also like I like
[03:49:43] emit a lot so I'd probably get him but I
[03:49:45] probably wouldn't I would probably
[03:49:47] [ __ ] but you dude you need a lot of
[03:49:49] DPS in that game so like you don't only
[03:49:50] need like you don't only want two you
[03:49:52] like [ __ ]
[03:50:05] 10 so easy to make J work yeah but like
[03:50:07] I don't want to
[03:50:10] like why would I I don't know I don't he
[03:50:12] doesn't I don't
[03:50:14] know I have Argent like they do the same
[03:50:17] [ __ ] [ __ ] except one is like oh
[03:50:19] follow attack woo that's
[03:50:38] it
[03:50:46] this got one from every element yeah but
[03:50:48] I have Kafka you get me so usually
[03:50:50] something lightning weak I'll just
[03:51:01] CFA I don't hate him though I don't just
[03:51:05] like
[03:51:06] him I just don't know if I pull for him
[03:51:09] like I feel like he's the only five star
[03:51:11] I've pulled for and actively benched but
[03:51:13] I think I only benched him because I had
[03:51:15] [ __ ] relics and a [ __ ] like well the
[03:51:17] likeo is actually not bad but whatever
[03:51:19] it made my ratio look [ __ ] I think
[03:51:20] that's the only reason why so it's not
[03:51:22] like a personal thing against them okay
[03:51:24] no disrespect to jingu we're in the
[03:51:26] process of building him that's all not
[03:51:28] benched process of building okay
[03:51:36] okay why am I here
[03:51:40] not benched it's a
[03:51:43] process not bad for J think was six
[03:51:45] months sorry alerts are muted appreciate
[03:51:47] it
[03:51:51] though not bench chat it's a slow and
[03:51:54] Insidious
[03:52:07] process there's not follow you through
[03:52:09] TP yeah it does it's just like dudes on
[03:52:12] cannons that follow a you everywhere
[03:52:13] that's what R burst
[03:52:15] is the magic is
[03:52:20] month Aus 9 months hey there coming at
[03:52:26] you drop your
[03:52:37] weapons bro

[03:53:29] content
[03:53:31] [Music]
[03:53:33] creator things seem to be calming down
[03:53:36] but
[03:53:37] unfortunately once PVP is
[03:53:40] enabled it is hard to disable
[03:53:43] it meines are beautiful creatures and we
[03:53:46] try our best they are the pride of to
[03:53:48] not engage in player versus player
[03:53:51] action cause them no harm we stay
[03:53:53] outside of PVP we don't want to fight
[03:53:57] amongst ourselves when we can all love
[03:53:59] each other when we can all hold hands
[03:54:01] and laugh instead
[03:54:04] of brawling to the
[03:54:07] death and so today we will beat the
[03:54:10] allegations we will stay away from
[03:54:14] any any potential C getting caught in
[03:54:17] the crossfire any potential Strays
[03:54:20] coming to us we will stay away from
[03:54:22] it so ladies and
