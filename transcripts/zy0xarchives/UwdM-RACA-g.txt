[00:07:28] it just on my end
[00:07:30] foreign
[00:08:04] okay a few things but first of all
[00:08:07] I woke up this morning I woke up I said
[00:08:10] wow and and you know me you know how I
[00:08:13] wake up right I wake up
[00:08:15] clouds next to my head because I'm so
[00:08:17] tall
[00:08:19] and I went outside I said you know why
[00:08:22] is my neck aching I noticed that my neck
[00:08:23] was kind of aching here and I was like
[00:08:25] you know what no big deal
[00:08:27] and uh despite my neck hurting I still
[00:08:30] dead lifted today which probably was a
[00:08:32] bad idea but it is what it is now it
[00:08:34] hurts more I'm fine but turning this way
[00:08:37] kind of hurts luckily Chad's over there
[00:08:38] so we're chilling
[00:08:40] um I think it's just not like Too Tall
[00:08:42] that's why but it's fine it doesn't hurt
[00:08:44] like bad probably should have taken an
[00:08:46] Advil but it is what it is I just like
[00:08:48] yeah but now it's getting better so it's
[00:08:50] fine
[00:08:51] um
[00:08:52] oh
[00:08:56] yeah today we're going to be exploring
[00:08:59] and spending resin and
[00:09:03] everything else uh we need to watch the
[00:09:05] blade trailer
[00:09:06] we need to caulk and I want to I want to
[00:09:10] get Kai skin because I want to make a
[00:09:11] Kai video and
[00:09:13] there's a new Abyss soon
[00:09:20] wait what else is there let's just skip
[00:09:21] two more streams for Kaya's skin no I'm
[00:09:24] gonna get it today hey
[00:09:26] we need to set the record straight show
[00:09:28] that I'm actually sure
[00:09:30] because there's been some misinformation
[00:09:31] floating
[00:09:33] um and
[00:09:35] I want to get this dude I got all the
[00:09:38] Challenger achievements and then they
[00:09:39] released a new one oh no I don't even
[00:09:40] have this one the [ __ ]
[00:09:42] oh yeah but okay yeah but the [ __ ]
[00:09:44] unusual hilly troll sucks but anyways
[00:09:46] there at least a new one I didn't even
[00:09:47] notice so we should finish this
[00:09:49] um
[00:09:52] so yeah
[00:09:53] God thinks that you won
[00:09:56] hahaha
[00:10:00] Envy got skin in one second okay you're
[00:10:03] bad anyways welcome to the stream
[00:10:06] um
[00:10:07] that's like I thought to talk about I
[00:10:08] don't know yeah I want to play Star rail
[00:10:10] again when blade and Kafka are out so we
[00:10:12] might prep today or soon and then I'll
[00:10:14] do that
[00:10:15] uh but mostly we're just gungeting
[00:10:20] oh and I want to make it okay also this
[00:10:22] if we're actually hitting 100K Mora
[00:10:25] right I mean 100K Vermillion resin I
[00:10:29] want to make a video on that but I don't
[00:10:30] know
[00:10:32] I think we should spend more resin first
[00:10:35] like we need to make sure we actually
[00:10:36] spend 100K so I think we do like another
[00:10:38] like
[00:10:39] couple hundred like 100 runs or
[00:10:41] something we just do a few more runs
[00:10:42] just to make sure kill another 100 Rune
[00:10:44] graders to make sure and then we make
[00:10:47] the video and then I think I'll make two
[00:10:48] videos one will be the 100K resin on
[00:10:51] Vermillion what did it get me right what
[00:10:52] did it get my show and then another one
[00:10:54] could be the the rank one ayato video
[00:10:56] but that could be second Channel like I
[00:10:58] tried to farm trial instead I got rank
[00:11:00] one ayato and then that's two right
[00:11:01] there boom but I don't know if that'll
[00:11:03] be redundant we'll see anyways welcome

[00:34:27] free Primo gems and then I gave them my
[00:34:30] password

[00:37:17] excuse

[00:41:21] survey because I figured you know what
[00:41:23] might as well do it while people are
[00:41:25] rejoining the stream anyways

[00:42:14] Candace do might as well next
[00:42:17] you like chichi
[00:42:25] Gigi's cool how satisfied are you with
[00:42:28] the following up okay guys
[00:42:30] if there is any sliver of a chance that
[00:42:33] Chichi gets a buff we have to click
[00:42:35] unsatisfied for uh strength
[00:42:37] and I think that's the only one that
[00:42:39] matters right maybe control no but
[00:42:41] controls whatever
[00:42:42] controls whatever art is cool I mean
[00:42:45] it's Chichi uh characterization
[00:42:49] I don't know what that word means
[00:42:52] uh but I'm just gonna say satisfied I
[00:42:55] don't know what that means uh voice over
[00:42:57] yeah
[00:43:03] yeah how suitable is Chichi's aesthetic
[00:43:06] design
[00:43:13] able
[00:43:14] uh I don't remember what she looks like
[00:43:17] I actually I've never like I don't look
[00:43:20] at like clothes that much I don't know
[00:43:22] what the [ __ ] she's wearing I just know
[00:43:23] she has like the Talisman thing but like
[00:43:26] I don't the only character I've examined
[00:43:28] is like I'll hide them ciao but like I
[00:43:30] don't and there
[00:43:33] you just saw her okay I know what Chichi
[00:43:36] looks like but I don't know like the
[00:43:37] details of her like outfit because like
[00:43:39] the aesthetic design is about like the
[00:43:41] details I don't [ __ ] remember
[00:43:45] uh let's just say it's suitable like I
[00:43:46] like chichi is there any feedback
[00:43:51] yes thank you for asking thank you I am
[00:43:56] so grateful
[00:43:59] here is a few ideas to consider
[00:44:06] okay one
[00:44:10] Elemental particles any amount
[00:44:15] from her Elemental skill
[00:44:17] when
[00:44:19] when again Shin impactian character uses
[00:44:24] an elemental skill
[00:44:26] two things are certain
[00:44:29] one
[00:44:30] it has an effect
[00:44:33] two it generates energy energy particles
[00:44:38] in Chichi's case while there is arguably
[00:44:42] an effect
[00:44:44] the energy part icles seem to be missing
[00:44:49] perhaps a simple accident haha it
[00:44:54] happens no big deal
[00:44:56] please resolve this if possible thank
[00:45:00] you
[00:45:02] two
[00:45:04] when
[00:45:06] Chichi uses
[00:45:08] her Elemental burst
[00:45:11] which is called uh Chichi heel
[00:45:15] that's not what it's called talisman
[00:45:18] of the forest of the ice
[00:45:22] uh
[00:45:24] should
[00:45:26] actually no no no she's a standard
[00:45:28] character more impactful constellations
[00:45:32] her C6 should summon baiju to fight
[00:45:37] alongside her on field
[00:45:40] three
[00:45:44] actually that's enough honestly just
[00:45:45] give you energy also she could she could
[00:45:47] do more like the cooldown E cooldown is
[00:45:51] 30 seconds
[00:45:53] do you know how much time 30 seconds is
[00:45:59] kazua can use his Elemental burst kazua
[00:46:04] slash two times in the the time that
[00:46:08] Chichi can use
[00:46:10] her poor excuse for a skill once
[00:46:30] okay
[00:46:31] now keep in mind chat they do have my IP
[00:46:34] so I don't want to submit any troll
[00:46:36] answers on be serious but this is
[00:46:38] definitely serious let me correct the
[00:46:40] spelling mistakes
[00:46:46] I honestly think this is I actually
[00:46:48] think they're all cool but maybe I could
[00:46:49] just like
[00:46:51] yeah just refine it a little
[00:46:56] telling me I actually like zombie I like
[00:46:58] them
[00:46:59] oh
[00:47:02] I like I I see a lot of his art strength
[00:47:06] um
[00:47:07] yeah he's like like he's good at being a
[00:47:10] shielder I like I actually like drawing
[00:47:12] me I like zhangi characterization
[00:47:15] yeah
[00:47:17] control movement I mean I don't think
[00:47:19] that matters that's the same for every
[00:47:20] [ __ ] character no character I guess
[00:47:22] like Yay Miko feels weird on field
[00:47:24] because you right here right now emerge
[00:47:26] but other than that everyone feels the
[00:47:28] same I like talking I like strongly
[00:47:31] um
[00:47:33] please arc on skin I am begging
[00:47:37] that's only feedback
[00:47:52] how much you like Bennett Ben is pretty
[00:47:54] cool that is pretty cool but it's cool
[00:47:57] he's strong arguably the best character
[00:47:59] in the game but if you argue your Dom is
[00:48:01] the best character in the game I like
[00:48:02] him a lot he's great he's good he's good
[00:48:05] even when he's not supposed to be good
[00:48:06] he's a four star
[00:48:08] uh he's wholesome
[00:48:11] he's cool
[00:48:15] I think the only thing I would argue is
[00:48:18] that maybe he shouldn't be shopping at
[00:48:20] Gap Kids that's the only thing I think
[00:48:23] people would like him more I get it he's
[00:48:24] just like you know like a like a just
[00:48:26] like a child exploring like a teen
[00:48:28] exploring
[00:48:29] you know it is what it is it's like a
[00:48:31] suitable outfit for him but it does look
[00:48:34] like he shops at gab kids which makes
[00:48:35] people not play him I get it so we'll do
[00:48:38] somewhat satisfied but I'm just saying
[00:48:40] he could get a skin I'm not even saying
[00:48:42] his outfit's bad I'm just think he could
[00:48:43] get a skin that's it that's all I'm
[00:48:45] saying
[00:48:46] very suitable I think it does that make
[00:48:48] sense
[00:48:49] Bennett skin
[00:48:51] with extra drip would
[00:48:55] be very smart
[00:48:58] please do
[00:49:01] oh if you like Candace
[00:49:03] wait she's out
[00:49:09] I don't remember
[00:49:16] the only thing I remember about Candace
[00:49:18] is um
[00:49:20] yes she came out yeah okay true but they
[00:49:23] remember what Candace is her mic was
[00:49:24] peeking
[00:49:26] when we're doing the story Quest
[00:49:30] that's actually you need a de-esser for
[00:49:32] that I had that problem when I was
[00:49:33] recording guides back in the day I still
[00:49:34] sometimes had that problem but the mic
[00:49:36] was peaking on the s's you want a uh a
[00:49:39] de-esser to lower your sounds down
[00:49:42] you made a guide on her no I didn't
[00:49:47] I think she's cool though
[00:49:55] uh
[00:50:00] wait it's just wait
[00:50:03] I have another question
[00:50:06] do you have any other suggestions

[01:06:40] because of something
[01:06:43] okay I don't think this is what we're
[01:06:44] talking about at all but I definitely I
[01:06:47] have this thing where anytime I have an
[01:06:48] important conversation or something
[01:06:50] memorable I remember vividly what I was
[01:06:54] doing while I was having the
[01:06:56] conversation like for example it's like
[01:06:58] a lot of times I like to fidget okay not
[01:07:00] fidget but like if I'm like talking to
[01:07:02] someone
[01:07:03] like I'll have like a call like a lot of
[01:07:05] this shit's online right it's like
[01:07:06] anytime I have something I like like
[01:07:08] that's it like dude like let's say
[01:07:09] there's like a serious meeting I'll
[01:07:11] pretend I'm there like I will be there
[01:07:13] but I'll be like the practice range on
[01:07:15] like Valerian or OverWatch or something
[01:07:16] and I'll like remember what I'm doing
[01:07:19] whatever any part of the conversation
[01:07:21] happens
[01:07:22] like like
[01:07:24] I don't know if I can think of an
[01:07:26] example but like
[01:07:34] like
[01:07:35] um freeze
[01:07:39] I actually don't remember like
[01:07:47] okay well I don't remember what it was
[01:07:48] about but I remember there's like this
[01:07:50] one like sponsor like meeting I was in
[01:07:53] or whatever I was in like a zoom call or
[01:07:55] some [ __ ]
[01:07:56] I don't remember what it was but like
[01:07:57] obviously I probably can't talk about
[01:07:59] anyways but there's like something and I
[01:08:00] remember I was just like [ __ ] I was
[01:08:03] like I was doing the like Valerian
[01:08:05] course where you're just like bee
[01:08:06] hopping around like the [ __ ] practice
[01:08:07] range the whole time I was still
[01:08:09] listening I was still there but like
[01:08:11] yeah I just remember like the
[01:08:12] conversation based on what I was doing
[01:08:16] what's the hurry
[01:08:23] wait this thing is it's down
[01:08:27] hi sir
[01:08:40] that's really no but like
[01:08:43] I can focus without doing anything but
[01:08:45] also sometimes it just like
[01:08:48] yeah I feel like everyone does that
[01:08:49] though I just feel like
[01:08:51] I get bored or I can't pay attention as
[01:08:53] much like I can pay attention when it's
[01:08:55] interesting
[01:08:57] but if there's a lot of like down time I
[01:08:59] like to be doing something in the
[01:09:01] background
[01:09:07] not like when I'm in class like when I
[01:09:10] was in like class I would be able to
[01:09:12] focus without doing [ __ ] slips because
[01:09:15] it's interesting like I care like I
[01:09:16] think law is really cool
[01:09:18] but if it's like if I'm in front of my
[01:09:20] computer I like to fidget with something
[01:09:22] or like I'll be on get you like oh I
[01:09:24] talked about this I remember chainsaw
[01:09:26] man because I was doing the sumeru
[01:09:28] desert quest with jet so I remember like
[01:09:32] I remember parts of chainsawline based
[01:09:34] on where I was in the quest I remember
[01:09:36] getting stuck at one part where there
[01:09:37] was like I have to like go through the
[01:09:39] pyramid
[01:09:40] and then like the floor was sinking
[01:09:44] someone else can explain but I don't
[01:09:46] want to do the quest so I wanted to
[01:09:48] unlock the waypoints
[01:09:51] I did by the way I did part two off
[01:09:53] stream I did the quest part two off
[01:09:55] stream
[01:09:56] so you guys should be uh proud of me
[01:10:05] oh so you
[01:10:07] man okay
[01:10:09] you killed it mid-saw man
[01:10:13] okay that's actually pretty good
[01:10:20] [Laughter]
[01:10:22] I enjoyed it well I haven't finished it
[01:10:25] yet I'm not caught up
[01:10:40] it's Peak dude people call everything
[01:10:42] either mid or Peak there's nothing in
[01:10:44] between
[01:10:45] why is there nothing that's just good
[01:10:51] everything's either mid or Peak
[01:11:04] the hydro eidolons have more personality
[01:11:07] than gone you
[01:11:09] know
[01:11:11] no comment no comment no comment no
[01:11:13] comment
[01:11:15] no comment
[01:11:17] for legal reasons I didn't react to that
[01:11:21] but how do I get that yo yo
[01:11:23] well how do I get that what the [ __ ]
[01:11:25] maybe I go like scarra
[01:11:34] where's my exploration team I had one
[01:11:41] oh it is
[01:11:45] Fury
[01:11:50] he wondered
[01:11:53] a non-donated one dollar there's a
[01:11:55] dollar as a psych student and someone
[01:11:57] who has ADHD it's not the lack of
[01:12:00] attention it's trouble with attention
[01:12:02] regulation if something isn't engaging
[01:12:04] enough her brain will go back every time
[01:12:08] the HD allegations you describe
[01:12:12] okay so you're a student not a a
[01:12:15] licensed professional so I will not take
[01:12:17] your uh advice also I took three
[01:12:20] psychology classes therefore I'm a psych
[01:12:23] student therefore I know best
[01:12:33] haha
[01:12:43] who says there aren't benefits I think I
[01:12:45] say death notice between mid and Peak
[01:12:47] it's just in the middle okay I think
[01:12:49] that though it was okay well I'm gonna
[01:12:52] spoil it if I talk about it but like the
[01:12:53] first part was good and then it fell off
[01:12:56] but it was my first anime so like it has
[01:12:59] a special place in my heart man's in
[01:13:01] denial I think the first part was really
[01:13:03] really good and then it became
[01:13:05] like whatever
[01:13:12] but also I saw a meme that like the show
[01:13:15] could have ended in like three episodes
[01:13:16] if L was just like you know what I have
[01:13:19] a hunch and then hit light with a car I
[01:13:21] was just like [ __ ] it and then just ran
[01:13:22] him over I think that would have been
[01:13:24] the best ending
[01:13:25] that would have been Peak
[01:13:31] like you know what that's a pretty good
[01:13:33] chance [ __ ] it
[01:13:42] but also like that's the that's like the
[01:13:44] first anime I watched it was like it
[01:13:45] made me because I used to only watch
[01:13:47] shows and I was like you know what maybe
[01:13:48] it's like I watched I was like damn
[01:13:51] maybe I should like I will watch anime
[01:14:03] we're going back
[01:14:08] I have to beat the alligator okay so I
[01:14:10] saw some pretty serious uh uh
[01:14:12] allegations being thrown around that I
[01:14:15] was bad at exploring laughable and um
[01:14:18] unrelatable because of how bad I was so
[01:14:20] I need to basically beat those and show
[01:14:23] you guys that no I'm actually an
[01:14:24] exploration God so from this point

[01:47:01] I was like trying to Akash or crit value
[01:47:03] it bro I was on it reminiscence also I
[01:47:07] noticed something he he used the Xiao
[01:47:09] command in my chat
[01:47:11] and I didn't notice this but the show
[01:47:13] command in my chat
[01:47:15] current Xiao build do you know when this
[01:47:17] links to
[01:47:19] February
[01:47:20] 2021 and you know what the most [ __ ]
[01:47:23] up part is
[01:47:25] look at how good this ratio is for two
[01:47:28] years ago over two years
[01:47:33] February 2021
[01:47:37] and my Vermilion looks like that
[01:47:40] okay I mean I don't know why not once I
[01:47:43] don't know what my career build is but
[01:47:44] literally this is like the same level as
[01:47:46] my Vermilion so I could
[01:47:49] like look at the characters
[01:48:02] yeah so uh yeah
[01:48:08] uh we wasted a lot of resin since then
[01:48:11] and I still think my two piece two piece
[01:48:13] is better
[01:48:17] but his best character is kaching and he
[01:48:20] acts like my kitchen isn't effortlessly
[01:48:22] broken
[01:48:25] series a joke you can strongbox this
[01:48:26] [ __ ] with your eyes closed everyone has
[01:48:28] a good thundering Fury
[01:48:30] everyone look at these people look at
[01:48:32] this circle
[01:48:33] look at this circling everyone
[01:48:36] everyone's kitchen looks like this okay
[01:48:38] not true but
[01:48:42] but also I don't have a lot of em
[01:48:44] because I'm on attack sound so usually I
[01:48:45] do like uh this with this weapon with
[01:48:48] most weapons attack and Em are
[01:48:49] interchangeable in kaching but since I'm
[01:48:51] using a light of foliar I want em does
[01:48:53] that make sense that makes sense
[01:48:57] yeah all of my characters are better
[01:48:58] than my show I mean that's not true my
[01:49:00] show is good but my Vermilion isn't okay
[01:49:01] let's go to the actual Vermillion
[01:49:11] okay
[01:49:29] I think we just [ __ ] over our scar
[01:49:30] though
[01:49:32] that's not oh I have 99 good rate
[01:49:36] sorry sorry I know what that was
[01:49:39] ah I don't like that okay we're gonna go
[01:49:42] Jade I think
[01:49:45] wait why is my criterate so high I guess
[01:49:46] because of this but I think that's my
[01:49:48] best one
[01:49:50] foreign
[01:49:57] this one's not bad
[01:50:04] you know what [ __ ] it what if this guy
[01:50:06] Couldn't Write [ __ ] it
[01:50:24] this could be good Chris damage attacker
[01:50:26] set it could be 40 crit value could have
[01:50:28] 40 crit damage
[01:50:31] you never know till you know honestly
[01:50:33] you never know till you know okay now
[01:50:34] you know I mean attack's not bad but
[01:50:39] um
[01:50:43] whoa
[01:50:45] whoa
[01:50:59] uh this one
[01:51:03] foreign
[01:51:04] this is tough man
[01:51:14] okay my shot's actually best on vortex
[01:51:18] [ __ ]
[01:51:21] ah yeah I'm probably a homer Andy but I
[01:51:23] need more criterate
[01:51:25] but let me filter by crit rate
[01:51:35] okay never mind
[01:51:39] go Jade yeah maybe but then I can't use
[01:51:42] this flower I think this is our best
[01:51:43] flower on Vermillion like we can't use
[01:51:45] it now
[01:51:54] wait wait which one's better from these
[01:51:55] two
[01:51:57] uh
[01:51:59] [Music]
[01:52:00] uh the [ __ ]
[01:52:02] [ __ ] him
[01:52:03] I mean this one I guess but it's less
[01:52:05] crit damage
[01:52:12] Ironic song Why is it ironic
[01:52:18] why is it ironic
[01:52:27] yeah the crit damage is better for our
[01:52:29] ratio I do agree
[01:52:41] wait how much yeah I have 130 EDM
[01:52:50] dude my show from February 2021 is
[01:52:55] arguably better look at my inventory
[01:52:57] there's still a four star in my when I
[01:53:00] filter by level look there's still a
[01:53:02] four star here
[01:53:03] there's still a four star that's how
[01:53:05] early this was

[01:59:40] anyways we need Kaya skin how close are
[01:59:42] we
[01:59:47] are pretty close
[01:59:49] wait so did I finish this area you guys
[01:59:51] were acting like it was gonna take me a
[01:59:52] year I did that in like maybe what four
[01:59:54] minutes
[02:00:00] like two seconds
[02:00:13] laughs
[02:00:19] dude why
[02:00:21] dude I literally already answered you
[02:00:24] this guy has been asking me one two
[02:00:27] three four
[02:00:33] five
[02:00:34] arguably six dude why does this guy keep
[02:00:38] asking me why do I hate Dory everything
[02:00:40] about her is a waste she's [ __ ] dog
[02:00:44] [ __ ] dog [ __ ] of a unit who wasn't even
[02:00:46] good before dendro and then after deadro
[02:00:48] now is just a waste of oxygen there's
[02:00:50] like 20 characters that could replace
[02:00:51] her the only thing cool about her is her
[02:00:53] [ __ ] purple slime she's also
[02:00:55] borderline a racial stereotype on top of
[02:00:57] that her whole story aspect is just
[02:01:00] being a scammer so no one likes her and
[02:01:02] then on top of that she's just not good
[02:01:04] in any team except child double dendro
[02:01:07] Dory which is a genuinely fun team play
[02:01:09] it but other than that why is Dory even
[02:01:11] a thing
[02:01:15] that's all
[02:01:19] her theme's good her theme's actually
[02:01:21] good her theme is actually banger
[02:01:23] yeah she ruined cavi's life
[02:01:36] also I saw a clip on like I don't know
[02:01:39] where I think it's like YouTube shorts
[02:01:40] I'm someone being like
[02:01:43] if you answer if you ask a question in
[02:01:45] chat twice and it doesn't get answered
[02:01:47] the streamer saw it but your question
[02:01:49] was dumb true actually true like look
[02:01:52] listen I read every message thank every
[02:01:55] follow thank every sub answer every
[02:01:56] question but if you ask something
[02:01:58] multiple times that it doesn't get
[02:01:59] answered it's probably a dumb question
[02:02:02] it is what it is
[02:02:06] also the child double Dental Dory team
[02:02:09] is the forbidden knowledge that Nikita
[02:02:10] was talking about
[02:02:12] and no one has tested it and no one has
[02:02:14] played it so be warned it is Uncharted
[02:02:17] grounds
[02:02:25] okay let's
[02:02:27] um we finished we finished this area
[02:02:28] right or like there's like one chest you
[02:02:30] didn't get but
[02:02:34] plus six Giga Chad thank you
[02:02:43] dude retro version is actually good this
[02:02:45] Abyss like no cope
[02:02:46] actually no cope
[02:02:54] no copium
[02:02:59] even in that team she is she arguably
[02:03:02] isn't she wait what are you saying is
[02:03:05] she worse than kooky in that team listen
[02:03:07] okay listen here is why Forbidden
[02:03:10] Knowledge exists people ask me about the
[02:03:12] Forbidden Knowledge team here's why it
[02:03:13] exists okay and I haven't even tested it
[02:03:15] well I did but not with the level 90
[02:03:16] Dory here's why it's a theorized team
[02:03:19] okay because child okay who applies
[02:03:22] arguably too much Hydro child he applies
[02:03:25] a [ __ ] on a hydro Riptide AO weeps so
[02:03:28] what do you want with that well you want
[02:03:31] to make use of it so you're gonna go
[02:03:33] double dendro
[02:03:34] and so
[02:03:36] what what is the fastest Electro how can
[02:03:40] you get the most off-beeled Electro well
[02:03:42] it's gonna be applying Electro Electro
[02:03:43] Electro you could be like oh right in
[02:03:45] okay but what about Dory
[02:03:48] what about a character who's Electro
[02:03:50] will will be applied will be hit we'll
[02:03:55] have an instance of Electro damage every
[02:03:57] 0.4 seconds so fast Hydro fast Electro
[02:04:01] and then you dendro to make up for it
[02:04:04] Forbidden Knowledge the only thing is no
[02:04:06] one wants to level Dory to try it
[02:04:11] it's actually The Forbidden Knowledge
[02:04:14] [ __ ] Forbidden Knowledge hyperloom
[02:04:16] team
[02:04:18] okay Dory is not good and her uptime is
[02:04:21] absolute dog [ __ ] and her energy
[02:04:22] generation is dog [ __ ] and every but but
[02:04:27] you can't deny the fact that her Electro
[02:04:29] app is genuinely fast it's 0.4 seconds
[02:04:33] point four there's no ICD on [ __ ]
[02:04:36] cores they're all individual things
[02:04:38] point four that's why that team is like
[02:04:41] theorized because isn't kooky like once
[02:04:43] a second or some [ __ ]
[02:04:46] oh no that's right 1.5
[02:04:49] 1.5
[02:04:59] yeah ryden's point nine
[02:05:03] like is kooky
[02:05:04] our character than Dory in like
[02:05:06] basically every single way yes
[02:05:08] yes however however in the Forbidden
[02:05:11] Knowledge meta team where you only do
[02:05:13] one rotation and then you just wait for
[02:05:15] like 10 seconds
[02:05:17] uh-huh uh-huh
[02:05:19] uh-huh uh-huh
[02:05:22] uh-huh
[02:05:24] what's your progress memory of chaos
[02:05:25] dude I haven't played star real since
[02:05:27] our last stream we actually need to like
[02:05:28] grind it I've just been playing a bit
[02:05:29] off stream to like spend some stamina
[02:05:31] but yeah I I need to play more
[02:05:34] the team is too cursed no the problem
[02:05:36] with is I can't play it because you need
[02:05:38] okay hyperbloom scales on reactions the
[02:05:41] damage from level 80 to 90 is like 30
[02:05:43] less or some [ __ ] 30 I know Bloom is
[02:05:45] like 34. hyper level is similar so like
[02:05:48] I would need to ascend Dory to 90 and I
[02:05:52] don't want to do that I do not want to
[02:05:54] do that
[02:05:59] huh
[02:06:04] yeah also Dory Dory is a battery that
[02:06:07] needs a battery kind of like Electro MC

[02:18:02] leave him oh a tail as old as time John
[02:18:05] was a hotel Main and as a hotel main he
[02:18:08] felt pressured to get for staff of Houma
[02:18:11] and her C1 unfortunately this happened
[02:18:14] during the Homa Wolf's gravestone banner
[02:18:16] before the weapon pity happened he ended
[02:18:19] up getting four Wolf's gravestones
[02:18:21] before his staff of Houma and in a fit
[02:18:23] of range took his wife's uh savings well
[02:18:26] their savings that they were planning on
[02:18:28] getting a new house together uh and
[02:18:30] expand the kitchen which was much too
[02:18:33] small and needed an expansion to spend
[02:18:35] on the Houma Banner instead uh after
[02:18:38] that carfuffle his wife said no John
[02:18:41] this is the last time you spend money on
[02:18:44] that stupid gotcha game of yours I am
[02:18:46] leaving you and that was the last straw
[02:18:48] and that is why John's uh wife left him
[02:18:52] John is now a changed man who has
[02:18:55] reformed and changed his ways and is now
[02:18:57] a much better person following that
[02:18:59] incident with that in mind his wife

[02:21:39] now I can record my Kai guide I actually
[02:21:41] recorded artifacts and weapons ready
[02:21:42] without the Skin So if you're wondering
[02:21:44] why the video half it's not gonna have
[02:21:46] the skin on that's why
[02:21:54] balls
[02:22:07] dumb we actually got [ __ ] kind of
[02:22:09] skin I'm hyped
[02:22:11] now we can play him oh also aren't we
[02:22:13] getting a new Abyss okay that's another
[02:22:15] thing I wanted to do a clear with him
[02:22:17] but if we're getting a new Abyss then by
[02:22:19] the time the video is edited and out
[02:22:21] okay I need to upload the beta one right
[02:22:23] now before it changes but the because I
[02:22:25] already record all the footage but for
[02:22:27] um Kaya I should probably wait and then
[02:22:29] as soon as it changes I do that
[02:22:32] yeah literally tomorrow
[02:22:34] I don't know if it's gonna be good or
[02:22:35] bad for him but all good I mean Kai is
[02:22:37] always good
[02:22:38] because you can either reverse melt or
[02:22:40] freeze so there's never been an abyss
[02:22:41] where I didn't clear with them because
[02:22:43] he's in my like four star team okay let
[02:22:45] me equip the skin Point what am I doing
[02:22:49] we could do it clear now but if the ABY
[02:22:51] is about to change too then
[02:22:53] wait chat what should I do
[02:22:55] try stream tomorrow at 4am as soon as
[02:22:58] it's out no it's 5 a.m nah I should
[02:23:01] probably just early stream the day after
[02:23:02] because I can only stream at 5am like
[02:23:04] the second it's out or just the next day
[02:23:06] like like at like 1pm or something I'll
[02:23:09] probably do that just not early yeah
[02:23:12] knowing me it'll be like 6 p.m not one
[02:23:14] but yeah we'll see we'll see
[02:23:18] oh look at him
[02:23:21] I like the skin
[02:23:28] all right controversy time let's rank
[02:23:30] every skin from best to worst
[02:23:32] [ __ ] it [ __ ] it hey [ __ ] it well right
[02:23:35] every skin in the shop
[02:23:41] wokeage
[02:23:45] okay
[02:23:50] wait is there a tearless template
[02:23:55] uh tier list genshin impact skin
[02:24:02] there is one
[02:24:03] oh
[02:24:06] there is one
[02:24:13] all right throw things off we have
[02:24:15] Barbara I like the little ducky that is
[02:24:17] the only thing I mean the rest is kind
[02:24:18] of cute
[02:24:20] it is actually a pretty big upgrade but
[02:24:21] I think the ducky is the best part ducky
[02:24:23] is Ducky alone makes it like a tier the
[02:24:26] rest is like kind of whatever take it or
[02:24:28] leave it but I think the ducky alone
[02:24:29] makes it a tier
[02:24:33] Barbara a cause the duck Jean
[02:24:36] what I like the Jean skin but I also
[02:24:39] really like this one and her default is
[02:24:40] pretty good too
[02:24:41] so I think it's kind of whatever like I
[02:24:43] like it it's the one I use but this
[02:24:45] one's also really good and you have to
[02:24:46] pay for it now so it's like
[02:24:48] I just use this one
[02:24:59] I like the alternate ones too I wasn't
[02:25:01] gonna
[02:25:03] yeah you always have to pay for it too
[02:25:04] yeah so I think like it's cool but B
[02:25:08] this one's also really dude low-key this
[02:25:10] looks kind of a
[02:25:11] I like this redesign especially because
[02:25:13] it's free like
[02:25:15] between these two I think they're
[02:25:16] interchangeable but this one's free all
[02:25:17] right
[02:25:19] all right Rosario oh no
[02:25:23] okay I'm gonna get some [ __ ] for this
[02:25:24] one
[02:25:28] I'm gonna get some [ __ ] for this one
[02:25:32] okay I've seen people really like this
[02:25:35] I don't get it like okay I think the her
[02:25:38] first one is kind of like this one is
[02:25:40] like definitely fan service I was like a
[02:25:42] nun it doesn't really make sense to have
[02:25:44] this outfit I get it but look the
[02:25:47] service worked I'm sorry I'm sorry
[02:25:48] respectfully but this one is just like
[02:25:51] the I just feel like this looks like a
[02:25:53] school outfit I don't know I feel like
[02:25:54] it's kind of weird
[02:25:55] it's not my favorite
[02:25:57] like I don't even like the I don't know
[02:25:58] I don't know I don't know I I'm not a
[02:26:00] big fan of it uh
[02:26:04] it's not bad I just don't think it suits
[02:26:07] her but even like I think
[02:26:10] I don't know
[02:26:15] I don't know I haven't figured out why I
[02:26:17] don't like it I just know that I don't
[02:26:18] like it but I don't know why
[02:26:33] the color
[02:26:36] yeah also why is her skin gray I didn't
[02:26:39] even notice this
[02:26:40] she's literally like
[02:26:43] love is she sick sudge
[02:26:46] anyways
[02:26:48] yeah it's not like if you like it I
[02:26:51] respect you not my cup of tea
[02:26:53] a Mona one this one I also don't use but
[02:26:56] I don't think it's bad
[02:26:59] wait I actually forgot what does it look
[02:27:00] like
[02:27:03] why is it a different shade of blue
[02:27:07] wait okay okay okay I think the outfit
[02:27:10] is like it's kind of cool but why is the
[02:27:11] color that
[02:27:19] Monas is gorgeous wait really I think
[02:27:22] the color doesn't
[02:27:31] wait let me actually look at it I think
[02:27:32] the Hat's cooler okay let me be let me
[02:27:35] let me give it let me give it let me
[02:27:37] give it to you straight okay I like the
[02:27:38] Hat better I like the sleeves better I
[02:27:41] don't know why the shorts are that shade
[02:27:42] of blue though
[02:27:44] I think it's like
[02:27:48] okay I feel weird examining the
[02:27:49] character this much but
[02:27:58] okay I do think it's weird that she just
[02:27:59] has like underwear
[02:28:01] or like a bathing suit whereas here's
[02:28:03] like more like okay
[02:28:05] I don't know I think it's okay I think
[02:28:07] it's okay I think I I don't like the
[02:28:09] color change but I think it's okay
[02:28:11] I don't think it's bad I think it's all
[02:28:13] right I'll put a b
[02:28:15] Amber I have not seen the Amber one I I
[02:28:18] don't even know what amber looks like
[02:28:23] oh I kind of like the red over the brown
[02:28:31] they changed much it okay it doesn't
[02:28:34] change much but like
[02:28:41] the brown is more iconic it also matches
[02:28:44] her hair
[02:28:49] okay I actually the more I look at it
[02:28:51] the more it's kind of whatever
[02:28:53] it's not bad though I don't think it's
[02:28:54] bad it's just whatever
[02:29:02] yes whatever it's not bad it's just
[02:29:04] whatever
[02:29:06] uh since it's not bad or whatever that's
[02:29:08] C and then it was like okay let's look
[02:29:10] at that let's look at the actual ones
[02:29:11] now like the the like shot like the
[02:29:13] event ones or the shop ones
[02:29:15] all right let's look at the actual ones
[02:29:16] okay so uh we'll start with uh Lisa
[02:29:20] hello hey Lisa so this is what the
[02:29:23] normal Lisa looks like also this skin
[02:29:25] made me realize Lisa's eyes aren't
[02:29:27] purple I thought they were okay
[02:29:30] I like it I actually [ __ ] with it
[02:29:33] I [ __ ] with it the little beret
[02:29:39] yeah I really like it
[02:29:43] does their shoe chain yeah our shoes
[02:29:44] change
[02:29:50] I like it it looks like a different
[02:29:51] character I think
[02:29:54] dude why did I think I guess maybe it's
[02:29:56] because I'm used to looking at Ryden but
[02:29:57] I swear Lisa had like purple eyes purple
[02:30:00] hair
[02:30:01] I think I'm just thinking of writing
[02:30:04] I like the hairstyle chain shoe yeah I
[02:30:05] like this I like the skin a lot this is
[02:30:07] either ARS
[02:30:09] what are we thinking what did I put in a
[02:30:10] already
[02:30:11] I think it's better than Gene the gene
[02:30:13] skin
[02:30:15] but I don't know if it's better than the
[02:30:16] Barbara one
[02:30:17] actually it probably is
[02:30:24] we'll put it out we'll put it up
[02:30:27] it did make me play it did make me level
[02:30:30] Lisa
[02:30:31] okay we'll put it s for now if we have
[02:30:33] to change it we'll change it but dude
[02:30:35] look at what's coming up
[02:30:38] dude this is the easiest ass of my life
[02:30:41] this is the easiest answer I I don't
[02:30:44] have to think
[02:30:46] oh my God
[02:30:49] like her default okay it makes sense Geo
[02:30:52] like Queen right makes sense and then
[02:31:04] this is so easy
[02:31:11] yeah I've been using this oh yeah I
[02:31:13] remember I had to buy this skin because
[02:31:14] I didn't do the event but yeah I've been
[02:31:16] using it since out I like it
[02:31:19] everything dude even the shoes are cool
[02:31:22] does her hair change
[02:31:24] oh it does
[02:31:29] look at her back all right GG it's
[02:31:31] actually yes it's actually it's actually
[02:31:32] us I'm I'm sorry Beto for looking it's
[02:31:34] actually s okay next kaching
[02:31:38] is good I don't think it's like a huge I
[02:31:42] don't think it's as big of an
[02:31:43] improvement as ning Wong even though
[02:31:44] they're like the same style I like it I
[02:31:47] think it was worse for me I like it
[02:31:49] but I don't think it's like as game
[02:31:51] changing because also kitchen's default
[02:31:52] is like you know it's pretty cool too
[02:31:54] I think it's like a I think it's a valid
[02:31:56] a
[02:31:57] out of respect for Barbara's ducky
[02:31:59] though I'll put it here
[02:32:01] I think it's a validate
[02:32:06] I do like the details on it I like that
[02:32:08] whatever the [ __ ] that is I like that
[02:32:10] dove
[02:32:12] okay I'll put it above Barbara I think
[02:32:14] it's a high a I like it because I'm I'm
[02:32:17] afraid I'm gonna rank everything s if I
[02:32:19] don't contain myself so we're gonna
[02:32:20] leave it high we'll leave it high eh
[02:32:26] oh she also has a choker thing though
[02:32:27] that's like way better than the default
[02:32:31] well I don't want to S it no no we'll
[02:32:33] keep it high
[02:32:35] she has hair glitter wait really
[02:32:39] oh my God she does
[02:32:42] dude
[02:32:46] give it a kiss
[02:32:50] okay here's my only problem I'm okay
[02:32:52] with putting an S but the only problem
[02:32:53] is do what about the skin that changes
[02:32:57] the animations where dude look at the
[02:33:01] Luke
[02:33:02] he goes from Grandma drip to this
[02:33:06] this needs a tier of his own and it
[02:33:09] fixes his hair
[02:33:10] like his hair is fine but then
[02:33:18] and it changes his voice lines and it
[02:33:21] changes his animations
[02:33:22] it looks so much better
[02:33:25] mid no it's not mid I think his boots
[02:33:28] should be different I think the only
[02:33:29] thing mid is like the like bottom half
[02:33:31] is the outfit is low-key the same like
[02:33:32] they could have made his boots cooler
[02:33:36] but like dude look at that coat and that
[02:33:38] [ __ ] ponytail
[02:33:42] I'm about to drop money on the skin
[02:33:43] please stop it's still deluke
[02:33:48] still better
[02:33:52] Thunder is
[02:33:54] it's a like what
[02:33:59] whatever wait let's look at the
[02:34:00] animations let me remind myself
[02:34:04] also it has different sound effects
[02:34:08] what's her objective
[02:34:13] wait see how the Flames are like a bit
[02:34:15] black
[02:34:25] look at that animation
[02:34:28] it's meh you're only saying that because
[02:34:30] you don't like the Luke
[02:34:34] I think it's cool I think it's [ __ ]
[02:34:35] sick
[02:34:45] I do admit though they could have done
[02:34:46] something like make his Flames blue or
[02:34:48] some [ __ ] so like I see that there could
[02:34:50] be more potential but in terms of what's
[02:34:52] in the game Now guide comes out the loot
[02:34:56] guide will come out
[02:35:04] uh yeah like definitely there's
[02:35:06] definitely potential to improve the skin
[02:35:08] but as far as what we have now I think
[02:35:10] it's I think it's goaded
[02:35:20] wait what I said [ __ ]
[02:35:23] what
[02:35:25] dude call it call
[02:35:30] we're making up
[02:35:31] we're making a cocktier for deluke
[02:35:35] all right next is Fishel
[02:35:38] official's really good I like special
[02:35:40] skin I feel like I'm liking every skin
[02:35:42] but I like facial skin I like it it was
[02:35:45] free I think it's cool it suits her I
[02:35:47] like the purple a lot more I don't know
[02:35:49] what it is I think this shade of purple
[02:35:51] is a lot cooler than this shade of
[02:35:53] purple this is like stand
[02:35:57] ing sets I just think it looks cooler
[02:36:02] so say I think normal official's cool I
[02:36:04] think D like I like normal officials
[02:36:07] design
[02:36:08] Ed Paradise like I've said this before
[02:36:10] I'll say it again when I wasn't sure if
[02:36:12] I was gonna play getchin I looked at the
[02:36:14] character list
[02:36:15] I was like shout looks cool the Luke
[02:36:18] looks cool
[02:36:19] official looks cool
[02:36:22] but I think this one's cooler
[02:36:26] yeah I think this one's cooler
[02:36:28] wait her eye color changes too right
[02:36:31] yeah because it's like evil official
[02:36:32] there's literally lore
[02:36:34] there's literally lore to the skin she
[02:36:37] has a white eye patch a red eye
[02:36:43] I do think Oz
[02:36:48] I do think Oz should change but I know
[02:36:50] it doesn't make sense Laura Wise because
[02:36:52] it's like a different official not a
[02:36:53] different Oz but I just think it would
[02:36:55] be cool if there's a different odds in
[02:36:56] the skin I don't know even if it didn't
[02:36:58] make sense I think it'd be cool
[02:37:05] and founded Paradise oh yeah there is
[02:37:08] like a thing on like a eye thing
[02:37:11] I like it I like the skin
[02:37:14] fiscal is so cool
[02:37:17] it's cool
[02:37:18] I think it's good
[02:37:20] um
[02:37:22] where would I rank it
[02:37:25] if I'm being honest I think it's like
[02:37:27] similar in vibe to the kitchen skin so
[02:37:29] it kind of has to be next to kashing
[02:37:33] yeah I like it and it's free like I kind
[02:37:36] of want to put an A but I think it's
[02:37:37] about as good as as kaching like I can't
[02:37:39] put kaching s and facial a does that
[02:37:41] make it but I don't want to put
[02:37:43] everything s wait I have to reconsider
[02:37:44] something
[02:37:49] what
[02:37:57] I created Another Universe and
[02:38:00] you know what I'm gonna say it a is
[02:38:02] still good a is still good I think
[02:38:04] officials here kaching's here a is still
[02:38:07] good
[02:38:08] a is still good
[02:38:14] okay officials and S for now all right
[02:38:17] next up we're gonna leave icon for last
[02:38:19] next up uh clee
[02:38:22] oh yeah I bought this without thinking
[02:38:28] [Music]
[02:38:29] uh I think I think it makes her look
[02:38:31] from it makes
[02:38:33] random ass toddler to Crimson which are
[02:38:36] Flames toddler which I think is cool
[02:38:40] I think it's cool
[02:38:45] it looks like she's like uh like
[02:38:47] Halloween
[02:38:49] what is that look like a potion
[02:38:51] and dodoco has a new fit I actually like
[02:38:54] it a lot I think it's really cool
[02:38:56] I just wish I know it probably would be
[02:38:58] more expensive if that was the case but
[02:38:59] I do wish I had like different
[02:39:00] animations kind of like the Luke
[02:39:02] I think it's really cute
[02:39:05] it's a lantern oh I forgot lanterns
[02:39:07] existed
[02:39:17] her hair we did her hair change I don't
[02:39:19] even know I don't even know what default
[02:39:20] clear looks like I have not played Queen
[02:39:22] yeah okay yeah I
[02:39:29] it's pretty good that's pretty good hey
[02:39:33] it could be S but then you realize it's
[02:39:35] clean
[02:39:36] and it's paid you also have to spend
[02:39:38] money but I think it's cute I think it's
[02:39:40] a good design
[02:39:41] I think it's a good design it's also are
[02:39:42] we not a factory price I think for the
[02:39:44] price
[02:39:45] wait Deluxe is kind of expensive but I'm
[02:39:46] saying like if I'm gonna pay
[02:39:50] but I guess kaching is also paid
[02:39:53] okay she could be above Barbara
[02:39:57] it looks better than the deluxe skin no
[02:39:59] it does not
[02:40:06] it's good though
[02:40:11] it's good
[02:40:13] I'm so heavy
[02:40:21] deluca's mid dude you don't understand
[02:40:24] okay listen you don't understand the
[02:40:27] level of glow up that his hair went from
[02:40:29] this to this you literally don't
[02:40:31] understand what those few millimeters do
[02:40:33] to his hair you actually don't
[02:40:35] understand
[02:40:37] and you guys are wrong if you disagree
[02:40:39] also his paper did his paper just change
[02:40:41] colors
[02:40:57] it's bombs so heavy
[02:41:03] okay let me actually like let me
[02:41:05] actually let me actually give an
[02:41:06] informed decision on this her gloves do
[02:41:09] get significantly cooler
[02:41:28] I think okay this is another thing
[02:41:36] do you think that this little pouch
[02:41:38] thing is a lot cooler than the [ __ ]
[02:41:40] backpack
[02:41:49] the bag suits are more I agree this
[02:41:52] suits her more but this one's cooler so
[02:41:53] who cares all right hey
[02:41:55] okay
[02:41:58] you guys just want to ask everything I'm
[02:42:00] not here for it but you know what I am
[02:42:02] here for uh giving Kaya asks where the
[02:42:04] [ __ ] is Kyle wasn't he here oh yeah
[02:42:06] where's Kaya where's Kaya kayakaya oh oh
[02:42:10] God
[02:42:15] okay to be fair I think Kyle's default
[02:42:17] looks really good too
[02:42:21] but dude look at this look at the
[02:42:23] [ __ ] look at the chest window upgrade
[02:42:25] look at this
[02:42:27] shit's damn near I'll hide them no it's
[02:42:29] not it's not but it's like half
[02:42:36] wait let me actually examine him
[02:42:42] okay his hands are definitely nicer in
[02:42:43] this skin his hair he has a ponytail
[02:42:46] well he also wait he always had I
[02:42:48] thought he had short hair wait I'm a
[02:42:50] fake Kaya fan I didn't even notice that
[02:42:52] hair what the [ __ ] whatever it's braided
[02:42:54] now he donated one dollar well I didn't
[02:42:57] even know that was his hair what the
[02:42:59] [ __ ] this is like Arlo Kino it actually
[02:43:01] jump scared me
[02:43:03] how did I not know
[02:43:10] like I've seen long hair in like art I
[02:43:13] didn't I don't know I just thought that
[02:43:14] was like part of his coat
[02:43:17] dude I've been playing kaias since 1.0
[02:43:19] he was in my original deluke team
[02:43:21] because I pulled for I got Aquila as my
[02:43:23] first five star weapon and I was like I
[02:43:24] want to use this on someone so I use the
[02:43:26] sword character
[02:43:30] it's like how people thought are the
[02:43:31] Kino had short hair same thing anyways I
[02:43:34] think it looks cooler here
[02:43:36] um
[02:43:39] I also really like the default though I
[02:43:41] think the default's sick but I do really
[02:43:42] like the skin
[02:43:44] I think the top half looks better than
[02:43:45] the bottom half but I like it a lot
[02:43:55] look at the back
[02:44:01] wait there's a back window what the [ __ ]
[02:44:04] why is there a back window
[02:44:09] okay this is
[02:44:21] he says the dialogue when you switch
[02:44:22] outfits
[02:44:32] thank you
[02:44:41] there's a little braid in his hair too a
[02:44:43] little like pin

[02:44:56] what is that dagger okay that dagger's
[02:44:58] Lit
[02:45:01] okay maybe I'm biased I like the skin I
[02:45:03] don't care
[02:45:06] um
[02:45:07] I don't think it's like the only thing
[02:45:10] is I like it a lot but I don't think if
[02:45:12] I'm being honest right I don't think
[02:45:13] it's like leagues above
[02:45:17] the other skins like I don't think it's
[02:45:19] like
[02:45:20] I think it's like on par with like
[02:45:22] police skin
[02:45:26] but I want to put an S but please a
[02:45:28] something doesn't add up
[02:45:30] something doesn't either
[02:45:56] I think this suits them though
[02:46:03] even the gloves are like whatever this
[02:46:05] is [ __ ] sick
[02:46:07] 90 him all fake balls fan mad oh my God

[02:46:39] ass lowest lowest Lewis
[02:46:41] all right we saved the best for last
[02:46:46] they served the best for last
[02:46:53] ayaka before we talk about Aiko I'll put
[02:46:55] the Luke here
[02:46:58] actually no they're looking [ __ ]
[02:47:03] okay look
[02:47:06] I like the middle part
[02:47:12] I like the middle part I think this
[02:47:13] shade of blue is or cyan is is pleasing
[02:47:16] why is she on adult
[02:47:18] s
[02:47:21] I I'm this part of the skin School
[02:47:25] I personally don't understand the boots
[02:47:31] but here's wet socks so I guess both
[02:47:33] don't really make sense
[02:47:36] but I personally don't understand the
[02:47:38] boots
[02:47:39] oh I like this ribbon thing I don't
[02:47:41] understand the boots and I also don't
[02:47:43] understand
[02:47:45] the Hat
[02:47:49] um
[02:47:50] I like the hair I think her hair is cool
[02:47:53] I wish you could unequip the Hat
[02:47:56] like with your lawn I like how her
[02:47:58] jackets off but I think it'd be cool to
[02:48:00] have the options either equip or unequip
[02:48:01] with her you should have the option to
[02:48:03] hat or no hat I think the hair is cool I
[02:48:06] think the dress like the ribbon's kind
[02:48:07] of cool but I don't get the hat I don't
[02:48:10] get the boots if I'm being honest
[02:48:13] a blade Embraces
[02:48:17] um
[02:48:19] the hat is cute
[02:48:22] sure I like the flower on her like
[02:48:25] legging thing or like whatever those are
[02:48:27] called
[02:48:31] Cherry but
[02:48:35] it's her
[02:48:37] I think the outfit I think most of it
[02:48:39] does I don't get the boots the boots
[02:48:41] don't tell me ayaka neither does the Hat
[02:49:05] full theater donate to ten dollars now
[02:49:08] level 90 die look next people live
[02:49:14] okay look when I when I like
[02:49:18] disassociate my eyes when I like unfocus
[02:49:20] and I just look as a whole
[02:49:22] I think this outfit's kind of cute but
[02:49:24] then I look at the boots and I'm like
[02:49:25] why are they there like I feel like they
[02:49:27] shouldn't be and then cherishes their
[02:49:30] gems this is how you play right you're
[02:49:32] like looking at her like this
[02:49:39] foreign
[02:49:53] I think this is sick and there's like
[02:49:56] Shader like the the the the dig a
[02:49:59] [ __ ] purple to Pink is sick
[02:50:05] Luffy
[02:50:07] as a jeweler cherishes their gems
[02:50:10] because French people wear hats
[02:50:15] she's from Inazuma
[02:50:20] ayaka's travel outfit it's designed as
[02:50:21] based on fonten oh
[02:50:25] okay well I hate French detier
[02:50:28] no I'm kidding I died
[02:50:32] uh it's probably I thought no I'm uh
[02:50:35] it's based on live novel okay uh
[02:50:39] f110
[02:50:46] foreign
[02:50:53] it's cool but the boots tilt me and then
[02:50:56] a lot of people don't like the Hat
[02:50:57] personally it's no it hasn't grown I
[02:50:59] mean it has grown on me but I it's like
[02:51:01] killer cherishes there I like it from
[02:51:03] the front I don't like it from the back
[02:51:04] does that make sense I like that like
[02:51:06] like here looks cute here it's like what
[02:51:08] the [ __ ] am I looking at
[02:51:09] it's I it's I A lot of people are saying
[02:51:12] a tier I think you're dumb I think it's
[02:51:13] like B it's all right I mean it's not
[02:51:16] it's not no it's not on the same level
[02:51:17] as the Barbara ducky
[02:51:22] I'm putting it there [ __ ] you that's my
[02:51:24] opinion
[02:51:25] you could disagree with me I think it's
[02:51:27] there
[02:51:30] I think it's like
[02:51:33] no jeans
[02:51:39] I think the hair is a lot better but I
[02:51:42] don't uh
[02:51:43] I didn't even see it braces it's Duty
[02:51:50] wait let me see let me let me put it in
[02:51:54] let me let me put skin characters in the
[02:51:56] team there's another one where's ning
[02:51:58] Wong
[02:52:04] how's your to be working with
[02:52:09] dude the Ning walks get is so good
[02:52:22] I think I could look like this looks
[02:52:25] good like this I mean the back is
[02:52:27] actually sick I just don't
[02:52:29] I mean I guess it grows on you
[02:52:32] yeah I think B3 is fair
[02:52:35] showcase them walking
[02:52:43] oh
[02:52:49] it's nothing
[02:53:05] even the little listen to The Sounds
[02:53:10] thank you
[02:53:11] you're just biased
[02:53:17] ning Wong's Loki my favorite skin though
[02:53:37] if only she wasn't Geo the leg tattoo
[02:53:42] yeah true actually
[02:53:46] yeah now let's get a stick
[02:53:59] stop
[02:54:02] all right
[02:54:06] I think if we're honest
[02:54:15] is this over saturated s
[02:54:17] Maybe
[02:54:19] foreign
[02:54:29] I
[02:54:32] kind of winged it but I don't know if
[02:54:34] they're actually ordered uh
[02:54:40] we should prepare while we can official
[02:54:43] hey no I like officials a lot like
[02:54:44] against the enemy
[02:54:51] I think this makes sense
[02:54:59] the kaching's killing me okay originally
[02:55:01] we had this but I feel like
[02:55:04] I feel like kachings
[02:55:05] so the thing is I think Cleese is better
[02:55:07] than kachings
[02:55:09] actually no that's not true I think
[02:55:10] Fishel is better than kaching and I
[02:55:12] don't think they're both S I mean maybe
[02:55:14] but then we do this that looks weird
[02:55:35] foreign
[02:55:38] skin I don't even like Rosario's default
[02:55:40] I think both Rosario skins look bad I
[02:55:43] think Rosario could be done better
[02:55:59] let's take a moment to rest and plan our
[02:56:02] next move if there is an SS tier I would
[02:56:04] probably put
[02:56:06] S I think my favorite and then I think
[02:56:08] the loot because you get animations and
[02:56:09] voice lines and sound effects and it
[02:56:12] fixes his hair and it fixes his drip has
[02:56:14] to be there and then Lisa Kaya official
[02:56:17] and then
[02:56:19] I don't know there's a case where
[02:56:21] kaching being here there's a case for
[02:56:22] clear I can't really I don't know I
[02:56:24] think this is I think this is that
[02:56:29] we do a
[02:56:40] uh
[02:56:42] every course of action has its risks
[02:56:46] careful
[02:56:49] you're like Kyle would be second place
[02:56:51] for me okay if I'm adding personal bias
[02:56:53] too like obviously there's already bias
[02:56:55] that I can't remove but like personal
[02:56:58] bias on top of it I [ __ ] love Kaya's
[02:57:00] because there's a bunch of random like
[02:57:02] he just does a bunch of random Skin
[02:57:03] showing plus he has a dagger here and
[02:57:06] like a [ __ ] like feathery scarf I
[02:57:09] think it looks [ __ ] sick I would put
[02:57:10] it higher but like I also think
[02:57:13] objectively I don't think it's that much
[02:57:15] higher than like please so like I can't
[02:57:17] put it like I don't know I mean it's
[02:57:19] still high
[02:57:26] oh
[02:57:28] if you move Kaya I'm unsubbing
[02:57:40] but yeah
[02:57:42] this is my take so far
[02:57:44] we'll see if it changes
[02:57:50] if you push Jean Summer Skin to Al sub
[02:57:53] my reasoning was just that she already
[02:57:54] has a good one that's free
[02:57:57] that was my only reasoning I think it's
[02:57:59] interchangeable look where's my Gene my
[02:58:01] Gene is on that skin right now
[02:58:07] see she's on that skin I just think it's
[02:58:09] interchangeable with this one and this
[02:58:11] one's free which is why this one's and
[02:58:13] this one's B but I think it's also High
[02:58:14] B I think they're interchangeable
[02:58:22] and yeah this default zone is kind of
[02:58:24] sick
[02:58:37] yeah I think that's the best of the like
[02:58:39] alternative ones she gave
[02:58:41] I mean we got
[02:58:44] in the name of
[02:58:46] in the name of
[02:58:51] why didn't I said my Gene what the [ __ ]
[02:58:52] with it
[02:58:58] here
[02:58:59] jeans censored skin it doesn't matter if
[02:59:01] it's censored that leaves more to the
[02:59:03] imagination chat come on think about it
[02:59:07] the respectful outfits are better
[02:59:10] thank you
[02:59:11] okay sorry
[02:59:15] dude an outfit doesn't have to show
[02:59:17] their entire entire [ __ ] skin to be
[02:59:20] good
[02:59:20] I think it'd be covered up
[02:59:24] anyways that's it that's the definitive
[02:59:26] ranking
[02:59:29] maybe subject to change if I add SS it
[02:59:33] looks more even like if I add SS and
[02:59:35] then I split these it looks more even
[02:59:38] less like top heavy but it's fine
[02:59:45] a post on Twitter
[02:59:49] uh I don't know about that one
[03:00:00] dude distribution okay sure but here
[03:00:03] okay here's the thing with a skin tier
[03:00:05] list if every skin is good that doesn't
[03:00:07] make no skin good so like let's say
[03:00:10] you're doing like a meta tourist right
[03:00:13] if every character is s tier that's like
[03:00:15] weird because then it's like all
[03:00:16] characters are as good as each other but
[03:00:18] skins can all look good independently
[03:00:20] they don't influence each other
[03:00:23] wait what the [ __ ] is that
[03:00:29] wow
[03:00:37] like if they release 10s to your skins
[03:00:39] in a row that doesn't make that doesn't
[03:00:41] make it
[03:00:42] they'll still all be asked here
[03:00:52] this guy's immune to enema on installing
[03:00:57] he's a noon
[03:00:59] well DPS could call me I guess
[03:01:13] push two characters you hope get a skin
[03:01:15] next give me a Reaper Xiao and
[03:01:23] I like them
[03:01:28] actually no I'll have them skin would
[03:01:29] even be better than this original
[03:01:30] realistically
[03:01:32] so give me uh
[03:01:38] our outfits would be sick actually
[03:01:47] yeah give me all the archon fits
[03:01:58] get out of my way give me the Zhang Li
[03:02:01] one with a hoodie
[03:02:09] and then
[03:02:11] kill nahida and release greater Lord
[03:02:13] Ruka Nevada instead
[03:02:21] dude why is he immune to Nemo
[03:02:30] actually taking a year
[03:02:33] me
[03:02:45] please
[03:03:05] what is happening we are doing a bounty
[03:03:07] where he's immune to enema and I didn't
[03:03:09] know so we are playing physical Xiao
[03:03:14] what do you think of this combo so you
[03:03:15] could do charge attack jump backwards
[03:03:17] boom boom physical plunge
[03:03:20] pretty good pretty good
[03:03:23] wait we're our resident hey
[03:03:37] it's gonna be captain

[03:03:44] geared for that right now

[03:04:22] oh this could be good okay well I'll do
[03:04:25] another because I have to uncap it
[03:04:28] it's fine it's still one resident it's
[03:04:29] still only one resin

[03:07:39] foreign
[03:07:46] one two three four five six seven eight
[03:07:50] nine
[03:07:52] ten eleven twelve
[03:07:56] thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen
[03:08:07] [ __ ] it
[03:08:10] anything for content
[03:08:13] no matter the silly rolls crit
[03:08:17] Captain Man
[03:08:40] okay well
[03:08:42] well your favorite team again Shin I
[03:08:44] really like taser teams or like the
[03:08:46] dentro equivalent so like I guess Dedra
[03:08:49] kind of changed which teams I like but
[03:08:50] before deadro's taser
[03:08:53] which is just electrocharged
[03:08:57] uh with dental
[03:09:00] I also like reverse enough clothes oh
[03:09:02] yeah I like 16 18 it's fun
[03:09:04] with dendro I also like
[03:09:07] um
[03:09:09] I don't know actually what
[03:09:16] uh I think aggravates pretty fun
[03:09:21] hyperboom is fun but it's like too meta
[03:09:24] that it becomes boring because I'm
[03:09:25] always playing it
[03:09:27] I think virgin is sick I wish virgin was
[03:09:29] good if virgin was like a bit better or
[03:09:31] we had better virgin units like if Daya
[03:09:33] was a character version by maybe if it
[03:09:35] might be my favorite
[03:09:38] um
[03:09:47] I like soup or like um the [ __ ] is salad
[03:09:51] which is basically taser but with dendro
[03:10:04] I agree it's feathers I fear death row
[03:10:06] yeah cookie dupes so quicker themes are
[03:10:08] really fun but quicker themes usually
[03:10:10] for me end up being hyperloom because
[03:10:12] I'm just like ah might as well put yalon
[03:10:13] here and then it just it's like quick
[03:10:15] bloom
[03:10:18] foreign
[03:10:48] Okay so
[03:10:50] last stream
[03:10:52] we found out that I spent
[03:10:56] virtually a 100K resin
[03:11:00] in
[03:11:02] vermili 2500 ruin graders would be
[03:11:05] exactly a hundred thousand resin but
[03:11:08] there's a few variables I might have
[03:11:09] killed like 20 or so while exploring
[03:11:11] Dragon spine I might have killed maybe
[03:11:13] another 10 20 in The Abyss whenever
[03:11:16] there's a rune grader like the one or
[03:11:17] two times
[03:11:19] variables so what we're going to do is
[03:11:21] we're not only going to hit 2500 I think
[03:11:23] maybe we should hit 2600. we should just
[03:11:26] go a bit higher just to make sure that
[03:11:28] we've actually spent a hundred thousand
[03:11:30] resin in Vermillion and then proceed to
[03:11:32] make a video on it I think is what we
[03:11:34] should do
[03:11:35] but that's just my thinking
[03:11:39] round It Off
[03:11:41] round it up a little bit more Vermillion
[03:11:44] maybe two five fifty
[03:11:50] and then see if we really wasted resin
[03:11:53] or if we gained
[03:11:55] bezen that's not a word
[03:11:57] what arrives with the resin
[03:11:59] yeah okay I have resin
[03:12:04] okay
[03:12:06] squish you like a raisin that's not
[03:12:10] nothing rhymes with the resin
[03:12:17] depression
[03:12:22] I mean this isn't really rhyme but okay
[03:12:41] all right let's do a bit more
[03:12:51] am I just a live stream but I don't know
[03:12:54] I'd rather stream it if I can
[03:12:58] no don't Farm Vermillion just don't if
[03:13:01] anything wait till it's in the [ __ ]
[03:13:03] strong box and if it isn't then
[03:13:04] uninstall
[03:13:14] the desert set is objectively better you
[03:13:16] are objectively dumb
[03:13:18] the desert set is not objectively better
[03:13:22] can you listen to cocodiles it is
[03:13:24] comparable at best
[03:13:27] oh
[03:13:31] oh maybe hey hey maybe maybe through
[03:13:36] struggle we find success
[03:13:42] maybe through the grind we are bind
[03:13:48] what I don't know let's level it
[03:14:09] what's up
[03:14:23] sorry I was uh linking the kayak guide
[03:14:26] to okay all right let's roll it
[03:14:31] oh where it will become a hotel piece
[03:14:34] [ __ ] you don't even manifest that energy
[03:14:36] around me
[03:14:45] dude are flowers like one of our worst
[03:14:48] pieces outside of like goblet so
[03:14:52] this could be uh
[03:14:54] interesting this could be interesting
[03:15:00] narwhals swim there's a prime
[03:15:17] that's a literal
[03:15:19] but
[03:15:21] much like my standards
[03:15:24] and my hopes and aspirations
[03:15:27] this role was low
[03:15:40] well I guess it was 3.1 that's true
[03:15:50] but the average of two being 5.8 Hertz
[03:15:58] [ __ ] it I don't even care anymore
[03:16:00] I don't care anymore
[03:16:39] foreign
[03:16:57] wait surely okay yo chat surely I don't
[03:16:59] need three dendro goblets on Crimson
[03:17:01] right surely I don't need to keep all
[03:17:03] three
[03:17:11] yes you do
[03:17:16] was there no piece I can throw

[03:18:10] Hotel
[03:18:14] yeah okay no thank you
[03:18:25] oh it's because it's hotel's birthday so

[03:18:35] makes sense
[03:18:37] happy birthday without also I'm not
[03:18:39] getting any friendship on this team so
[03:18:41] let me change teams I'll do a normal run

[03:19:28] eventually though
[03:19:36] mid how the [ __ ] is my hotel mid
[03:19:39] honestly I'm gonna say it might that was
[03:19:42] better than your hotel chat it could be
[03:19:43] mid but it's better than yours
[03:19:45] well I just couldn't wait control tab to
[03:19:47] return to game what the [ __ ] did I do

[03:20:01] goblet so it looks like I have VM you
[03:20:03] think it's at my actual goblet this is
[03:20:05] the actual goblet and it's on
[03:20:06] reminiscence
[03:20:10] [ __ ] you we're crit value Andy's now now
[03:20:12] what
[03:20:14] also that's not even a right feather I

[03:20:18] feather
[03:20:22] now what 82-34
[03:20:27] and we can just go em Sans
[03:20:30] but I don't have a crystal which one
[03:20:33] which is why I was using the actual
[03:20:34] goblet which is better
[03:20:36] [Music]
[03:20:42] cheers
[03:20:48] okay sorry unnecessary
[03:20:59] oh
[03:21:16] wait my mouse
[03:21:18] the [ __ ] happened to my mouse
[03:21:21] but for the skin team well I actually
[03:21:23] need a friendship team though who needs
[03:21:25] friendship
[03:21:35] me
[03:21:42] yeah the only problem with our hotel is
[03:21:43] you don't have a em stands on Crimson so
[03:21:45] my best guitar builds unironically
[03:21:47] reminiscence because I can go offset
[03:21:49] because I have the on the Goblet right
[03:21:51] because em stands whenever you Cal here
[03:21:53] who tells damage the absence always
[03:21:55] ranks way [ __ ] higher
[03:21:56] because of a bunch of cringe stupid dog
[03:21:58] [ __ ] variables so I'd have to go like uh
[03:22:02] look good I have to do this
[03:22:09] dude look at my look wait wait wait
[03:22:11] actually though
[03:22:13] balls where is it look at my
[03:22:15] deathmatcher towel you're gonna ain't no
[03:22:18] way it but unironically look
[03:22:26] uh uh is it the Sun
[03:22:34] it was HP on it
[03:22:38] and ironically look away that's actually
[03:22:40] it's actually pretty good for Deathmatch
[03:22:43] because yeah dude 32kh should be on a
[03:22:46] death match it's actually not bad
[03:22:49] okay
[03:22:51] uh we're gonna break some people for
[03:22:53] friendship we'll bring kiraro we'll play
[03:22:55] aggravate again
[03:23:00] I can't wait any longer actually in
[03:23:04] there
[03:23:05] [ __ ] hopefully shangling
[03:23:08] what if we play burning
[03:23:09] I believe this won't take long
[03:23:13] foot burning
[03:23:19] wow this ought to be entertaining
[03:23:30] did no one needs friendship anymore
[03:23:33] I'm Eloy ready for the hunt I'm Eloy
[03:23:39] ah
[03:23:42] I don't know I'll just pick a thing I
[03:23:44] guess whatever
[03:23:49] I like turtle this is 22 months kamehame
[03:23:55] thank you
[03:23:56] also did quick movement hyperbloom one
[03:23:58] is quick one as hyper you're welcome
[03:23:59] bipolar uh tomorrow
[03:24:04] hi how was a date to win that's pretty
[03:24:07] good except my neck hurt and then I dead
[03:24:08] lifted for no reason it's not hers more
[03:24:15] all I wanted was a go-row guide and he's
[03:24:17] now
[03:24:18] after a year oh where where I made a
[03:24:22] Goro guide though
[03:24:24] am I making a turn Oh you mean you
[03:24:26] stayed oh
[03:24:30] you came for Goro but stayed for me
[03:24:32] while I was asking truly an amazing
[03:24:34] person
[03:24:42] okay
[03:24:55] okay
[03:24:57] well this could be good actually
[03:24:59] the four stars unlucky
[03:25:03] average the Jeff team be out ironically
[03:25:06] but he'd be playing like [ __ ] Razer
[03:25:08] in here
[03:25:10] foreign
[03:25:12] [Music]
[03:25:47] hey
[03:25:58] the driver play everyone on five dude
[03:26:00] five like we joke about him using Fab on
[03:26:03] everything but he unironically uses Fab
[03:26:05] al-haitham
[03:26:09] dude who the [ __ ] plays fav I'll hide
[03:26:11] them
[03:26:27] it's good okay but think about it if
[03:26:30] you're playing family that means that
[03:26:32] none of the characters in your team meet
[03:26:34] their energy requirements on your normal
[03:26:36] build of them so unless you have like a
[03:26:38] bunch of different builds why do none of
[03:26:40] your characters have enough ER stop
[03:26:41] Band-Aid fixing by running fav on your
[03:26:44] main DPS like fabulon sure fav whoever
[03:26:48] else is in your team like kooky sure why
[03:26:50] the [ __ ] is it on your item
[03:26:54] laughs
[03:26:59] it's not bad it's not bad on him but
[03:27:01] it's like why are you doing that
[03:27:04] yeah
[03:27:07] taking a turn for the better
[03:27:15] I don't know where to hide
[03:27:21] Yolanda does more damage maybe single
[03:27:24] Target but I like them plus this
[03:27:25] reaction average is really high but
[03:27:27] that's not the point the point is the
[03:27:28] opportunity cost what does Jalan lose by
[03:27:31] running a low base stack ER weapon
[03:27:33] [ __ ] nothing because she scales on
[03:27:34] she needs a tremendous amount of ER and
[03:27:36] skills on HP not attack so she's not
[03:27:38] losing as much as uh I'll hide them
[03:27:41] especially because the item typically
[03:27:42] won't need the 61 ER or however the [ __ ]
[03:27:45] matcha gives you
[03:27:47] foreign
[03:28:00] why do you guys type nerd when I answer
[03:28:02] a question
[03:28:23] uh how do I avoid burning oh [ __ ] it we
[03:28:26] don't avoid burning
[03:28:29] remember help comes first
[03:28:33] sword comes
[03:28:36] down speed of light
[03:28:42] dude if I don't answer a question you
[03:28:45] say guide maker by the way and if I do
[03:28:48] you say nerd how do I win
[03:29:05] wow so we are actually definitely
[03:29:07] wasting our resin
[03:29:09] should be doing gilded
[03:29:11] I actually really need a gilded Sands
[03:29:13] because if I get a gilded sensor I'll
[03:29:14] hide them because the offset Goblin and
[03:29:16] then scream in a while and it seems he's
[03:29:19] farming a completely new domain finally
[03:29:21] [ __ ] you oh I actually go to gilded and
[03:29:24] forget about peace here I'm not even
[03:29:25] kidding

[03:31:39] [ __ ] monitor just turned off what
[03:31:41] happened do you guys see that I couldn't

[03:31:50] all right let's go to gilded I'm
[03:31:52] responsible
[03:32:04] [Music]
[03:32:06] oh
[03:32:08] okay we need to play Kaya skin so we'll
[03:32:11] make this team even more uh scuffed and
[03:32:13] we'll do this oh wow truly a team
[03:32:20] surely no one's thought of this team
[03:32:22] before
[03:32:33] that's the team I play there's no way
[03:32:35] anyone's played this
[03:32:38] broke taking the turn for the better
[03:32:44] look at all the colorful reactions
[03:32:58] freeze a bitter purpose
[03:33:04] every time we use an ability we proc a
[03:33:06] different reaction
[03:33:08] nice
[03:33:21] you probably got blade Islands or like
[03:33:23] code I don't know yet maybe light code
[03:33:26] I haven't thought about HSR for a little
[03:33:27] bit I need to get back into it
[03:33:29] like decide on who I'm gonna pull and
[03:33:31] [ __ ] or what I'm gonna pull I'm
[03:33:33] definitely getting blade Kafka though
[03:33:38] who's getting the Gilling piece a guilty
[03:33:39] piece it all we get but my main goal is
[03:33:42] that's how high them because I'm using
[03:33:44] an offset Sans
[03:33:46] and I'd rather use offset goblet
[03:33:50] here remember health comes first
[03:33:54] blade
[03:34:12] do those aromites are either super easy
[03:34:15] do you kill them instantly or super
[03:34:16] [ __ ] annoying and they just knock you
[03:34:18] everywhere
[03:34:26] this looks cool but it could be good
[03:34:28] ironically
[03:34:33] income
[03:34:47] the [ __ ] did I just how did I open the
[03:34:48] map
[03:34:53] what am I doing freeze wait let me get
[03:34:56] let me get Chinese verse back we'll do
[03:34:57] optimal rotation
[03:34:59] I don't think I do
[03:35:02] okay watch this
[03:35:04] there's the reverse mouth then we could
[03:35:07] change baiju that's not baiju baiju
[03:35:17] ice
[03:35:25] that was fun and Interactive
[03:35:29] here takes some good artists oh thank
[03:35:31] you for the good artifact s oh
[03:35:41] I got scammed
[03:35:46] my favorite team rainbow this team is
[03:35:49] actually uh
[03:35:52] super over
[03:35:55] burning conduct
[03:35:57] but also fridge
[03:35:59] super over burning conductor fridge
[03:36:10] that's that's my favorite team
[03:36:14] I love that team golf
[03:36:16] it don't blink
[03:36:19] themselves really cooked up a team
[03:36:31] what is Cushing sound like that

[03:37:48] be cringe like that doesn't happen often
[03:37:49] sometimes it does but it's very rare

[03:38:10] what's the hurry
[03:38:19] no no this is the classic super
[03:38:26] over conduct

[03:40:32] get me out of here man
[03:40:47] switch to Star rail stereo for me is
[03:40:49] also brain numbing

[03:42:49] even if I get Abyss footage I can't use
[03:42:51] it anywhere
[03:42:55] Chad surely the next Abyss has to be
[03:42:58] easier and more fun right because this
[03:43:00] Abyss was actually like
[03:43:04] traumatizing
[03:43:09] surely right
[03:43:12] surely we're gonna first try it
[03:43:21] they can't sell Eula and Cleve they
[03:43:23] don't make an easy Abyss dude Ryan when
[03:43:26] Ryan first came out her Abyss was
[03:43:29] high tide low tide energy mechanic that
[03:43:32] made her like six times worse than
[03:43:33] normal
[03:43:43] for no reason
[03:43:47] you are the most zox ziox ever shukron
[03:43:50] Habibi

[03:43:58] drops a year one year in one year I
[03:44:01] could have learned a new language sure
[03:44:03] made new friends
[03:44:05] become rich out of the world but
[03:44:08] unfortunately I chose to subscribe to
[03:44:10] Zaya
[03:44:12] you could still do all of those things
[03:44:14] at the same time ban me from the stream
[03:44:17] please I'm not bad at you
[03:44:25] what
[03:44:30] Chad which is the best event

[03:45:34] Abyss when you end up going back to
[03:45:36] finishing abysses within 30 minutes
[03:45:41] true actually not true [ __ ] this Abyss I
[03:45:44] mean I appreciate the difficulty but it
[03:45:46] was just it did it's annoying as [ __ ]

[04:33:19] so next to this is in what a day and
[04:33:21] like 14 minutes
[04:33:24] so I could stream it super late at night
[04:33:27] tomorrow but realistically I'll do it
[04:33:30] in two days like instead of doing
[04:33:31] tomorrow I'll stream the next day but
[04:33:33] early probably
[04:33:35] um but I also want to stream star rails
[04:33:37] I don't know I'll figure it out but
[04:33:39] Abyss will be next
[04:33:41] yeah
[04:33:43] we'll be around then
[04:33:52] you think about battle guide out though
[04:33:54] before the [ __ ] because it's already
[04:33:55] edited I just need to like review it so
[04:33:57] that'll be out tomorrow probably

[04:34:02] tomorrow or early the day after for
[04:34:04] Abyss
