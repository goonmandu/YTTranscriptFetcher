[00:19:23] chat I want to check chat can I check
[00:19:24] can I click on the chat window
[00:19:27] my click
[00:19:31] guide maker by the way
[00:19:35] yeah before I reach out before I reach
[00:19:37] out before I reach out let me tell you
[00:19:39] the characters it could be I know it's a
[00:19:41] monster character but I don't know what
[00:19:42] they sound like so it's either
[00:19:44] it's either Eula diona or Noel or
[00:19:48] there's another
[00:19:54] yeah it's either Eula Diana or no but
[00:19:56] how I don't think it's Eula I don't
[00:19:58] think it's any of them
[00:20:02] oh it is not wait is it actually Noel
[00:20:04] dude why would no okay but I told you
[00:20:06] guys it could be I literally I literally
[00:20:08] you know I said this you know one of my
[00:20:10] first guesses was it could be Noel but I
[00:20:12] don't know what she sounds like why
[00:20:13] would you expect me to know what she
[00:20:14] sounds like why give me one good reason
[00:20:16] give me one good reason to know what
[00:20:18] Noel sounds like if I knew what she
[00:20:20] sounded like it would be more concerning
[00:20:21] because why am I playing the game like
[00:20:23] why am I launching engine off stream to
[00:20:25] play Noel what am I like are you okay
[00:20:28] so that would be weird that would be
[00:20:30] weird
[00:20:31] it would be weird if I knew it
[00:20:34] also why is it why is the Geo character
[00:20:37] being like I like the Animo archon
[00:20:41] capability
[00:20:43] what the [ __ ] is this like
[00:20:46] wait let me close shot
[00:20:48] looks like that's not John Lee's
[00:20:50] meatball but it looks like it but I know
[00:20:51] it's not it looks like raindrops what
[00:20:53] the [ __ ] is this
[00:20:55] what the [ __ ] is this
[00:20:58] ah
[00:21:02] okay I think it's a passive tolerant I
[00:21:04] don't think that's Zhang Lee I'm gonna
[00:21:06] guess wrongly just in case but I don't
[00:21:07] think it
[00:21:09] oh
[00:21:15] I mean I knew it I knew it but it looked
[00:21:18] because I thought it was like
[00:21:22] because I initially okay because my
[00:21:24] brain is more advanced think about it so
[00:21:26] I'm calling you guys uh uh uh uh Primal
[00:21:29] in terms of brain uh brain stage because
[00:21:32] look okay I saw this was like oh Jean
[00:21:35] Lee meteor but then I went a step
[00:21:36] further I didn't stop there that's where
[00:21:38] chat stopped I was like but wait a
[00:21:40] second if I rotate this and it's like
[00:21:42] this right what if this is like an
[00:21:44] electrical like you see how these looks
[00:21:45] like raindrops going to the ground so I
[00:21:47] assume that have to be this way because
[00:21:48] it's raindrops so if it's going down
[00:21:50] this isn't John Lee this could be like a
[00:21:53] Electro like let's say that we just like
[00:21:54] boom sudden
[00:21:59] suddenly this looks like a ryden's
[00:22:00] ability like this could be like Lisa
[00:22:05] whatever I
[00:22:06] but I still got it in one guess so I
[00:22:08] know what you guys are flaming me I
[00:22:09] literally got it in one guess there is
[00:22:11] no reason for you guys to Flame me I
[00:22:12] just was anticipating a possibility a
[00:22:16] world where it wasn't that that's all
[00:22:20] foreign
[00:22:24] it looks plus zero
[00:22:32] we'll do an endless to prove my
[00:22:33] intellect
[00:22:34] quick endless quick endless
[00:22:36] quick endless quick quick all right we
[00:22:38] got it leeway pyro yenfei GG I win no I
[00:22:42] clicked it
[00:22:46] I said
[00:22:48] okay but I clicked the unfair like I

[00:25:07] which is really good on this
[00:25:08] I also got the same thing level three
[00:25:11] and then I I I I I leveled it to three
[00:25:13] and it got speed it's not an order like
[00:25:16] gentian
[00:25:17] uh because I remember speed was when I
[00:25:20] got at level three I don't know why it
[00:25:21] shows like that's not true but I promise
[00:25:22] that's true so I think it's a thing with
[00:25:24] this game where it organized the stuff
[00:25:25] so I don't know but I know I got speed
[00:25:27] it didn't have speed at the start so
[00:25:29] literally perfect speed crit crit
[00:25:33] also if that wasn't enough and I know
[00:25:35] it's not enough
[00:25:37] let me elaborate I also got an ER rope
[00:25:40] but I don't remember on which set I just
[00:25:42] remember getting an ER rope which is a
[00:25:43] very big deal uh uh so let's look at
[00:25:45] that very quickly let's look at that
[00:25:47] very quickly uh we got one on the inert
[00:25:50] South Soto we also got one on the uh
[00:25:53] space stealing station which is great
[00:25:54] for space Steelers so yep that is what
[00:25:58] it is
[00:26:00] also
[00:26:02] now that's not all if that was all haha
[00:26:05] you would laugh at me that's not all we
[00:26:07] also got well um um um
[00:26:10] um
[00:26:11] um
[00:26:12] this which we rolled on stream it is
[00:26:13] what it is no big deal no big deal no
[00:26:15] big deal
[00:26:16] um I also got a lot of pieces that I
[00:26:18] locked but did not [ __ ] so for example
[00:26:21] uh for example we got
[00:26:24] um
[00:26:25] what's a good example
[00:26:27] I don't know but I know I have a lot of
[00:26:29] good pieces that we want to level
[00:26:30] so we'll do that together oh my God
[00:26:32] together
[00:26:33] sorry
[00:26:35] I didn't have to travel though like I'm
[00:26:37] excited but I'm gonna miss you guys
[00:26:38] there's so much [ __ ] content to do oh
[00:26:39] yeah I got it oh yeah I got these
[00:26:42] yeah so I just wanted to say that I've
[00:26:46] been watching your stream for a long
[00:26:48] time and dude I got both of his feet I'm
[00:26:50] currently watching with my friend boom
[00:26:52] and I think he's really cute now granted
[00:26:55] I kind of don't like the healing set and
[00:26:56] I would rather go
[00:26:58] um like this and go for some speed but
[00:27:00] since he doesn't really have like his
[00:27:01] own set I think we're just gonna do two
[00:27:03] piece two piece go sub stats
[00:27:05] or
[00:27:10] I don't know I mean speed boots with
[00:27:12] good crits of stats we just dude like a
[00:27:15] lot of characters what if we go two
[00:27:16] percent healing bonus on luocha no sorry
[00:27:19] on uh Jin Yuan because then we go
[00:27:20] genuine okay listen hear me out so
[00:27:22] genuine has two piece two-piece
[00:27:24] lightning two B's nothing but sub stats
[00:27:27] true real so we're gonna level these
[00:27:29] actually
[00:27:30] let me post through it yo uh bite size
[00:27:34] three the rain maybe this is the four
[00:27:36] months
[00:27:37] ready there's the nine months I'm about
[00:27:40] to the fourth oh [ __ ]
[00:27:43] hope your stream went well
[00:27:48] okay never mind all right
[00:27:51] let's pull for the ultra
[00:27:54] wait actually yeah no I'm ready oh I was
[00:27:56] gonna send my like home but I said I'll
[00:27:57] do it on stream so
[00:28:03] oh that's nothing but we had no credits
[00:28:06] we now have 2.7 million I know it's not
[00:28:08] enough but we still have the battle pass
[00:28:09] so uh fear not my uh uh compatriots also
[00:28:12] furthermore if that wasn't enough and it
[00:28:14] isn't enough I also leveled some like
[00:28:16] cones I got 217 of these 625 of these
[00:28:18] 132 of this one so we can Ascend uh the
[00:28:22] imaginary characters I got 41 of these
[00:28:24] for Dan hung I got this for bailu I got
[00:28:26] [ __ ] 58 hunt 56 hunt eight hunt guess
[00:28:29] what I thought UConn was erudition I
[00:28:32] don't know why so then I stopped farming
[00:28:34] it and I did some Harmony booby or
[00:28:35] Harmony and I got some abundance
[00:28:39] so I actually like yeah
[00:28:42] I did pre-farm now my question to you
[00:28:44] friends is which abundance weapon am I
[00:28:47] leveling uh because I need two anyways
[00:28:48] but I'm thinking I'm just loving the
[00:28:50] five star one because it's a five star
[00:28:51] and my brain likes to see gold
[00:28:53] and it gives you healing so
[00:29:02] granted we don't need the extra healing
[00:29:03] because I'm a giga Chad but
[00:29:10] I think we'll use this on like Natalia
[00:29:12] oh no we have bite we're gonna have
[00:29:14] three healers so we're probably not even
[00:29:15] gonna
[00:29:35] pull for like ah yeah I'm gonna pull for
[00:29:38] a healer's leg cone
[00:29:40] yeah you've earned the wrong [ __ ]
[00:29:42] stream you're in the wrong [ __ ]
[00:29:43] stream if you think I'm pulling for a
[00:29:45] healer's like don't I don't care if it's
[00:29:46] meta I don't care if if anyone tells you
[00:29:49] to do it are you think you got me [ __ ]
[00:29:50] up if you think I'm pulling for yeah for
[00:29:52] [ __ ] coconi's donut
[00:29:57] you got me [ __ ] up
[00:30:05] uh is attack scaling and this is a [ __ ]
[00:30:08] ton of healing so we'll probably get
[00:30:09] this like bailu or Natasha and then
[00:30:11] we'll give The Witcher one that's but it
[00:30:13] also has high base attack
[00:30:15] but still probably just do that and then
[00:30:17] but I don't feel like leveling another
[00:30:18] icon right now so I think we're just
[00:30:20] gonna level this one to 80 and then
[00:30:21] eventually we'll level another
[00:30:24] um
[00:30:26] maybe perfect timing effectres
[00:30:29] yeah effector is a nice what does this
[00:30:32] do yeah
[00:30:34] I mean it's not bad either all right
[00:30:36] bailu uses her signature luoka uses
[00:30:39] quick probably
[00:30:41] you're a quid
[00:30:46] sorry oh yeah you can't hold down wait
[00:30:48] can you no you can't
[00:30:58] pump
[00:31:02] 50 [ __ ] quid buff 50 [ __ ] pants
[00:31:06] okay we'll use this on him for now and
[00:31:07] then later we'll use a like we'll give
[00:31:09] this to Baidu I think I just don't have
[00:31:10] enough wait I do have enough I can
[00:31:11] battle pass
[00:31:13] also I'm pulling after I get my gear
[00:31:15] ready because then if I pull and then
[00:31:17] gear you guys are gonna like badge but
[00:31:18] if I if I gear and then pull there's
[00:31:20] gonna be hype does that make sense yes
[00:31:21] that makes sense thanks Alex no problem
[00:31:24] let me just clean the battle pass
[00:31:28] that [ __ ] looks like the battle pass
[00:31:32] Google show me this guy's balls okay we
[00:31:34] do this
[00:31:35] foreign
[00:31:42] err set okay maybe things have changed
[00:31:45] since the things that I looked into
[00:31:47] before you came out but in no [ __ ]
[00:31:49] world does a Healer who doesn't depend
[00:31:51] on his burst need that much ER I don't
[00:31:53] know maybe
[00:31:54] but I don't think so so far but maybe
[00:31:56] I'll change my mind throughout the
[00:31:57] throughout the live streaming process
[00:32:10] Max exp reach okay
[00:32:18] okay
[00:32:20] um
[00:32:21] wait what's even on the bet on the
[00:32:23] weapon man I didn't see that's that's
[00:32:24] pretty Paul good night also could be POG
[00:32:27] depending on who you're playing
[00:32:29] what does this one do
[00:32:32] well I've never seen this weapon
[00:32:35] okay yeah I mean copium
[00:32:39] well actually it's not bad never mind
[00:32:42] wait this is good actually no one
[00:32:44] okay yeah no I don't want it though wait
[00:32:47] let me reread the five star one
[00:32:52] wow yeah and no world
[00:32:55] all right
[00:32:57] ready
[00:33:00] also I'm waiting like yeah
[00:33:03] I want to wait till I can I fully clear
[00:33:05] like memory of chaos and stuff because
[00:33:07] uh
[00:33:09] yeah a lot of the like things that I
[00:33:11] know are gonna be really useful and good
[00:33:12] late game haven't been very useful or
[00:33:15] good like aren't needed so far so I
[00:33:16] wonder if like like the last floor or
[00:33:18] something will be like yeah we'll see
[00:33:21] as Father's Day months
[00:33:28] wait we need more music or different
[00:33:30] music uh I'm not gonna play something
[00:33:32] for the vodkas Gamba where I might put
[00:33:35] something over but we could play it for
[00:33:37] stream friends we could play like
[00:33:40] where's megalovania
[00:33:45] control F Mega
[00:33:49] all right cool
[00:33:51] all right let me check my pity I know we

[00:33:57] weren't really it
[00:33:59] it was hard to get silver wolf it took a
[00:34:01] long time it took us like [ __ ]
[00:34:03] basically soft to hard pity twice like

[00:34:38] be drop hard or

[00:46:57] that oh thank God uses a mat that I
[00:46:59] actually have
[00:47:01] ah okay

[00:47:18] I'm using a skeletons
[00:47:24] okay cool
[00:47:27] let's do stocks
[00:47:33] so one stack of visible flower here one
[00:47:35] stack of the Bissell flower here
[00:47:38] and then when you gain two stacks you
[00:47:40] deploy a field that has a cooldown of
[00:47:43] it doesn't say cooldown
[00:47:44] but it just says that last two turns
[00:47:50] and then you normal attack for technique
[00:47:51] points poggers or skill points rather
[00:47:55] all right cool let's level them
[00:48:04] how is megalovania still playing
[00:48:08] I didn't mean to Loop it
[00:48:19] dude look how much I pre-farmed
[00:48:21] literally no way we run out of mats
[00:48:36] why are you guys stopping clueless
[00:48:37] there's literally no way
[00:48:39] wait what is this oh I can make these I
[00:48:41] can make this
[00:48:46] foreign
[00:48:51] color probably purple I like purple and
[00:48:54] black
[00:48:56] wait this is yo yo this is a lot do we
[00:49:00] just keep him 70 yo
[00:49:02] can we just give him 70 bro
[00:49:05] this is a lot of books man like I have
[00:49:08] enough I pre-farmed enough
[00:49:15] 75 for Trace oh I forgot that's a thing
[00:49:18] in this game wait which one
[00:49:23] Max HP
[00:49:25] this is Max HP
[00:49:28] attack
[00:49:37] yeah
[00:49:39] I'm down to I'm down to 80 him like I am
[00:49:42] down I [ __ ] love him but like
[00:49:44] yeah like it's I think it's fine to
[00:49:46] leave him there for now
[00:49:49] he might be squishy true he might be a
[00:49:51] little squishy because
[00:49:52] killing Healers don't stock HP so they
[00:49:54] might what the [ __ ]
[00:49:56] what
[00:49:59] it's massive coffins
[00:50:01] I was trying to talk
[00:50:07] he just whipped out of coffin
[00:50:11] goddamn
[00:50:14] um
[00:50:18] what the [ __ ] does Yukon do I genuinely
[00:50:20] have not read as like I know what Lucha
[00:50:22] does but I haven't read a single thing
[00:50:24] about her
[00:50:25] uh when her ultimate is used initially
[00:50:27] wait what if roaring both strings are
[00:50:29] active on Yukon when her ultimate is
[00:50:30] used additionally increases all allies
[00:50:32] criterate and crit damage
[00:50:36] okay how'd you get the bow string Twin
[00:50:39] Two stocks remembering active attack
[00:50:41] allies increased by 40 percent
[00:50:48] oh you lose the stack every time an ally
[00:50:50] turn ends though
[00:50:53] wait these Buffs look insane but I don't
[00:50:55] know what the uptime is wait because you
[00:50:57] lose one track whenever an ally turn
[00:50:58] ends we don't have to wait is there
[00:51:00] other talents wait let me look
[00:51:02] what does this do
[00:51:03] okay
[00:51:05] sure
[00:51:07] I mean cool
[00:51:10] does this even matter it's like wow welt
[00:51:12] okay
[00:51:16] you need to speed tune yeah yeah for
[00:51:19] sure
[00:51:20] that means use a lot of skill points on
[00:51:22] her though no because if it if it's too
[00:51:24] late you know how many skill points are
[00:51:26] you using wait if if this okay if this
[00:51:29] lasts for two half like half a turn base
[00:51:32] if if a turn is four characters it's two
[00:51:34] characters I have it's what the [ __ ]
[00:51:36] wait
[00:51:40] it'll be fine though like this is really
[00:51:43] [ __ ] good though
[00:51:45] wait how long does this last active
[00:51:47] additionally increases all allies
[00:51:51] oh only for this wait
[00:52:08] okay uh I don't want to be a [ __ ] I'm
[00:52:11] not gonna say anything before I play her
[00:52:12] we'll see like the Buffs look insane but
[00:52:15] like if I could snapshot them like I
[00:52:17] swapped the shangling she pyro natos it
[00:52:19] snapshots the buff that's great but if
[00:52:21] not like the uptime looks kind of monkey
[00:52:23] so we'll see yeah maybe eidolon's help
[00:52:25] fix it uh speed is great
[00:52:29] that's good energy sure
[00:52:32] I mean this this is kind of useless but
[00:52:34] whatever
[00:52:36] oh that's good that's actually wait but
[00:52:38] one stock how do you get the second
[00:52:39] because it's Max two
[00:52:42] and you get two here
[00:52:43] oh wait what
[00:52:52] I don't get it
[00:52:56] it's fine
[00:52:58] whatever
[00:53:00] Lucha's ready Let's uh level everything
[00:53:03] you don't need two stacks to the crit
[00:53:05] buff oh
[00:53:07] wait is that true
[00:53:09] oh yeah true actually
[00:53:11] true
[00:53:13] okay it makes sense yeah makes sense
[00:53:16] you get a point after an ally gets a
[00:53:18] turn
[00:53:28] am I
[00:53:30] I mean like after one Ally goes you lose
[00:53:32] one
[00:53:36] the
[00:53:40] oh you got two on this too
[00:53:45] I don't think the trial
[00:53:47] will do that much
[00:53:49] but we can try it
[00:53:55] not Heist
[00:53:59] s
[00:54:21] okay see how this goes character
[00:54:25] introduction what the [ __ ] is this
[00:54:27] Spirit Never Dies
[00:54:31] um
[00:54:39] sorry I'll move my face cam
[00:54:42] is now we mustn't delay okay
[00:54:47] okay uh we'll just use our skill so
[00:54:50] yo okay what the [ __ ] is happening bro
[00:54:57] this was a conscious design decision why
[00:55:00] does
[00:55:02] why does it yo this was a conscious
[00:55:04] decision
[00:55:07] okay will you skill on um
[00:55:10] oh you can't oh yeah it's just two
[00:55:11] stacks yeah obviously
[00:55:14] cool
[00:55:17] so now it shows the stocks bottom left
[00:55:20] right yeah two
[00:55:22] the wind is rising
[00:55:27] loud kites formation from the
[00:55:35] problem that's too late to repent
[00:55:39] all right I like her uh okay well wait
[00:55:43] let's see okay let me so now one turn
[00:55:45] goes away now another turn goes away
[00:55:50] and how conveniently it's our turn again
[00:55:52] because we only have three characters
[00:55:55] but I guess so you probably okay let's
[00:55:58] say you're playing let's say you're
[00:55:59] playing like DPS character
[00:56:01] healer and then another like kind of sub
[00:56:04] DPS like [ __ ] Aster like a support
[00:56:06] that does damage wealth whatever right
[00:56:08] silver wolf you can kind of manage your
[00:56:11] speed to where green Ting Yoon Buffs
[00:56:14] your DPS and then your other DPS but not
[00:56:16] your healer so you make your healer
[00:56:18] slower
[00:56:19] and then it's fine if your only up time
[00:56:21] is two turns instead of three and then
[00:56:23] when you go back to her you skill again
[00:56:26] kind of
[00:56:30] uh
[00:56:38] yeah wait but did that get buffed
[00:56:41] all it doesn't count as a turn but it
[00:56:43] still gets [ __ ] right tread because it
[00:56:45] gets buff for those duration let's go so
[00:56:47] that's that's like yeah yeah that's
[00:56:48] workable around the ball
[00:56:50] I mean it might we'll see Wilson
[00:56:52] practice it's Still Point hungry but it
[00:56:53] looks workable aroundable fighting is
[00:56:55] meaning
[00:57:05] I have no interesting conflict
[00:57:09] the truth of Life yeah and see like the
[00:57:12] stack ends when you end your turn but if
[00:57:13] you all prefer it ends then the turn
[00:57:15] didn't end so the point didn't lose
[00:57:16] because the end didn't end so now we can
[00:57:18] do that so you can kind of get a bit
[00:57:20] more value in than you might like think
[00:57:22] if you're unga bungang which is cool
[00:57:32] foreign
[00:57:38] 's passive yeah
[00:57:40] but
[00:57:42] other characters can but yeah that's
[00:57:44] definitely something to note if you're a
[00:57:45] dad hung main if you're dead hungman you
[00:57:46] probably want to play
[00:57:48] someone else I guess your healer can but
[00:57:50] it's kind of scoffed if you like are
[00:57:52] forced to heal your dunhung to buff him
[00:58:05] oh what the [ __ ] is this
[00:58:09] okay cool we can do that later
[00:58:13] balls
[00:58:15] oh yeah megalovania is still playing I'm
[00:58:17] sorry [ __ ] let me
[00:58:19] uh we'll Shuffle
[00:58:24] okay my bad
[00:58:28] dude Yankee and Chase I want to but
[00:58:30] it'll probably take a while so do it
[00:58:31] later okay launch your time
[00:58:38] activates a healing field wow a tall
[00:58:41] blonde healer dressed in white who uses
[00:58:43] a Rapier sword who activates a healing
[00:58:46] field and whose primer and who can
[00:58:47] cleanse
[00:58:48] hmm where have I seen this before
[00:59:00] Ed has flowers that's like an aesthetic
[00:59:03] this is the most Gene called
[00:59:06] what was that
[00:59:10] that's not a bad thing though like I
[00:59:12] still think like that's cool yo what is
[00:59:14] oh it's not even Auto Battle what the
[00:59:15] [ __ ] isn't it okay what yo I have to
[00:59:18] read this passive
[00:59:23] when I was really drops to HP yeah but I
[00:59:24] don't think we dropped maybe I didn't
[00:59:25] look I don't know
[00:59:28] whatever
[00:59:31] that's just healing though [ __ ] it we'll
[00:59:33] heal them
[00:59:35] don't worry okay fair enough
[00:59:45] Sun's for you
[00:59:54] received Divinity don't worry about me
[00:59:59] the only thing I don't like okay I'm
[01:00:01] gonna say it I'm gonna say it I don't
[01:00:03] know if I like here's what I don't like
[01:00:04] about Lucha hot take but since we know
[01:00:08] how little my Natasha heals because
[01:00:10] she's like under geared if I play my
[01:00:12] Lucha and he heals too much you guys are
[01:00:14] gonna fly
[01:00:15] yeah you guys are gonna play me
[01:00:20] I'll be able to go back there
[01:00:29] what the [ __ ] is no offense
[01:00:31] pay off oh yeah yeah songs for you
[01:00:42] ready to lose yourself
[01:00:46] I'll rock with it thanks
[01:00:54] what is this goofy ass song never say
[01:00:56] that to Kendrick again
[01:00:57] this is your final warning
[01:01:02] okay
[01:01:03] oh [ __ ] can we
[01:01:23] with my residence capped I don't even
[01:01:25] notice uh Wow Let's go test out lucha in
[01:01:29] a cavern of corrosion let's do
[01:01:32] the wind
[01:01:36] I I uncapped it but I thought I was
[01:01:38] gonna early stream so I thought it was
[01:01:39] gonna show about like 2 p.m and then I
[01:01:42] woke up it was five and it was capped
[01:01:43] then I spent 20 and now it's capped
[01:01:46] again so I don't know the math on that
[01:01:48] but it is what it is
[01:01:54] you know I know I don't need to Aid him
[01:01:57] but if there's any chance that he likes
[01:01:59] me more if I Aid him then I'll Aid him
[01:02:01] we should level Yukon first
[01:02:05] yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay like on 80
[01:02:08] oh [ __ ] oh traces no no he was forced to
[01:02:13] level traces no
[01:02:16] I hate traces
[01:02:21] this is so good
[01:02:24] 70 percent
[01:02:27] am I missing something or is this just
[01:02:29] insane
[01:02:34] that's a cleanse we need the cleanse no
[01:02:35] matter what playing a Healer without a
[01:02:37] cleanse
[01:02:39] [Music]
[01:02:40] but I mean a field to talk about Allah
[01:02:42] yeah I'm done
[01:02:58] it doesn't stack with effect res what do
[01:03:01] you mean if it's separate it's not good
[01:03:03] or is it like wait it I thought several
[01:03:06] would make it wait
[01:03:08] wait let's explain this
[01:03:11] if it's separate that's another layer no
[01:03:13] or is it like would it just be wasted
[01:03:15] because that has to be good though if
[01:03:17] it's how I understand it
[01:03:19] separate and multiplicative oh okay well
[01:03:22] that's even
[01:03:26] that's it
[01:03:32] doesn't that mean you yeah exactly does
[01:03:34] that mean you barely need
[01:03:37] or no does that mean you barely need
[01:03:39] res
[01:03:56] in if it was additive
[01:03:59] still though you probably don't need a
[01:04:00] lot of res right
[01:04:02] whatever I'm getting it
[01:04:04] I will not have to worry about getting
[01:04:06] [ __ ]
[01:04:07] perma-fucked
[01:04:11] uh wow damage
[01:04:31] so ultimate is just damage so I assume
[01:04:34] leveling it doesn't really matter but I
[01:04:36] like I honestly believe that the bigger
[01:04:38] number you do the better person you are
[01:04:40] and I think I'm a good person so we have
[01:04:43] to level this
[01:04:44] uh what is basically oh yeah basically
[01:04:46] that never mind I'm dumb I thought that
[01:04:47] was something else
[01:04:48] ah might as well
[01:04:52] might as well
[01:04:57] bro why
[01:04:59] why am I paying eight purple [ __ ]
[01:05:02] flowers and eight purple flowers for
[01:05:05] eight percent HP and seven percent
[01:05:07] defense
[01:05:09] you don't gotta be
[01:05:12] dude you gotta be dude what is the scam
[01:05:15] what the [ __ ] is this scam
[01:05:25] this one's sure
[01:05:28] like look okay look okay yeah I get it
[01:05:32] if you're the last [ __ ] floor of
[01:05:33] memory of chaos and you're getting one
[01:05:34] shot sure but at that point [ __ ] just
[01:05:38] be better forehead get better pieces
[01:05:40] easy I'm not spending one the full day
[01:05:43] of my [ __ ] Trace resin
[01:05:46] maybe later I might do it later I mean I
[01:05:47] have enough you guys think I don't I do
[01:05:49] they're just blue right now or green I
[01:05:51] have a
[01:05:52] whatever
[01:05:55] okay let me level it a little bit more
[01:05:58] okay we must look at this all to like
[01:05:59] five yeah we'll get it to five I like
[01:06:02] seeing a bit oh we'll give it to six I
[01:06:04] like seeing big numbers okay after that
[01:06:06] we'll stop though
[01:06:09] yeah like exactly eventually you'll get
[01:06:11] them all obviously
[01:06:13] so like it's nice to have but it's like
[01:06:15] it's so expensive for defense
[01:06:17] like bro at least for like attack there
[01:06:20] some attack
[01:06:23] normals are better okay listen though so
[01:06:26] let's say you normal attack every turn
[01:06:27] on the ultra because it's a Healer who
[01:06:28] is skill point efficient okay sure
[01:06:31] but is anyone in traffic like oh my God
[01:06:33] your normals do so much no no one gives
[01:06:34] a [ __ ] but if your all does a lot people
[01:06:37] are like oh my God XOXOX your [ __ ] is
[01:06:39] massive thank you so that's why that is
[01:06:42] our logic that is our logic but yeah I
[01:06:45] know like yeah I know okay we're gonna
[01:06:48] do uh we need purple so we'll do like 15
[01:06:50] 15 purple
[01:06:52] I also could claim the trace maps from
[01:06:54] Battle pass that's why I didn't go
[01:06:55] overboard because I was like if I really
[01:06:56] need more we could just battle pass
[01:07:06] uh we'll do skill
[01:07:10] Talent now we need to use a weekly Boss
[01:07:12] Mod if we go any further so I think we
[01:07:14] will
[01:07:17] okay we're done we're done we're done
[01:07:18] we're done this is where we're leaving
[01:07:19] it for now uh I might as well get this
[01:07:21] just so I don't die and then everyone
[01:07:23] laughs at me
[01:07:24] [ __ ] this is
[01:07:26] okay we'll do this can I I can
[01:07:37] all right we're good we're good we're
[01:07:38] actually good we're actually good our
[01:07:39] Lord just [ __ ] stacked relics uh I
[01:07:43] don't know
[01:07:44] like I know what I should build I don't
[01:07:45] know what I can build I don't know what
[01:07:47] I got he's a little naked right now
[01:08:00] skills already Overkill yeah but that's
[01:08:01] fine because if his skill is overkill
[01:08:03] that means I could go speed boots and if
[01:08:05] I that's still Overkill then I can go
[01:08:06] effect res and if that's still Overkill
[01:08:08] then I can [ __ ] be like you know what
[01:08:10] [ __ ] you I build HP so I don't die and
[01:08:12] then we can save our mods smart
[01:08:15] okay sorry
[01:08:18] uh I don't know if I have musketeer if I
[01:08:21] don't I'll go to these two piece or a
[01:08:22] win set like a giga Chad
[01:08:25] real Chad's use the win set
[01:08:27] wait let's see
[01:08:30] um
[01:08:35] we'll see musketeer first and then we'll
[01:08:36] see if we do it or not I farmed this set
[01:08:38] a lot but I didn't really get
[01:08:40] I mean I guess just attack and speed is
[01:08:42] enough so something like this could be
[01:08:43] good
[01:08:45] but I if I don't have cringe it makes me
[01:08:47] if I don't have crit it makes me cringe
[01:08:49] this is pretty good no speed though
[01:08:52] as a factory no it doesn't
[01:08:56] this is pretty decent
[01:08:59] um
[01:09:02] [Music]
[01:09:08] the speed boots
[01:09:11] you're so Speedy I don't oh
[01:09:15] it has attack it's fine
[01:09:20] he wants healing boost on circlet yeah
[01:09:22] but like yeah yeah sure but won't that
[01:09:25] be like I'm willing to bet my firstborn
[01:09:27] child that it's gonna be Overkill I'm
[01:09:29] willing to bet everything that I own
[01:09:30] that we're gonna heal too much
[01:09:33] I'm willing to like I'm especially with
[01:09:35] this light cone there is no way we don't
[01:09:37] heal too much
[01:09:39] first born child whoever whatever my
[01:09:41] firstborn child is he or she is on the
[01:09:44] line on the line right now that he's
[01:09:46] gonna heal although she's gonna heal too
[01:09:48] much no matter what
[01:09:50] but we can still go healing bonus but
[01:09:52] I'm saying like exactly I'm saying like
[01:09:53] attack is probably fine I don't know if
[01:09:55] crit is fine because at that point why
[01:09:57] are you playing the wheelchair like
[01:09:58] maybe whatever let me do ball first what
[01:10:00] is our ball gonna be our Ball's gonna be
[01:10:03] attack
[01:10:04] hey nice balls man thanks man
[01:10:09] well I don't have it
[01:10:13] yo I don't have I don't have an attack
[01:10:15] or imaginary
[01:10:17] yo
[01:10:19] to have HP
[01:10:21] uh we can go space stealing station
[01:10:28] now I'm a really big fan of Fleet of the
[01:10:30] Ageless
[01:10:33] makes you tanky and gives you some
[01:10:35] attack percent
[01:10:37] but we could also just go space stealing
[01:10:44] [Music]
[01:10:54] okay let's go
[01:10:56] we'll get the ride ball for him later
[01:10:58] for now we'll just go set effect
[01:11:01] how do I not have an attackball
[01:11:04] I do but it's four star wait no this is
[01:11:06] bellabonga though I'm trolling I don't
[01:11:12] unlucky
[01:11:19] dude Lumi shut the [ __ ] up I'm sorry
[01:11:22] dude I see all your messages because for
[01:11:25] some reason you're a suspicious user
[01:11:26] stop telling me how to build this guy
[01:11:29] shut the [ __ ] up
[01:11:31] you do this all the time
[01:11:37] I'll try to reach out
[01:11:42] okay
[01:11:43] we're gonna uh
[01:11:45] we're gonna go
[01:11:46] full this set wait no I don't attack
[01:11:48] boots though
[01:11:51] hahaha
[01:11:53] okay sorry I had to I had to get that
[01:11:56] out of the way all right we're just
[01:11:58] gonna spam out on
[01:12:02] okay it's kind of mid but it's fine I'll
[01:12:05] get them to 12.
[01:12:07] because we'll probably get better ones
[01:12:08] eventually
[01:12:09] actually we'll keep that at nine for now
[01:12:15] and then for a hat we could do I really
[01:12:18] want to level this crittery one I know
[01:12:19] luitcha doesn't care as much about crit
[01:12:22] but oh never mind we have this
[01:12:29] I guess we built them like we built in
[01:12:31] Yoon
[01:12:40] probably
[01:12:48] nice oh my wait that was the oh that was
[01:12:51] the double oh my God wait I Loki don't
[01:12:54] have that much Relic actually I don't
[01:12:55] have a lot of electric speed never mind
[01:12:57] okay cool gloves will use a plus 15 okay
[01:13:00] this is too good for him though this
[01:13:02] one's only some speed but we could use
[01:13:04] it for now
[01:13:05] yeah I don't wait never mind we have
[01:13:07] this
[01:13:09] I just don't want to level a piece that
[01:13:10] only I mean he's always gonna use it
[01:13:12] though oh yeah he's worth it fine
[01:13:17] plus nine sure
[01:13:23] oh that's good
[01:13:36] wait yo what up 80 flat HP
[01:13:51] it's fine
[01:13:53] it's fine copy of it's fine all right
[01:13:56] whatever we'll just do um
[01:13:59] I kind of just want to send it so we'll
[01:14:00] just do whatever attack I have on uh
[01:14:04] yeah I think we'll just
[01:14:07] okay speed is good
[01:14:09] hopefully this gets crit like for other
[01:14:11] characters
[01:14:25] it's fine
[01:14:27] okay only thing we did level is a body
[01:14:29] but I don't think he needs healing bonus
[01:14:31] if we do we'll just go healing bonus but
[01:14:33] I don't think we're gonna need it that
[01:14:34] is my prediction so we're gonna go
[01:14:35] attack with
[01:14:37] uh effect resin speed looks tasty so
[01:14:40] we'll just auto level this
[01:14:43] oh
[01:14:46] this
[01:14:48] why does everyone say run if you're new
[01:14:50] oh they're just kidding don't worry yo
[01:14:51] you don't want to do that don't worry
[01:14:54] don't worry don't worry okay
[01:15:00] yeah they're just kidding don't worry
[01:15:02] about that
[01:15:14] okay nice 100 why did I why
[01:15:18] did I yo what
[01:15:22] does that have a 118 HP
[01:15:26] whatever this should be good enough for
[01:15:27] now obviously our sphere should not be
[01:15:29] HP but I don't have an attack one so
[01:15:30] whatever or even imaginary so we're just
[01:15:32] gonna chill like this for now and then
[01:15:34] we'll see and if we don't uh we'll level
[01:15:36] them later Yukon dude I don't want to
[01:15:38] level every character it takes so long
[01:15:40] so long
[01:15:57] wait I need the same [ __ ] math as
[01:16:02] gonna regret leveling her dude look at
[01:16:05] her
[01:16:06] look at her
[01:16:14] dude it's the same [ __ ] enemy not bro
[01:16:16] I can't I legit can't afford it I didn't
[01:16:19] know it was the same one

[01:17:03] okay listen we're gonna do our first
[01:17:05] clear we're gonna do only him

[01:17:40] [ __ ]
[01:17:42] this battle you guys Basics can imprison
[01:17:45] oh I guess that's the shield break thing
[01:17:46] yeah yeah that's why
[01:17:49] imaginary moment
[01:17:57] forgot how imaginary works
[01:17:59] time
[01:18:04] so you are afraid of me
[01:18:07] I'm gonna wait till we get our [ __ ]
[01:18:11] to guard and defense crush them
[01:18:18] disappear among the Sea of butterfly HP

[01:18:33] Buzz 2008
[01:18:38] lending your strength

[01:19:31] illusions of the past
[01:19:33] we're not on healing bonus
[01:19:36] the dead returns
[01:19:43] this is double speed

[01:19:49] [Applause]
[01:19:51] Troublesome
[01:20:00] yeah
[01:20:03] disappear yeah I might unironically go
[01:20:06] crit we'll see or I'll go imaginary ball
[01:20:07] first actually no I don't even have an
[01:20:09] attackball it's not HP
[01:20:12] who's next
[01:20:18] yeah
[01:20:21] oh she's not leveled right wait how do I
[01:20:23] check
[01:20:26] okay cool I pressed the wrong button
[01:20:27] well let me press c yeah well she's
[01:20:30] almost 70. bro silly is 80 and on 26.
[01:20:33] so like I think we could overheal even
[01:20:35] if we don't have uh a healing set on or
[01:20:38] anything
[01:20:46] okay cool
[01:20:48] that could be good
[01:20:49] that could be good okay not bad
[01:20:53] yeah let's go do relevant content
[01:20:56] but first
[01:20:58] I actually think we don't need that much
[01:21:00] healing unironically
[01:21:03] um so I don't know and we're not even
[01:21:04] like like bro I'm on [ __ ] HP because
[01:21:06] I don't have attack so I don't actually
[01:21:07] know what to do I think we go do Fleet
[01:21:09] of the Ageless see if we can get a
[01:21:10] better one
[01:21:13] and low key like
[01:21:21] either attack ball crit body or attack
[01:21:24] body imaginary ball
[01:21:27] we'll see
[01:21:28] let me go Clear My Level Rewards
[01:21:36] zero X can you voice the [ __ ] is pom pom
[01:21:41] bro what are you doing
[01:21:43] yeah I can
[01:21:54] um
[01:21:57] huh
[01:21:59] we also have this as our feather a
[01:22:02] flower I mean gloves I could just join
[01:22:04] yanjings
[01:22:05] and then I actually have some crit
[01:22:12] well I mean we have 13 crit rate
[01:22:17] can I give him a hot weapon did imagine
[01:22:20] I could give him a hot weapon
[01:22:23] okay maybe we don't take this these
[01:22:24] clothes
[01:22:32] okay we'll try to get a better ball
[01:22:34] we'll go do that and then we'll see what
[01:22:35] happens
[01:22:37] uh in the meantime balls
[01:22:46] okay let's go do that
[01:22:54] wait should I bring Yukon though
[01:22:57] okay if I'm gonna play her I need to
[01:22:59] [ __ ]
[01:23:04] all right we don't talk about it okay
[01:23:06] cool
[01:23:10] bro's obsessed with critting with a
[01:23:11] Healer dude we have too much healing we
[01:23:14] want me to do
[01:23:16] I guess Fair no one cares about his
[01:23:18] damage
[01:23:20] um
[01:23:21] I build Jean on crit and he's the gene
[01:23:23] of star rail so
[01:23:25] no one's going attack Gene anymore
[01:23:45] wait where's the others
[01:23:58] yeah to use I mean yukon's buff does
[01:24:01] seem like a pain in the ass to keep up
[01:24:03] so I don't know I haven't played her yet
[01:24:04] we're gonna see like right now right
[01:24:06] here right now right here emerge right
[01:24:10] now
[01:24:14] all right we're not gonna level this yet
[01:24:18] the only problem is I've been neglecting
[01:24:20] the traces on all of my other characters
[01:24:22] and only leveling the [ __ ] new
[01:24:24] characters so that so it kind of feels
[01:24:27] unfair if I full level yukon's [ __ ] but
[01:24:30] my team Yoon still looks like this
[01:24:32] uh-huh okay
[01:24:34] um
[01:24:37] like low-key like my yeah
[01:24:52] like this feels dude like this is just
[01:24:54] kind of toxic
[01:24:55] okay we'll level a little bit we'll love
[01:24:57] a little bit let's
[01:25:03] probably should get that that's actually
[01:25:04] huge
[01:25:06] okay you count first though
[01:25:10] oh you have the feel the Magic Door all
[01:25:12] right not bad with uh the the [ __ ] dude
[01:25:20] [Music]
[01:25:23] wait how the [ __ ] am I building her
[01:25:25] weight
[01:25:26] what does the Buffs go on
[01:25:28] it's 40 percent
[01:25:31] eh
[01:25:33] okay it doesn't matter
[01:25:40] sub DPS I guess
[01:25:43] okay
[01:25:49] we're gonna go
[01:25:51] um
[01:25:51] literally any set in the game so we'll
[01:25:53] do like
[01:26:00] I don't think I've farmed the imaginary
[01:26:02] set once in my life okay we'll go
[01:26:03] [ __ ] all right [ __ ] you yanching
[01:26:13] sorry I love yanching but you got to do
[01:26:15] what you gotta do
[01:26:27] you know I might have to just go sub
[01:26:28] stats
[01:26:30] oh I just have to go stop stats
[01:26:55] am I silly still I'm a four-star hat
[01:26:58] [ __ ]
[01:27:02] give me that
[01:27:04] and then we probably want imaginary err
[01:27:07] what's that do I have an ER rope on
[01:27:09] effect
[01:27:12] wait where is it
[01:27:15] wait bro where the [ __ ] is am I blind
[01:27:18] where is it
[01:27:26] am I missing something
[01:27:30] okay there's no err there whatever is it
[01:27:33] a different thing oh man's Dot
[01:27:38] ah
[01:27:41] uh oh
[01:27:43] we could go for the inner risotto
[01:27:52] yep risotto sure
[01:27:55] good do I have nice balls on imaginary
[01:27:58] or no
[01:27:58] imaginary and oh not bad all right cool
[01:28:01] we'll do this for now
[01:28:03] we'll get it to like Plus
[01:28:06] we'll see
[01:28:07] six or nine maybe nine maybe nine maybe
[01:28:09] nine get a little bit of energy get a
[01:28:11] little bit of energy here and there
[01:28:13] okay light it's time
[01:28:15] at this point we might as well get never
[01:28:17] mind we'll do that then
[01:28:18] actually we'll get to 12.
[01:28:27] okay
[01:28:29] as long as you don't get
[01:28:31] sometimes it's not bad
[01:28:33] okay not the best pieces but good enough
[01:28:36] for now I guess it's plus six it's gonna
[01:28:38] hit crit don't be surprised when it does
[01:28:39] it did we're gonna get to nine it's
[01:28:40] gonna hit crit damage this time instead
[01:28:42] of crit rate and then we'll have a
[01:28:43] perfect flower
[01:28:44] hot
[01:28:46] headpiece okay nice
[01:28:49] okay
[01:28:59] Story of My Life

[01:29:36] because I also need to level like
[01:29:38] why is there an eye I also need to level
[01:29:40] like other characters traces so we'll be
[01:29:42] we'll be nice and uh
[01:29:47] careful with the way we why don't have
[01:29:48] this we'll be nice and careful with the
[01:29:50] way I spend

[01:30:19] imaginary ball

[01:30:25] for
[01:30:27] we're going to play
[01:30:29] what if we play Ting Yoon and then green
[01:30:31] Ting Yoon no but
[01:30:34] okay hear me out we do skill point
[01:30:36] efficient
[01:30:38] no sorry inefficient skill point
[01:30:40] inefficient then skill point efficient
[01:30:41] and then
[01:30:43] wait but Sealy takes like 50 turns
[01:30:57] why did I level her
[01:30:59] did she takes like 50 turns
[01:31:05] that's why I don't play Steely anymore
[01:31:06] dude I would rather not play Yukon than
[01:31:08] not play Sealy Celia's yo she's insane
[01:31:11] what do you talk about
[01:31:17] we could yeah we could
[01:31:21] story of my life we could Jing you out
[01:31:23] we could Yan ching
[01:31:25] we could play our main man Ian
[01:31:34] but we would need silver wolf if we want
[01:31:36] to implant something in Japan
[01:31:45] our lightning Lord yo our genuine stats
[01:31:47] are not as good though like you guys are
[01:31:48] gonna laugh at me and I don't like that
[01:31:50] I don't like being laughed at that hurts
[01:31:51] it hurts me
[01:31:55] like we're it's a work in progress we
[01:31:57] have a good build in theory but in
[01:32:00] practice it's not that great
[01:32:11] yeah we'll try it see what happens
[01:32:14] and then we'll do uh we have to do
[01:32:16] memory of chaos too
[01:32:17] but for that I would actually need all
[01:32:19] my characters to be built and I can't be
[01:32:21] asked to build that Runner now I think
[01:32:22] they're all built except I kind of yeah
[01:32:25] okay we don't listen listen I don't know

[01:32:35] anyone
[01:32:37] wait why the [ __ ] is she on those
[01:32:38] actually

[01:33:52] always got the advanced forward yeah
[01:33:54] it's good
[01:33:55] but I like more destructible objects

[01:34:57] put him full attack for now well attack
[01:34:59] speed for now
[01:35:00] but we don't have an attackball
[01:35:02] so I'm trying to get uh either imaginary
[01:35:04] or attackball
[01:35:06] and then we'll go that build I might go
[01:35:08] crit body
[01:35:11] YouTube bait

[01:36:00] worst that can happen

[01:36:03] mind and we're returning to work all
[01:36:06] right domain
[01:36:08] never let your guard down in front of
[01:36:09] your enemy let's wait and see

[01:36:27] needs up this is double speed
[01:36:34] and we implant Quantum
[01:36:36] then we
[01:36:38] caught in his face
[01:36:49] the wind is right well I shouldn't hold
[01:36:52] it

[01:37:22] and then finalize it's fine okay I
[01:37:25] didn't quit
[01:37:28] oh these are buffed a lot though
[01:37:41] stay the course
[01:37:54] I actually want to take damage because I
[01:37:55] want to heal him like I'm trying to heal
[01:37:57] on though don't mess with me
[01:38:01] okay cool then we attack here then we
[01:38:03] buff everyone
[01:38:06] the wind is rising

[01:38:25] I already used the Third
[01:38:29] no it's no it's silver wolf that was
[01:38:31] Sealy's turn and I don't have my thing
[01:38:33] About Bob
[01:38:35] why am I not buff
[01:38:41] whatever
[01:38:42] it's fine we're gonna get the ball we
[01:38:44] want from this
[01:38:47] ah Donald speedrunning so I'll just do
[01:38:50] that
[01:38:56] okay oh that sucks yeah well how's that
[01:39:04] get on paper until you player I listen
[01:39:06] here bud I said on paper it looks
[01:39:09] it looks not fun but it might be work
[01:39:12] aroundable if you like speed manage and
[01:39:15] [ __ ] manage but uh we'll see
[01:39:20] curio give me uh
[01:39:22] I'm a beautiful robe no that's probably
[01:39:25] the cheese is better but I don't wanna
[01:39:26] if I have E1 then it [ __ ] with
[01:39:28] everything
[01:39:29] how would I know what's you wanna what's
[01:39:30] not E1 unless I read I'm not reading
[01:39:37] you took the bait

[01:39:42] you guys are telling me now oh you
[01:39:44] regret it no because she's pretty it's
[01:39:46] gonna be worth it we'll make her work

[01:39:54] Twitter one's better with rose
[01:39:59] hello Julie thanks Lorraine
[01:40:04] you took bait
[01:40:06] can you show your luau just build uh
[01:40:08] it's not ideal right now but it is on so
[01:40:11] I think luocha heals so much that we're
[01:40:14] probably gonna go crit but for now we
[01:40:15] just want full attack with speed boots
[01:40:17] uh but I think we might want to try like
[01:40:20] some more damage
[01:40:27] is it bad if it heals too much no it's
[01:40:30] just not needed like the thing with like
[01:40:32] like if you go full attack
[01:40:35] on Gene you're kind of griefing because
[01:40:38] like you're losing out on damage that
[01:40:40] you would have had and I I don't know if
[01:40:42] he's
[01:40:43] like that yet but it feels like he might
[01:40:45] be unless like the content you're doing
[01:40:47] is like you have your characters have
[01:40:48] like 4K HP and they're taking like 3 000
[01:40:51] Maybe
[01:41:05] I'm gonna go touch grass I hope the
[01:41:07] grass eats you and then you're like [ __ ]
[01:41:09] I lost the finger I'm never going
[01:41:10] outside again
[01:41:13] and then you stay in the Stream where

[01:51:58] like praying that your action doesn't
[01:51:59] get Advanced forward by something you
[01:52:01] forgot about so you don't accidentally
[01:52:03] lose your entire buff that's my favorite
[01:52:05] part of her actually I think that's my
[01:52:07] favorite part of thinking of uh Yukon
[01:52:08] not opinion
[01:52:10] Korean
[01:52:12] whatever same thing Yukon
[01:52:16] I'm glad we're all out safely
[01:52:20] pulse trap
[01:52:22] okay that sucks uh attack attack ball
[01:52:24] would be what we're looking for even if
[01:52:26] it's four star okay three star okay
[01:52:29] all right never mind that was a waste of
[01:52:31] time
[01:52:42] oh we'll claim this later I don't know
[01:52:47] I want to get 65 so I can do the next
[01:52:49] ones right six don't wait is it 70 when
[01:52:51] the [ __ ] uh 65k yeah I want to get 65.
[01:52:54] whatever
[01:52:56] okay uh I want to do memory of chaos and
[01:52:59] reset since I last played but I don't
[01:53:01] know if my okay so all of my characters
[01:53:02] are geared pretty decently except I have
[01:53:06] this weird thing where I level every new
[01:53:07] character that comes out but I haven't
[01:53:08] finished leveling my like base
[01:53:09] characters so low key our Ting you might
[01:53:12] get [ __ ] slammed
[01:53:16] but uh it's fine Shirley
[01:53:29] [ __ ] I want this one
[01:53:41] just use your part
[01:53:44] yeah no worries I have to fart
[01:53:54] wait surely I don't need three Harmony
[01:53:56] weapons right well am I actually gonna
[01:53:58] play three
[01:53:59] yep three
[01:54:03] sure they only play two
[01:54:12] foreign
[01:54:30] now keep in mind I'm gonna have to make
[01:54:32] sure all my characters are geared though
[01:54:33] so I'm sorry I'm sorry I just have to
[01:54:35] make sure I have so
[01:54:37] I have to make sure okay are the watches
[01:54:39] [ __ ] could be a little no I didn't say
[01:54:42] that his coffin could be a little bit
[01:54:43] nicer so let's give him a little bit
[01:54:45] more damage because I don't think he
[01:54:46] needs this much feeling
[01:54:48] yo I'm rolling over my wire all the time
[01:54:53] all right whatever I've given up it's
[01:54:55] fully Tangled am I oh I'm just gonna
[01:54:57] give up whatever
[01:54:59] oh wait this imaginary ball sucks though
[01:55:01] oh dude
[01:55:04] I'd rather go attack but
[01:55:07] whatever we're just gonna do this it's
[01:55:09] fine it's fine it's fine for now it's
[01:55:11] fine
[01:55:12] I'll get it to like plus like not six
[01:55:15] we'll get to six
[01:55:20] foreign
[01:55:21] even this should be more than enough
[01:55:28] I kind of wanted to be a little bit
[01:55:29] tankier
[01:55:31] um so we're gonna go we're gonna filter
[01:55:33] by Celestial differentiator make sure
[01:55:36] she doesn't get one shot by whoever we
[01:55:37] fight I only have three okay that's cool
[01:55:40] but we can just take this boom
[01:55:42] okay
[01:55:44] okay
[01:55:46] bomb
[01:55:49] I don't know why I'm on this but
[01:55:51] whatever I guess
[01:55:55] okay so far so good 4000 HP silly is uh
[01:56:00] pretty good I see this not bad
[01:56:02] uh there's a little bit of like I'm
[01:56:04] still waiting for a better body than
[01:56:06] this but we might have one actually
[01:56:11] no why did I say we might drive up I I
[01:56:14] don't okay
[01:56:15] well I lied me when I spread
[01:56:17] misinformation
[01:56:20] uh yeah I definitely spread
[01:56:22] misinformation
[01:56:24] but we might be able to go to four piece
[01:56:27] because I probably have a good attack
[01:56:28] boot please
[01:56:30] I don't
[01:56:32] I don't I don't have an attack boot I
[01:56:35] don't have a single attack boot
[01:56:38] no worries uh we could just go
[01:56:43] Um
[01:56:44] Loki this is our most could damage one
[01:56:46] and that's what he needs this is
[01:56:46] probably the best one even though it's a
[01:56:47] four star gloves are fine that's fine
[01:56:50] that's fine that's honestly pretty good
[01:56:54] this is atrocious though do you have a
[01:56:55] better inert yep inert
[01:57:04] I do but it's on yanching
[01:57:06] and I do love my engine
[01:57:09] he is best boy
[01:57:13] that's fine
[01:57:16] okay I think we're good uh let me just
[01:57:18] make sure Relic good good good good
[01:57:21] uh we should level her like on but it
[01:57:23] doesn't matter this is fine for now okay
[01:57:28] what does it look like that no it's fine
[01:57:29] you don't need to level it I might need
[01:57:31] to level this but it's fine
[01:57:43] yeah I think we're good
[01:57:45] are they character who's not good
[01:57:48] is our genuine is kind of mid right now
[01:57:51] and I commissioned Fang to draw me
[01:57:53] shortlisting Yuan
[01:57:55] and she did
[01:57:57] it's not done yet but I am very
[01:57:59] anticipating it so we should probably
[01:58:00] play him a little bit more
[01:58:05] don't type
[01:58:09] his VA signs it if I saw you honestly if
[01:58:12] he signs it
[01:58:13] dude imagine that dude I would be
[01:58:15] winning so I want to make him better but
[01:58:18] it's just hard like right now so he's
[01:58:19] kind of mid we could still use him but
[01:58:21] he is very mid
[01:58:25] our yanching's really good though really
[01:58:27] really good

[02:05:36] Spirit Never Dies
[02:05:38] El
[02:05:40] now we're buffed
[02:05:43] off damage kind of whatever but it is
[02:05:45] what it is

[02:06:15] heal with my skill but then they got
[02:06:16] full healed what's happened
[02:06:20] all right well
[02:06:21] might be a little overkill on the
[02:06:22] healing uh let's just poke them

[02:07:05] technique
[02:07:06] I can't
[02:07:07] XD I know it applies the passive thing

[02:07:14] sure whatever
[02:07:17] I'll see you all

[02:08:11] in mind imagine
[02:08:13] so bear that in mind uh second off we'll
[02:08:16] play
[02:08:18] probably the same team I really do like

[02:08:21] and then first half we'll do
[02:08:25] Auto it yeah I might Auto it but I can't
[02:08:27] you can't Auto with [ __ ] yanching bro
[02:08:29] it takes like they literally start basic
[02:08:30] attacking on them
[02:08:41] built him right okay my build is correct
[02:08:44] it's just aren't bad like I only have 60
[02:08:46] crit damage it's not my like one doesn't
[02:08:48] have crit on it and I don't have good
[02:08:50] enough Relic stats on a set it's not
[02:08:52] like I don't know how to build just not
[02:08:53] it's unlucky it is what it is unless I
[02:08:56] go like no two like zero piece set
[02:08:58] like One Piece One Piece
[02:09:09] it should be fine though we don't need
[02:09:11] crit it's fine we'll be fine
[02:09:18] one piece oh my God I love one p

[02:10:16] I'm such a fool I [ __ ] it probably all
[02:10:19] thought about that
[02:10:24] when I come in with an army let's wait

[02:11:46] lose
[02:11:47] Thunder
[02:11:51] this shot shut the [ __ ] up

[02:13:03] don't want me to say it I know you don't
[02:13:04] I'm gonna [ __ ] say it
[02:13:10] welcome customers
[02:13:13] I'm gonna say it I [ __ ] hate every
[02:13:15] Edition characters because the enemies
[02:13:17] in this game are like one strong enemy
[02:13:19] that takes like a million HP and then
[02:13:21] four [ __ ] [ __ ] runs that take one
[02:13:24] hit of damage and then die through your
[02:13:26] Edition character does nothing after one
[02:13:28] hit
[02:13:34] time like I wish there was like three
[02:13:37] bosses you fight at once and then
[02:13:39] genuine's like big [ __ ]
[02:13:41] fun
[02:13:44] thank you
[02:13:45] the moment
[02:13:48] follow my chart
[02:13:51] like I wish we were in a scenario where
[02:13:54] I'd be like you know what there's so
[02:13:56] many enemies that I want to reduce their
[02:13:57] defense of that maybe I'll play Pila
[02:13:59] over
[02:14:00] silver wolf maybe I'll play Xiao over
[02:14:03] hutau I would like to go back to genjen
[02:14:05] 1.4 okay that's what I'm saying
[02:14:09] I mean right now that's true
[02:14:12] right
[02:14:30] there's no damage customers is Talent
[02:14:31] which is as good an AOE as in single
[02:14:33] Target are you dumb
[02:14:39] okay listen
[02:14:42] if I do a thousand damage a hundred
[02:14:44] thousand damage to an enemy if it is one
[02:14:46] enemy or two enemies but it does a
[02:14:48] hundred thousand to one and then fifty
[02:14:50] thousand to both adjacent ones don't you
[02:14:52] think the damage he does is higher
[02:14:53] against more than one enemy every time
[02:14:55] his lightning thing goes to other [ __ ]
[02:14:57] it hits AOE stuff so you'll miss you're
[02:15:00] losing out on so much [ __ ] damage if
[02:15:03] it's single Target like that doesn't
[02:15:05] mean he's useless single Target like
[02:15:07] yeah the lighting Lord's still gonna
[02:15:08] [ __ ] strike the dude but it's like an
[02:15:11] AOE it's a lot better
[02:15:13] enemies ahead up for a scrap sleep not
[02:15:17] haste well I probably shouldn't have
[02:15:18] done that ah whatever uh we'll hit this
[02:15:20] dude
[02:15:23] why are you so loud it's not loud
[02:15:27] I'm not loud
[02:15:30] what do you think about my
[02:15:36] favorite video like this
[02:15:38] yeah sorry guys I'll have to drive
[02:15:39] through right now anyone want an order
[02:15:41] no thank God two-piece McNuggets
[02:15:50] what the [ __ ] I used to be better though
[02:15:53] because I could I used to make it on my
[02:15:54] webcam mic now it's on my actual good
[02:15:56] mic so it's a bit less scuffed I got
[02:15:58] worse
[02:15:59] oh I forgot modeling the witch I
[02:16:01] actually have to heal okay we'll heal
[02:16:02] there
[02:16:03] this might be her 2000 HP might be a
[02:16:06] problem in the future but it's fine this
[02:16:08] combat needs up this is double speed
[02:16:20] okay so we skill first then we Alt
[02:16:27] because there's not here in Canada
[02:16:36] collusions of the past
[02:16:38] oh that was pretty good oh
[02:16:46] wait why am I using one of yukong's buff
[02:16:48] turns on
[02:16:50] bailua
[02:16:51] don't mess with me
[02:16:59] [ __ ] oh my God I waste the Third
[02:17:08] I'm glad we're all out safely
[02:17:14] not hey
[02:17:22] trickier to crack
[02:17:24] okay we're gonna do this
[02:17:30] all right which was on our second half
[02:17:33] or first half this is our second
[02:17:38] bro I have one stack okay my speed is
[02:17:41] not lined up we're gonna have to skill
[02:17:42] again
[02:17:51] I don't wanna alt till my Yukon holds
[02:17:53] but it's probably not worth it so we're
[02:17:54] just gonna help
[02:18:02] if I'm not gonna die it's fine we're not
[02:18:04] gonna die
[02:18:06] We're Not Gonna

[02:18:25] abilities
[02:18:29] how are you

[02:38:00] what a headache
[02:38:04] I'll see you off
[02:38:07] more enemies

[02:38:47] later it doesn't matter
[02:38:49] dude anytime you play [ __ ] team or
[02:38:52] green Ting you every enemy just attacks
[02:38:54] them why why get a life hit anyone else
[02:38:57] hit anyone else
[02:39:00] whatever we'll just I don't care I'll do
[02:39:02] it later it's fine
[02:39:06] that's fine it's fine at least here we
[02:39:08] can do yanching yanjing
[02:39:11] and then we'll be chilling yeah we're
[02:39:13] happy and then here we do [ __ ]
[02:39:15] boom
[02:39:17] boom
[02:39:19] and then whatever the [ __ ]
[02:39:22] it's fine copium
[02:39:33] all right this will be better you go
[02:39:35] again
[02:39:38] dude they yeah I don't know why anytime
[02:39:40] you play a [ __ ] Harmony character
[02:39:41] every single enemy and their mom decides
[02:39:44] to anger you
[02:39:53] that's a tear to crack
[02:39:55] okay
[02:40:04] yo what the [ __ ] happening to HP
[02:40:09] here
[02:40:19] [Music]
[02:40:22] what a headache
[02:40:25] I'll free you from your disappearance
[02:40:28] cause maybe it's because I can't
[02:40:32] oh I [ __ ] messed me that can't talk
[02:40:34] as much when I'm doing stereo memory of
[02:40:36] Chaos
[02:40:37] so maybe that's uh skewing the sample
[02:40:39] size but I swear to God the star rail
[02:40:43] chat experience is so much worse than
[02:40:45] gentian it's not even close my enemies
[02:40:48] it's literally like it's like it's like
[02:40:50] if you think gechen's bad so first of
[02:40:52] all I've seen League chats league is
[02:40:53] worse but like under it gentian's like
[02:40:55] there but then starl is like I think it
[02:40:58] might actually be worse than like any
[02:41:00] other thing I've ever seen
[02:41:02] it's actually incredible it's so bad
[02:41:08] yeah it actually makes genjin look
[02:41:10] better
[02:41:13] please don't kill my thing again okay
[02:41:14] cool
[02:41:19] oh that was a good balance
[02:41:26] he's the moment yeah
[02:41:40] don't mess with me
[02:41:44] you don't look so good
[02:41:50] okay the problem isn't that people are
[02:41:51] down because everyone's down bad for
[02:41:53] ganshee characters too so that thought
[02:41:55] really it's also that like there's less
[02:41:59] um interactive content happening so less
[02:42:01] people are typing about the content so
[02:42:03] more people are typing like weird [ __ ]
[02:42:06] about characters and then that just
[02:42:08] turns into like that's the only thing
[02:42:09] you see in chat I think is why
[02:42:12] it's not like people on genjen aren't
[02:42:14] down bad it's just like yeah
[02:42:21] but whatever
[02:42:25] it's not trickier to crack but like what
[02:42:27] the [ __ ] can I do about that like it's
[02:42:29] not like I could be like I don't know
[02:42:30] what to do maybe play maybe if we like
[02:42:33] cleanse the chat and just play shangling
[02:42:34] Paradise maybe that's what we need

[03:03:56] second half I don't know uh so we're
[03:03:59] gonna do the workshop with uh Brownie
[03:04:01] and then we'll have two cleanses I
[03:04:03] didn't know a second half uh yeah so
[03:04:05] we're gonna do that and then first half
[03:04:06] we can do it orienting I think we had
[03:04:08] enough turns even with yanjing honestly
[03:04:11] I think we actually had enough time
[03:04:14] um
[03:04:16] tack the main one they would have died
[03:04:17] [ __ ] you
[03:04:20] I don't want to talk about it
[03:04:25] like who do we even play in this team
[03:04:26] though we have like no one I mean I
[03:04:28] guess we could do a shield there but
[03:04:29] shielder's useless
[03:04:33] I guess it isn't
[03:04:45] so much better though
[03:04:54] we need because we don't have like dude
[03:04:56] like look at these sub stats they're so
[03:04:58] [ __ ] ass
[03:05:04] like what is this
[03:05:07] what is this
[03:05:23] like we could do two bees two piece but
[03:05:25] we don't even have a good
[03:05:27] boot on the other set we just don't have
[03:05:29] good uh musk boots
[03:05:39] oh
[03:05:43] I could do it like this
[03:05:50] what about this
[03:05:52] this is better this is actually better
[03:05:54] 55 110 actually better without a crit
[03:05:58] Weapon It's actually better
[03:06:17] no I'll try it
[03:06:19] I'll say we perform
[03:06:25] we'll see if we perform or not continue
[03:06:27] bye Lou lament wait why am I using
[03:06:30] Lament
[03:06:38] no paper B especially not without
[03:06:40] refinements the highway stack makes up
[03:06:41] for it also it's yeah it's not worth
[03:06:44] leveling like five weapons or like guns
[03:06:47] wait who am I using instead of the
[03:06:49] shielder
[03:06:53] silly boom and then double Clans and
[03:06:56] then here we do

[03:08:10] win
[03:08:10] like we have way more than enough damage
[03:08:12] but

[03:15:45] healing is really high mine might be low
[03:15:47] because she's under geared but like her
[03:15:50] healing's really high it's just she

[03:15:54] healers instead

[03:42:04] we might just get two stars if we don't
[03:42:06] know because our first half sucked but I
[03:42:07] think I think we we [ __ ] this up I
