[00:15:04] I hope you are enjoying the you were
[00:15:06] enjoying the
[00:15:10] hi welcome to welcome to so I uh today
[00:15:13] we have a stream of all time but it will
[00:15:15] be one of the best streams of all time
[00:15:16] maybe I don't know but uh so
[00:15:20] let's talk about what's happening today
[00:15:21] so we're going to do uh a gentle stream
[00:15:24] as always
[00:15:26] but not a typical Dentistry because
[00:15:28] somehow we are partnering with [ __ ] which
[00:15:31] is Bank of Montreal which is a Canadian
[00:15:33] bank that is very POG and there's
[00:15:34] something very special that they have
[00:15:36] prepared for you that I want to talk
[00:15:37] about but first
[00:15:38] Hi how are you I'm good no one asked me
[00:15:42] but I thought maybe you guys should ask
[00:15:43] me how I'm doing before I ask how you
[00:15:45] guys are doing
[00:15:48] I'm doing good anyways so
[00:15:51] I'm still sick but it is what it is uh
[00:15:55] it is not free resin uh that is not what
[00:15:58] I got although I do have resin and we
[00:16:00] will be spending it
[00:16:02] but anyways hello I hope the audio is
[00:16:04] fine
[00:16:06] um
[00:16:07] I'll be talking more about what exactly
[00:16:09] is happening today but for now
[00:16:12] I have to be careful for my throat for
[00:16:14] now no a few things one okay a few
[00:16:17] things one
[00:16:19] we're partnering with [ __ ] for the stream
[00:16:20] and they prepare something special for
[00:16:21] you guys which we'll talk about number
[00:16:23] two I have to be on my best behavior and
[00:16:25] so do you guys I don't trust myself to
[00:16:28] not swear accidentally if I do I'll pull
[00:16:31] but I'll try not to actually I won't and
[00:16:34] you guys also have to be on your best
[00:16:35] behavior together we're on our best
[00:16:37] behaviors and we're all happy and we're
[00:16:39] all cool okay okay
[00:16:45] uh yeah so yeah uh we're gonna get to
[00:16:49] the cool thing that be well prepared for
[00:16:52] us after a bit of gameplay so first I
[00:16:54] get to play against your impact a little
[00:16:55] bit wow my favorite game I can't wait to
[00:16:57] get into the impact also since I just
[00:17:00] got home from traveling I haven't really
[00:17:03] played the engine in a while so we
[00:17:05] actually have a lot of resin because I
[00:17:07] met up with my friend J Cole who gave me
[00:17:10] a lot of resin because I helped put him
[00:17:12] on the map when he was an underground
[00:17:13] and unknown artist so that's why we have
[00:17:16] the resin hopefully the stream quality
[00:17:17] is fine we're gonna spend all this resin
[00:17:19] in the new domain
[00:17:21] listen okay listen listen do you would
[00:17:25] you rather me spend my resident officer
[00:17:27] and be honest be honest be honest
[00:17:32] would you rather me spend it off stream
[00:17:34] no so we saved it for you guys uh and
[00:17:37] we're gonna spend this that is okay wait
[00:17:39] okay wait there actually is a bit more
[00:17:40] we have to do because this probably
[00:17:41] won't take that long so we're gonna
[00:17:42] spend all of our resin uh and then if we
[00:17:44] have time we'll do Abyss if we don't
[00:17:46] have time for this we'll spend more
[00:17:48] resin and then that'll be cool
[00:17:51] um
[00:17:52] you sound so sick my left nostril is
[00:17:54] plugged
[00:17:55] I guess that means I'm sick I mean I am
[00:17:56] sick but like it's not like that bad
[00:17:58] it's just like a little sick so yeah
[00:18:01] uh we're gonna actually let me do my
[00:18:03] dailies and stuff first we'll do our
[00:18:05] dailies and stuff first whereas the chat
[00:18:06] on screen I don't trust you guys I I
[00:18:08] didn't trust you guys to behave so I
[00:18:11] don't dude I don't trust you if you guys
[00:18:13] listen listen if you guys can show that
[00:18:15] you're on your best behavior then we
[00:18:17] will recompense you next time is you
[00:18:19] have to earn it first
[00:18:22] claim your reputation oh dude I
[00:18:25] hecking forgot to do okay

[00:28:09] stop focusing on it
[00:28:13] sorry I'm sorry
[00:28:15] [Laughter]
[00:28:20] listen
[00:28:22] listen
[00:28:27] my eyes hurt okay listen here
[00:28:34] we killed we killed her
[00:28:41] well I can see if I can restart it
[00:28:46] I'll probably restart it in the um
[00:28:50] okay I could okay okay okay chat
[00:28:54] chat I could I think I know why it's
[00:28:57] laggy I could fix it but then there
[00:28:59] might not be desktop audio and if
[00:29:01] there's no desktop audio
[00:29:03] monkey w
[00:29:05] ow all right I thought that
[00:29:09] it's probably better though I could just
[00:29:11] mimic the sounds just make the noises
[00:29:16] I mean I could do that
[00:29:33] yeah I'm pretty sure after and like
[00:29:36] after we do the cool thing of [ __ ]
[00:29:39] prepared for us
[00:29:42] um
[00:29:43] I could probably reset it
[00:29:55] yo
[00:29:56] this is catching on the switch
[00:30:01] [Music]
[00:30:09] okay I missed
[00:30:17] dude listen
[00:30:20] wait is it actually
[00:30:24] [Music]
[00:30:25] hey should I pull for hutao or not yet
[00:30:29] um
[00:30:29] well one of them
[00:30:31] oh wait this could be good
[00:30:34] unlucky
[00:30:38] one of them is not yet I thought it was
[00:30:40] pretty good
[00:30:41] so I guess I'll have to see how good an
[00:30:42] event is but I can't see a world where I
[00:30:45] don't pull from it yet I also can't see
[00:30:47] uh I also can't see a world where he
[00:30:49] isn't
[00:30:50] a giga Chad so hopefully he's good
[00:30:53] [Music]
[00:30:54] but dude okay literally he floats and he
[00:30:58] literally floats and unleashes water
[00:31:00] onto everyone so if you're not pulling
[00:31:01] for that even if he's mad I mean if he's
[00:31:03] like Day level then don't but as long as
[00:31:06] he's like fine
[00:31:11] there's no way they release a bat surely
[00:31:14] they don't make them bad there's no way
[00:31:20] oh my game is in English it's not show
[00:31:22] time
[00:31:25] who would pull before the arc on
[00:31:34] yeah
[00:31:35] foreign
[00:31:40] will probably be broken
[00:31:46] is an Easy Pass really who's skipping
[00:31:49] the Ark on
[00:31:51] who's skipping the archon
[00:31:54] oh that looks good
[00:31:56] oh wait that's insane what the hell
[00:31:59] wait
[00:32:02] whoa that's like three what the hell
[00:32:05] wait that's actually three good stats
[00:32:06] can't wait wait let me level this
[00:32:10] she's annoying yeah I mean she's okay
[00:32:12] but in a cute way also she's an archon
[00:32:18] so what she's a little goofy
[00:32:30] but uh yeah
[00:32:33] before I roll this piece I do want to
[00:32:34] tell you guys I am very excited for what
[00:32:36] we're gonna witness in like a few
[00:32:37] minutes that [ __ ] prepare or [ __ ] prepared
[00:32:40] for us
[00:32:41] I almost did I had 10 million more when
[00:32:43] this patch came out I'm gonna scream we
[00:32:45] also just got defense I'm gonna scream
[00:32:46] twice
[00:32:48] what if I screamed a third time
[00:32:50] I'm just gonna
[00:33:01] please
[00:33:07] okay
[00:33:09] well I can still be good I guess copium
[00:33:21] okay we keep going
[00:33:24] Albedo peace yeah I mean Albedo can use
[00:33:27] the set that is true that actually is
[00:33:29] true it can be his bestest thought that
[00:33:32] is true
[00:33:36] okay we got energy recharge
[00:33:39] um
[00:33:46] [Music]
[00:33:49] this is certainly a piece of all time
[00:33:56] keep rolling it can still be good well I
[00:34:00] don't know about that one that is some
[00:34:02] next level copium but I mean maybe
[00:34:06] foreign
[00:34:27] I think on that defense role it's a good
[00:34:29] time to mention that this stream will be
[00:34:31] talking about the [ __ ] Visa infinite so a
[00:34:33] mini or Eclipse Visa infinite's amazing
[00:34:35] point system and stuff that we will go
[00:34:37] over in a little after the short thing
[00:34:39] that people prepared for us uh but we're
[00:34:41] gonna get this to plus 20 first because
[00:34:42] I could still use this on Albedo and if
[00:34:44] I'm gonna get a bad piece that I might
[00:34:45] as well get a good ad read in so there
[00:34:48] you go
[00:34:52] stop typing typing lament anytime we say
[00:34:55] short
[00:34:58] because someone making a mode for
[00:34:59] fuschwan because she's a lot shorter
[00:35:01] than
[00:35:02] the lamento mode

[00:43:09] that's free dude
[00:43:11] wait I forgot to do my reputation last
[00:43:12] week well I didn't forget but I like
[00:43:15] fell asleep
[00:43:19] wait how much or does it need wait let

[00:43:24] reputation I forgot nobody left nobody
[00:43:26] laughed nobody left
[00:43:28] oh
[00:43:29] I have it
[00:43:30] wait let's use it
[00:43:32] too much offer to be worth really wait
[00:43:35] which auras let's see let's see let's
[00:43:36] see let me check let me check oh I can
[00:43:38] use the parametric probably
[00:43:40] no we can't
[00:43:50] so 30 Crystal trunks or
[00:43:55] oh 30 of either so you could use just
[00:43:57] the medium ones
[00:43:59] oh a 31 white iron is easy
[00:44:03] because this Aura has a value of 10 yeah
[00:44:05] it's just dumb if you use this one
[00:44:07] because this one's also 10 so there's no
[00:44:08] reason to ever use the blue ones just
[00:44:09] use this one
[00:44:11] easy
[00:44:13] tet uh 30 white iron is is worth 15
[00:44:16] Crystal flies for sure if it's actually
[00:44:18] 15
[00:44:21] wait can I put it anywhere why did I put
[00:44:22] it here is this fine do I have to move

[01:11:46] like my human's loud or I'm loud with
[01:11:48] like friends but like
[01:11:50] in like a normal public setting I'm not

[01:15:06] but he looked more buff like arm wise
[01:15:09] thigh y like just build wise just his
[01:15:12] whole character looked more buff than

[01:18:57] things uh then wouldn't that be a great
[01:19:00] thing that this streamer could tell you
[01:19:01] about because I personally can think of
[01:19:04] of something like that that this
[01:19:06] streamer is talking about which is none
[01:19:08] other than the [ __ ] infinite Eclipse Visa

[01:21:02] it's him vouch all right dude look at
[01:21:06] this piece lose this piece you know what
[01:21:08] I'm not gonna jinx it but I'm just
[01:21:10] saying attack is good crit damage is
[01:21:12] good curry is good
[01:21:14] surely there's no way this piece is bad
[01:21:16] right I know me saying that might have
[01:21:18] jinxed it so I'm gonna wait so that it
[01:21:19] resets
[01:21:23] [Music]
[01:21:29] surely right
[01:21:38] I'm just making sure I'm in the right
[01:21:40] mind space headspace for this I'm making
[01:21:42] sure I'm in the right headspace
[01:21:50] look every single stat you guys see is
[01:21:53] amazing and even if let's say we play
[01:21:55] this on a HP scaling character then
[01:21:57] there's still two stats that we want
[01:22:03] so I don't know about you but I'm
[01:22:06] feeling 22.
[01:22:07] crit damage anything but
[01:22:11] of course it can spot the fence all
[01:22:15] right one more roll that's fine one one
[01:22:17] bad role is fine it's literally one okay
[01:22:19] all right okay I hate this game I
[01:22:22] actually hate this game okay
[01:22:24] um
[01:22:31] dude how am I this talented at getting
[01:22:34] bad rolls it actually makes no sense
[01:22:37] it's like it's like it's like I'm like
[01:22:39] I'm lucky at being unlucky
[01:22:41] I'm lucky at being a lucky Someone
[01:22:43] caught that but that was like my high
[01:22:44] school yearbook
[01:22:57] I'm sorry I didn't mean it again I was
[01:22:58] dying
[01:23:00] anyways where were we oh yeah 60 five
[01:23:02] defense

[01:23:12] that's good that's good that's good
[01:23:13] that's good that's good
[01:23:16] I mean okay did we still lose two rolls
[01:23:20] on flat defense yeah but it's still good
[01:23:22] it's like 10 10 in terms of like the
[01:23:24] crit stuff well it's more than 10 but
[01:23:27] you know like 34-ish crit value
[01:23:30] on top of attack percent it's actually
[01:23:32] not bad the attack percent rule helps it
[01:23:34] out quite a bit flat defense is is bad
[01:23:36] is is is is is far from idea why do I
[01:23:39] have one two three four five six seven
[01:23:43] battery she'll say flowers and like

[01:30:22] [Music]
[01:30:29] what's that do you think foreign
[01:30:32] how would I know we don't even know
[01:30:35] anything about our kid but I mean she's
[01:30:37] the Hydra archon so you know surely she
[01:30:39] uses the new sets that are made for the
[01:30:42] new Hydra region but we'll see
[01:30:44] we'll see we don't know
[01:30:46] we don't know who knows
[01:31:01] who will use nymph's dream
[01:31:11] someone someone will
[01:31:22] GPS Candace best slot
[01:31:30] even need to farm that can't child
[01:31:32] players just go to these two piece
[01:31:36] are child players getting out of going
[01:31:38] out of their way to go farm that surely
[01:31:40] not right
[01:31:47] child can just go emblem um you know
[01:31:50] that you know the most the Jeff cake
[01:31:52] that the Jeff is ever as a draft is you
[01:31:54] can go emblem stringless on child
[01:31:58] I mean you can you can just one shot
[01:32:00] Vape the burst you can
[01:32:04] [Music]
[01:32:08] also yeah
[01:32:17] the soon child's worth for more team
[01:32:19] comps
[01:32:22] I mean
[01:32:24] it's cool it doesn't usually change that
[01:32:27] much
[01:32:28] like it won't make him
[01:32:31] viable somewhere he isn't
[01:32:36] uh I guess if you're like trying to play
[01:32:39] it like usually his rotations are like
[01:32:42] pretty similar but you can stay a bit
[01:32:43] longer if you have C1
[01:32:46] um
[01:32:49] I guess it could help like let's say hi
[01:32:51] let's say hypothetically you like don't
[01:32:54] have ayato or kokomi and you want to
[01:32:55] play with like hyperbloom then maybe
[01:32:57] having someone can help because you get
[01:32:58] to be in your skill more often
[01:33:01] so it's like
[01:33:03] less annoying
[01:33:05] so that could be like you know
[01:33:10] but overall it's kind of whatever
[01:33:11] child's best constellation is like his
[01:33:13] C3 unironically
[01:33:26] are you excited for the Octo baby yes I
[01:33:27] am not pet looks insane like well I mean

[01:43:04] thankful don't say thanks to me because
[01:43:06] you are not welcome you are not matter
[01:43:08] of fact I wish you didn't get the sub
[01:43:14] strongly hold e
[01:43:17] use his alt for no reason
[01:43:25] foreign
[01:43:32] I feel it
[01:43:40] can I throw a pyro please
[01:43:47] it is Showtime
[01:43:52] what it's like one sec
[01:44:01] party in my water bottle but it actually
[01:44:02] hit that actually hit you guys slow
[01:44:04] motion that study that you actually
[01:44:06] can't teach aim like that
[01:44:10] why is the angle of our alts weird
[01:44:13] recently every time we've been bursting
[01:44:14] on linear that angle has been weird
[01:44:29] those good things helps your own channel
[01:44:30] Cost Less
[01:44:32] so I think
[01:44:35] if I give subscribe on channel twitch
[01:44:37] just takes
[01:44:39] however much of it
[01:44:40] and then so I'm basically just losing
[01:44:42] like I'll pay probably like half or some
[01:44:44] [ __ ] and then I also pay taxes so it's
[01:44:46] like
[01:44:48] I don't know why I would it's okay
[01:44:59] why is Lydia on hard why not I mean so
[01:45:02] usually with matters you'll see you
[01:45:03] might have too much criterate if you're
[01:45:04] on harp but um
[01:45:07] I don't have a good four piece man I
[01:45:08] should say yet so we're using heart I
[01:45:10] also don't have a crit damage though I
[01:45:12] should have pulled on the loss better
[01:45:37] it's okay
[01:45:39] it's okay we're gonna say again
[01:45:43] I'm lucky
[01:45:46] we have two resin
[01:45:50] it's actually show you another head
[01:45:51] piece okay assuming the version 4.1 live
[01:45:54] stream taught us anything and what from
[01:45:57] what we know we can guess that he might
[01:45:59] want to set we don't know uh we could
[01:46:02] have a good flower like one of these uh
[01:46:04] like one of these we could have because
[01:46:06] we know that he scales on like they
[01:46:08] mentioned that his eight-day scale on
[01:46:10] his HP he they mention it in the live
[01:46:12] stream not that way but the guy he was
[01:46:14] talking to I I think uh and they also
[01:46:16] mentioned that they would he would
[01:46:17] modify his HP and they also mentioned uh
[01:46:20] uh
[01:46:22] chargeback
[01:46:24] the day they did because I haven't I
[01:46:27] have no leaks here but we know this from
[01:46:29] the live stream we can guess it might
[01:46:31] not be true anyways so there's this it
[01:46:33] looks good uh this could be good this
[01:46:35] could be good but it has a lot of em I
[01:46:37] don't know if we're gonna need em on him
[01:46:38] if we don't then a piece like this or a
[01:46:40] piece like this
[01:46:41] uh Sans if we want HP boom this one
[01:46:44] looks good and then
[01:46:45] um Circle it
[01:46:48] circlet's a bit um I mean this is I mean
[01:46:52] you know 10 crit rate is what it is not
[01:46:54] amazing but it is what it is
[01:46:58] for five months appreciate it
[01:47:06] abandon the description HP damn you
[01:47:09] could probably if it's it's probably
[01:47:11] like a temporary one right or like a
[01:47:13] warning if you're like perm band just
[01:47:14] appeal it
[01:47:17] okay you're not allowed to talk about
[01:47:18] leaks so like I'm assuming mods are
[01:47:21] serious about that because you know I
[01:47:22] don't want to get bonked but like
[01:47:25] like don't talk about leaks but like the
[01:47:27] stuff that we can infer from the live
[01:47:29] stream is okay but you have to like it's
[01:47:31] a it's like a it's a fine line to walk I
