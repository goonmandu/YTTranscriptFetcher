[00:21:47] your child's actually pretty good uh
[00:21:49] although not to be that guy but leveling
[00:21:52] your normal attack to n eight when your
[00:21:55] [ __ ] like alhum skill is lower and
[00:21:57] that actually matters is kind of troll
[00:21:59] like you're kind of griefing but um 10
[00:22:01] and N is is based
[00:22:04] so yeah
[00:22:10] um yeah this account could be due for a
[00:22:12] fixing but for the most part gear your
[00:22:13] characters lovely talents uh your
[00:22:15] child's really good though and I assume
[00:22:16] he's your favorite character because of
[00:22:17] your profile picture and your
[00:22:22] bio so yeah anyways we're doing Builder
[00:22:25] later this is still the intro I just I I
[00:22:29] got unlocked okay anyways hello welcome
[00:22:31] to the stream Cole is enabled we're
[00:22:33] going to do the whle genal and then Yap
[00:22:35] for a bit and then we'll start doing
[00:22:43] it should s have an ER or attack sand it
[00:22:46] it's always it depends on what you need
[00:22:48] right if you're using sack sword and
[00:22:50] have emblem you basically need no more
[00:22:52] ER so you go attack s if you're running
[00:22:54] like Jade cutter or don't have enough ER
[00:22:57] then ER s it just depends on you need
[00:22:58] attack is more damage obviously but if
[00:23:00] you don't have enough ER like a lot of
[00:23:02] people won't have enough ER unless
[00:23:03] they're running an ER weapon like Sack
[00:23:04] or fav and then you could go
[00:23:07] attack so yeah all right we're going to
[00:23:09] start with the whle let me close

[01:00:24] e e
[01:01:04] okay I turn it
[01:01:19] off what is this team it's to give uh
[01:01:22] kakomi crit but she can still crit
[01:01:25] without it like we have 14 plus Mari so
[01:01:27] that's a lot and Rosaria but then you I
[01:01:30] just had that for a screenshot which I
[01:01:33] but usually our Ki team is this
[01:01:36] one I would do shenyun but ki's plunge
[01:01:39] doesn't actually scale with the HP so
[01:01:42] unfortunate for some reason they uh they
[01:01:44] thought plunge Comey would be too
[01:01:46] powerful so they nerfed it let's move
[01:01:48] out let's move
[01:01:50] out all right I think we um get ready
[01:01:53] let me claim my expeditions
[01:01:56] showcase stairs oh no wait you just

[01:02:05] well
[01:02:08] okay all right let me claim
[01:02:13] these dual scaling who
[01:02:18] kakomi it's not really dual scaling I
[01:02:22] mean kind of you can build her for her
[01:02:23] jellyfish damage true you go full attack
[01:02:26] for
[01:02:27] jellyfish I might I might Crown this I
[01:02:29] got this to eight off I got this to nine
[01:02:31] off stream it was eight I was 8 108 I
[01:02:33] got this to nine I might Crown
[01:02:34] it probably will it's just cuz it needs
[01:02:37] specters like I dude dude dude like like
[01:02:41] you think spects grow on [ __ ] Tre uh
[01:02:43] trees like what do you want from me
[01:02:46] they're
[01:02:51] hard but uh lowkey I might 100% Sarah's
[01:02:54] Island next and that island has a lot of
[01:02:57] uh specters so I'll probably get some
[01:02:58] like this place cuz we already did the
[01:03:00] [ __ ] cringe puzzle so we might as
[01:03:01] well do the
[01:03:07] rest Triple Crown the queen true but
[01:03:10] like her dude I I don't I don't I love
[01:03:13] Ki but like I just press e and swap out
[01:03:16] so I don't need to give her damage but
[01:03:18] we're we're going to play kcom so I
[01:03:19] might Crown her normals or her burst or
[01:03:22] both uh
[01:03:24] anyways bro hates Inazuma so much I
[01:03:27] don't hate it it's like why would I go

[01:04:21] is
[01:04:21] fasting best of I don't know what the
[01:04:24] proper thing to say is that I think in

[01:04:29] luck with
[01:04:43] that oh is it the wrong word my
[01:04:47] bad people tell say you're a fake fan
[01:04:49] what for not crowning
[01:04:53] kakomi dude well first of all she is
[01:04:55] Crown second of all she doesn't deal
[01:04:57] dude I love I don't need to I did Crown
[01:05:01] her and I do love her but you don't need
[01:05:03] to you don't need to you know like like
[01:05:05] like there's you can love a character
[01:05:07] without chucking three crowns on them
[01:05:09] but I swear I would the only thing
[01:05:11] stopping me isn't the crowns it's the
[01:05:12] [ __ ] specters [ __ ] the
[01:05:15] specters but I will I will she will be
[01:05:17] [ __ ] crowns she will
[01:05:21] be okay
[01:05:24] chhat [ __ ] it tier list
[01:05:27] time oh sh I was making a fourar tier
[01:05:29] list [ __ ] I have to reset it

[01:05:37] tier look this is the D tier
[01:05:41] spoilers all right anyways my
[01:05:44] bad
[01:05:47] um Chong Yun capital D colon yeah but I
[01:05:51] don't like see I did it off stream so I
[01:05:53] don't have to argue with [ __ ] like
[01:05:54] I don't want to have to expl explain my
[01:05:55] reasoning that's why I did off stream I
[01:05:57] don't have to talk to the [ __ ] five
[01:05:59] Chong Yun Mains about why Chong yun's
[01:06:00] actually good I don't I listen I don't
[01:06:03] care boo I'm
[01:06:05] sorry he's not
[01:06:11] useless
[01:06:12] but I think I put spoilers I put Rosaria
[01:06:16] and Kaa in a and usually it's like why
[01:06:18] would you pick another cry option when
[01:06:20] you have them unless you need like Lila
[01:06:22] or
[01:06:23] something that's the main thing it's not
[01:06:26] like Chong yun's particularly bad it's
[01:06:27] just the other crowds are so [ __ ]
[01:06:31] good um but I guess he enables DPS
[01:06:33] Bennett which is a good team if you want
[01:06:35] to play DPS Bennett but um
[01:06:40] anyways let me reset

[01:08:36] then we'll
[01:08:37] decide kazua gameplay wise but not like
[01:08:41] I don't know what we're even I don't
[01:08:42] even know what I'm talking about is this
[01:08:43] like like like everything included like
[01:08:46] lore and visuals and gameplay I don't
[01:08:49] even know what I'm
[01:08:52] ranking 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
[01:08:58] like I'm going to be honest I think
[01:08:59] rizle visually I like him more than
[01:09:01] nevet but I like nevet as a character
[01:09:03] more cuz he's like a [ __ ] Hydro
[01:09:05] Dragon sick as [ __ ] but like I think
[01:09:07] rizle is like
[01:09:20] cooler you're wrong socks what do you
[01:09:23] mean I'm wrong
[01:09:25] wait have I put a single four star wait
[01:09:27] I'm only using five stars wait a second
[01:09:29] I actually really like Fel but I don't
[01:09:31] know if she's up there with
[01:09:36] them
[01:09:40] um no y okay we'll put them in the same
[01:09:44] tier wait who's my favorite four
[01:09:48] star dude will you get mad at me okay I
[01:09:52] would unironically say B if she didn't
[01:09:54] have a coun I know this is skill issue
[01:09:57] but I think V is like dude I love B but
[01:10:01] like I hate counter I hate
[01:10:08] parrying um it is a skill issue
[01:10:16] though I think I like cut more than
[01:10:18] honestly I think cut and finina are
[01:10:20] similar for me
[01:10:29] why is soo there dude okay Soo visually
[01:10:32] is one of my favorites but like
[01:10:34] sometimes I can't be [ __ ] to like
[01:10:37] dude like I'll height them just feel
[01:10:40] smoother to play so I end up using
[01:10:42] alamore but like visually I really like
[01:10:44] Soo he [ __ ]
[01:10:50] Anubis what about de dude they [ __ ]

[01:11:18] damn I mean Kazo is mostly just for
[01:11:21] gameplay though
[01:11:23] like I feel like I would put a random
[01:11:26] Electro character there over him just
[01:11:28] like V
[01:11:30] like character design wise
[01:11:37] but don't you dare I'm

[01:20:01] though wait c0 deluke but C6
[01:20:05] Jia
[01:20:14] Dam I respect
[01:20:17] it uh also just to get this out the way
[01:20:21] because I I don't want to wait till I
[01:20:23] stream star rail to say this uh about
[01:20:25] the acaron stuff
[01:20:56] so uh yeah I mean I told you guys last
[01:20:58] stream like I also have played acaron I
[01:21:01] just don't like to rush videos cuz like
[01:21:03] I don't like I'm always in a weird like
[01:21:05] mixed feeling with things like this
[01:21:07] where it's like so if you guys don't
[01:21:09] know some people have early access to a
[01:21:12] character uh but not
[01:21:14] everyone and I know a lot of games do
[01:21:18] that where like ride games for example
[01:21:19] to like let like valerant streamers test
[01:21:21] a new character out [ __ ] like that um so
[01:21:24] it's not like it's not it's not like
[01:21:25] it's a new thing um and I think the goal
[01:21:27] is to combat leaks what I personally
[01:21:30] there's some stuff I dislike some stuff
[01:21:32] I like uh personally what I dislike is
[01:21:35] that I assume they're like it's like
[01:21:37] they're like rolling it out to like a
[01:21:39] few people and then it's going to be
[01:21:39] more but I don't like that it's not a
[01:21:41] lot of people that's just me personally
[01:21:43] you don't have to listen to my opinion
[01:21:45] uh and that's one and two is that um you
[01:21:50] can't react to it which I don't like um
[01:21:55] I I'm pretty sure you can't react to
[01:21:56] videos that people make from that
[01:21:59] server um I wish you could
[01:22:03] personally uh I think that's one thing
[01:22:05] as
[01:22:06] well
[01:22:08] and yeah think posting early guys help
[01:22:11] people from wasting money
[01:22:13] yes um no negative reviews scratch no
[01:22:16] that's not true and people know that's
[01:22:17] not true it's been debunked like
[01:22:19] everyone knows that's not true people
[01:22:20] that think it's not true are just lying
[01:22:22] uh or maybe they're misinformed what it
[01:22:24] is and like I talked about this on fob
[01:22:26] stream every time I work with Hoover
[01:22:28] both for star and genin every time I
[01:22:31] make it clear even before I ever worked
[01:22:33] with them ever right um I made it clear
[01:22:36] that like if I ever review a character
[01:22:38] or make a video or do anything I'm
[01:22:40] allowed to [ __ ] on the character or like
[01:22:42] call them bad or do anything like that
[01:22:45] the only thing that I can't do is like
[01:22:47] in a sponsored thing or like a official
[01:22:50] like hoyo thing hoyo Creator whatever I
[01:22:53] can't slander like slanderous like I
[01:22:55] can't be like this company or like this
[01:22:56] thing like I I could say like this is
[01:22:58] bad or this sucks but I can't like do
[01:23:00] anything that would be
[01:23:02] like legally slanderous right like that
[01:23:05] makes sense in my opinion um and I I did
[01:23:08] this before ever like agreeing to work
[01:23:10] with them because if for example like I
[01:23:12] said this I'm like I value
[01:23:15] my credibility more than anything and if
[01:23:18] for example a character is bad and I
[01:23:21] can't say they're bad I wouldn't want to
[01:23:23] do anything with like I would I would
[01:23:25] quit like I would do something else I
[01:23:26] would say they're bad and part my way
[01:23:28] like I would do it my like you know um
[01:23:31] so I I made sure that was clear and and
[01:23:32] that's always how it's been and I assume
[01:23:34] that's always how it will be
[01:23:37] um but for this what is
[01:23:40] new Rox v on it yeah I know I didn't
[01:23:43] watch it all but I know um but yeah for
[01:23:46] this what is what is new is that it's
[01:23:48] like earlier like videos can be released
[01:23:50] like a week before the character's out
[01:23:52] me personally this is my controversial
[01:23:54] take but I don't want anyone to be
[01:23:55] parting this cuz I don't know if I'm
[01:23:56] right and I don't uh like you know want
[01:23:59] to anyways uh my personal take is I
[01:24:02] enjoyed the simpler times when it was
[01:24:05] like character comes out no one knows
[01:24:07] what the [ __ ] the character does
[01:24:08] everyone plays them together and
[01:24:09] everyone like I figure it out day one
[01:24:11] and it's not like day one I have to know
[01:24:12] everything or like chat calls me dumb
[01:24:15] now characters out I know everything
[01:24:16] about them like literally I could tell
[01:24:18] you how to build Aron I could tell you
[01:24:20] how to build okay I can tell you how to
[01:24:22] build chori like 5 days before chori
[01:24:23] came or not days like two days before CH
[01:24:25] came out all right and like that's not a
[01:24:28] bad thing like especially like I get
[01:24:30] that they want to combat leaks and we
[01:24:32] don't cover them on this channel but
[01:24:34] personally like this is me not talking
[01:24:36] as an official Creator I understand why
[01:24:39] the average person is like hey this lets
[01:24:41] me save my Primos if I see who's coming
[01:24:42] and if I see if they're good like I've
[01:24:44] never personally I haven't got involved
[01:24:45] with that [ __ ] cuz I don't care like I
[01:24:47] don't care like I get why it's
[01:24:49] beneficial to people and I get why the
[01:24:50] company doesn't like it so sure um so I
[01:24:54] assume this is to combat leaks I don't
[01:24:57] know what it's for or to like let
[01:24:59] certain content creators release stuff
[01:25:00] early people get to see it get hyped um
[01:25:02] and that's all fine like I'm not here to
[01:25:05] be the like Arbiter of Justice if you
[01:25:06] like that if you don't like that that's
[01:25:07] completely up to you personally my
[01:25:09] initial reaction to that is I kind of
[01:25:12] wish we all just had the character day
[01:25:14] won but I understand that regardless
[01:25:17] like let's say that were the case let's
[01:25:18] say there was nothing early what would
[01:25:20] it be it would be okay everyone gets a
[01:25:21] character day one but every every guid
[01:25:23] maker has to look at Le leaks or they
[01:25:25] can't make a guide like that's what it
[01:25:26] would be right like like I know this
[01:25:30] because sometimes it's like well I want
[01:25:31] to be ready for a character to come out
[01:25:32] but if I can't play the character well
[01:25:34] I'm [ __ ] like going in an Excel
[01:25:36] spreadsheet or looking at other people
[01:25:38] going in an Excel spreadsheet before the
[01:25:39] character's out so anyways
[01:25:44] um yeah um personally I mean I said this
[01:25:47] like I had access to acaron and I will
[01:25:50] make a video on it at some point um but
[01:25:52] I didn't rush one out because
[01:25:55] I don't know like
[01:25:57] I I've never been like that with guides
[01:26:00] also like I'm usually later than people
[01:26:02] um it's not it's mostly like a my fault
[01:26:05] thing I just don't like I don't like the
[01:26:09] like I like making guides to help people
[01:26:12] but I don't like making guides when it
[01:26:13] feels like it's a race like it's like
[01:26:15] it's not about sometimes it feels like
[01:26:17] it's not about being right but it's
[01:26:18] about being first and I don't like that
[01:26:20] which is why I'm grateful that you guys
[01:26:21] watch me even when I'm late and delayed
[01:26:23] like
[01:26:24] my finina video or my whoever guide
[01:26:27] video came out probably two days after
[01:26:28] the other person's but you guys still
[01:26:30] watch mine you still watch them like I
[01:26:31] want you to watch other creators too
[01:26:32] like nothing wrong with them but I don't
[01:26:35] want like it's it annoys me when I feel
[01:26:38] like uh and I know a lot of people share
[01:26:40] this feeling like I feel like I need to
[01:26:41] get it out minute one and the reason why
[01:26:44] something like that annoys me is cuz I
[01:26:46] am very very anal about getting things
[01:26:48] right like I [ __ ] up my albo guide in
[01:26:52] version 1.3 when he first came out and I
[01:26:54] still think about that and it still like
[01:26:56] hurts me like and since then I would
[01:26:59] like to think I haven't made like a big
[01:27:00] mistake but like I still think about
[01:27:02] that like at night I'll be like how did
[01:27:03] I say that like it still like haunts
[01:27:06] me
[01:27:09] um uh so now I'm very like example let
[01:27:13] me show you an example let me pull out
[01:27:15] my YouTube
[01:27:16] Studio let me pull up my YouTube
[01:27:21] Studio you guys want to see something
[01:27:22] funny
[01:27:30] chori complete chor guide complete your
[01:27:32] guide complete four I have to react with
[01:27:34] this four times for like 3 seconds of
[01:27:37] change Sparkle Sparkle Sparkle Shia Shia
[01:27:39] Shia Nikita Nikita Black Swan Black Swan
[01:27:42] shenyun shenyun and then the videos that
[01:27:44] are less like you know like who should
[01:27:46] you choose this is less like super
[01:27:47] edited like I'm chilling right
[01:27:50] sh it's a lot of this right so um
[01:27:56] yeah I mean Nita I think I [ __ ] up
[01:27:59] with the Nita video because I I I I
[01:28:01] misspoke and I said like skill instead
[01:28:02] of burst I said her burst extends the
[01:28:04] duration of your mark or a hydro
[01:28:07] character extends the duration of your
[01:28:08] mark instead of burst which is the real
[01:28:09] thing and instead of pinning a comment I
[01:28:11] like cut it out so it sounds
[01:28:13] weird
[01:28:15] anyways that not to self glaze but my
[01:28:18] point is like um with a lot of these
[01:28:21] things she doesn't use Baron bunny she
[01:28:23] unleashes is berry bunny from rezero
[01:28:26] what oh great bunnies I don't know who
[01:28:27] that is anyways
[01:28:29] um please stop stalling I'm sorry but
[01:28:31] yeah point is um I don't like rushing
[01:28:35] content personally but I think that's
[01:28:37] inevitable if you make videos like this
[01:28:40] um so i'
[01:28:42] like i' like that I like that um they're
[01:28:48] trying to give people kind of earlier
[01:28:51] access for more time and to I guess
[01:28:54] combat leaks but also I don't I would
[01:28:57] hope that it's rolled out to a lot more
[01:28:59] people and not like a select few because
[01:29:00] when I heard of it I'm like first of all
[01:29:03] me personally I would just like to see
[01:29:05] the character day one and then figure it
[01:29:06] out like that but I feel like that's
[01:29:07] never going to happen and second of all
[01:29:09] if I'm like a small Creator which I was
[01:29:12] well I'm not now but um I don't want it
[01:29:15] to feel I don't want to be de
[01:29:17] incentivized decent of whatever the word
[01:29:19] is to be like hey I want to Theory craft
[01:29:22] hey I want to like look into this
[01:29:23] character right
[01:29:24] um I feel like most people that
[01:29:28] do um that stuff end up looking at it
[01:29:34] pre-release but I
[01:29:36] wish I don't know I wish that was more
[01:29:39] helped like I wish Theory Crafters that
[01:29:43] want to help people
[01:29:46] out before a character is released don't
[01:29:50] have to do it through leaks and could do
[01:29:53] it through like a officially Le CU like
[01:29:55] I wish the information was out a bit
[01:29:57] before and I get that that's never going
[01:29:58] to happen but I wish like Theory
[01:30:00] Crafters don't have to be like well you
[01:30:03] can't be a Hoo creater because you're
[01:30:04] looking at leaks instead they could look
[01:30:05] at like official stuff and like cuz I
[01:30:07] again value people being correct about
[01:30:09] information more than just being Fast
[01:30:11] And so there's a lot of overlap there
[01:30:14] because a lot of times I feel like I try
[01:30:16] not to look at leaks and I don't but if
[01:30:20] I don't get the character early and
[01:30:21] everyone is like looking at a character
[01:30:23] before they come out what can I do to
[01:30:25] get my guide video out early so often
[01:30:26] times I delay it um but anyways it's
[01:30:29] fine
[01:30:31] um yeah regarding acon though uh I'm
[01:30:34] probably going to release just like a
[01:30:35] review me playing her what I think uh
[01:30:37] sometime maybe
[01:30:39] tomorrow hopefully you guys like it
[01:30:44] um I think that's it I don't really have
[01:30:46] anything else to
[01:30:47] say but uh yeah yeah yeah I just know
[01:30:52] some people are mad some people are not
[01:30:53] mad so that is I don't know I don't
[01:30:55] really know what to think but obviously
[01:30:57] don't be mad at content creators like be
[01:30:58] mad at whoever you want to be mad at if
[01:31:00] you're mad at like hoyo you could do
[01:31:02] that but don't be mad at like the people
[01:31:03] that are like cuz like if you get
[01:31:05] approached with an offer as a content
[01:31:06] creator you're not going to like you're
[01:31:08] not going to be like no actually [ __ ]
[01:31:10] you well sometimes I do that actually a
[01:31:12] lot but you know sometimes you don't and
[01:31:15] like I wouldn't fault someone for not
[01:31:16] doing
[01:31:17] that and I don't like I didn't like I'm
[01:31:20] probably going to make a video on acon
[01:31:21] so
[01:31:29] W but also it was
[01:31:31] like you
[01:31:37] know it's also like let's say I'm
[01:31:40] chilling and then I'm like oh yeah I'll
[01:31:43] make an acon guy when she's out and then
[01:31:44] someone in my chat's like oh well
[01:31:45] there's five acon guys out now a week
[01:31:47] early and like let's say you don't have
[01:31:49] access to her like I do let say you
[01:31:51] don't it kind of it might feel like oh
[01:31:52] [ __ ] like what's the point of even
[01:31:53] trying and like I feel for that because
[01:31:55] I feel that a lot a lot of times I know
[01:31:57] people would watch me for me but like
[01:31:58] I'll be like okay I want to talk about
[01:31:59] this new weapon and then eight people
[01:32:01] made a video on it and I'm like I don't
[01:32:02] want it to look like I'm copying them or
[01:32:03] I'm just saying what they said or like
[01:32:06] what's the point of even talking a lot
[01:32:07] and then I just don't make the video
[01:32:08] like that happens to me a lot um so I
[01:32:13] feel for for people um but I mean I'm
[01:32:16] chilling either way
[01:32:18] so yeah I don't
[01:32:21] know anyways the guide 13.5 seconds down
[01:32:24] with a 50 energy cost that's a pretty
[01:32:26] decent burst illus
[01:32:29] heart the lot guide isn't that hard dude
[01:32:32] [ __ ]
[01:32:33] you okay deluk guide unironically it's
[01:32:35] happening but it's so hard for me to
[01:32:37] find a cool like
[01:32:42] um okay
[01:32:52] yo okay I found my my words chatter
[01:32:54] anyways
[01:32:57] um what was I saying oh yeah the hardest
[01:32:59] part of duuke is finding the like
[01:33:01] thumbnail text cuz Okay I'm still making
[01:33:04] the guide it'll be out at some point but
[01:33:06] dude it's like he has okay let's say
[01:33:09] character has a really good new build I
[01:33:10] like oh really good new build insane new
[01:33:12] build like awesome new build but him
[01:33:13] it's like a team and it's like if you
[01:33:15] don't have that team he's like whatever
[01:33:17] and if you have that team he's like
[01:33:18] pretty insane so it's like so do
[01:33:20] polarizing
[01:33:25] but
[01:33:28] yeah deluke is question
[01:33:32] mark the Luger's back like Aron C1 oh my
[01:33:37] God don't get me started dude dude thank
[01:33:41] you for being honest I I started
[01:33:43] recording appreciate you vermillian I
[01:33:45] started recording I started talking
[01:33:47] about Aron and and uh Allan my editor he
[01:33:50] DM me I DM like dude do you think I talk
[01:33:52] about her S1 too she's like you
[01:33:54] mentioned like eight times but I think
[01:33:56] it's good to hammer the point in so like
[01:33:58] okay
[01:34:00] dude there are some characters whose S1
[01:34:03] is really good but like bro what the
[01:34:05] [ __ ] is your dude I don't even have good
[01:34:07] night and sleep well superimposed what
[01:34:09] the [ __ ] do I do I might as well [ __ ]
[01:34:12] good night and sleep forever in
[01:34:20] game it's yeah um um but like I also
[01:34:25] personally want like there are two
[01:34:27] demons inside of me one of them is like
[01:34:29] [ __ ] any character that doesn't have a
[01:34:30] free to play option and then the other
[01:34:31] is well you don't not every character
[01:34:33] needs to be free to play friendly so
[01:34:35] they both of those demons kind of fight
[01:34:36] each other and then they
[01:34:39] kiss
[01:34:43] anyways allow me I don't have my skill
[01:35:05] okay we can get ready to review stuff
[01:35:07] we'll pick which uh which uh
[01:35:10] region Court of font
[01:35:15] Le I think I'm going to upload this I
[01:35:18] think we're going to I'm going to review
[01:35:19] accounts for like an hour and I'm going
[01:35:21] to upload it to either my main or second
[01:35:23] Channel and just like basically unedited
[01:35:25] just [ __ ] it just reviewing builds for
[01:35:27] like 45
[01:35:28] minutes as always Clippers you can use
[01:35:31] Clips but don't y the entire segment
[01:35:32] please thank you I love you okay thanks
[01:35:34] that's all okay
[01:35:38] sorry
[01:35:44] um okay here's how we're going to do
[01:35:46] this I'm literally a mathematician in
[01:35:48] order to pick which region we're going
[01:35:49] to do we're going to do a poll to see
[01:35:52] which Region's most popular chat and
[01:35:54] then we're going to spin a weighted a
[01:35:56] wheel with weighted odds so let's say
[01:35:58] it's like like two four like two two two
[01:36:01] two two fifths one two fifths another
[01:36:04] and then one fifth the other then we'll
[01:36:06] roll like with two squares of the pi
[01:36:09] twoy in a simple and pragmatic way which
[01:36:13] region review na EU
[01:36:18] Asia elen
[01:36:22] ring about pick
[01:36:24] me if we get na I'll do a review of your
[01:36:30] uid damn so many EU people are
[01:36:40] awake to survive hardship and is asleep
[01:36:43] Dam I'm I guess I'm the only awake one
[01:36:46] cuz it's Monday wait what it's not
[01:36:47] Monday oh midday it's [ __ ] midday bro
[01:36:51] it's [ __ ] midday
[01:37:00] [Music]
[01:37:02] sorry phing EU even though I don't want
[01:37:04] to review bro what are you doing you are
[01:37:07] why are you Peter Griffin gaming it's
[01:37:10] hump day dude
[01:37:14] what are you okay
[01:37:23] zag it's okay I can do it I can include
[01:37:26] you at the end of the review however
[01:37:28] it's not even guaranteed to be EU where
[01:37:29] we're spitting a weighted wheel cuz it's
[01:37:32] a gotcha game so we have to gotcha the
[01:37:33] reviews wheel of
[01:37:36] probabilities
[01:37:40] spin adjustable
[01:37:42] spinner what the [ __ ] is
[01:37:47] this bro
[01:37:49] um [ __ ] how do I change the odd
[01:37:54] it won't let
[01:37:55] [Music]
[01:38:09] me okay chat listen listen to this okay
[01:38:13] so 40% we're going to round a Asia to
[01:38:16] 40% as well cuz 38 40 40 20 right okay
[01:38:20] here's what we're going to do
[01:38:28] here's what we going to
[01:38:34] do 40 4020 we're going to roll yolon
[01:38:39] dice Asia and EU are going to have two
[01:38:41] numbers each and na is going to have one
[01:38:44] number and then the last number is going
[01:38:46] to be a scam
[01:38:55] okay a okay okay we're going to do this
[01:38:57] in order na is
[01:38:59] one EU is
[01:39:02] 23 Asia is 45 that makes sense it's 40
[01:39:06] 4020 that makes sense cuz 442 is the
[01:39:09] same as one two two which are the same
[01:39:12] odds true so one two two so so na is one
[01:39:17] EU is two or three Asia is four or five
[01:39:20] six and stream
[01:39:32] yolan please choose the region we will
[01:39:34] review
[01:39:39] today should EU have three since I had
[01:39:41] the most yeah but it was the most by
[01:39:43] like one like
[01:39:48] 2% okay if it's six it's EU as well but
[01:39:51] I'll probably scam EU so it's fine if
[01:39:53] it's six it's it's EU but I end
[01:40:02] stream [ __ ] all well boys I'm
[01:40:06] sorry boys I'm
[01:40:10] sorry how did na
[01:40:14] win no way na
[01:40:18] won no [ __ ] way wait there's no na
[01:40:21] frogs awake though that's kind of
[01:40:31] scamming okay chat here's what we'll do
[01:40:34] I'm a fair man we'll do na for 30
[01:40:38] minutes and then whatever the second
[01:40:39] dice roll is is the region we'll go to
[01:40:42] for the second thing we'll start with Na
[01:40:44] and then whatever this rolls two or
[01:40:46] three EU four
[01:40:49] five 5,492
[01:40:55] okay one to three EU four to five uh
[01:40:59] four to six
[01:41:03] Asia for the second

[01:51:12] but let's see this is good this is
[01:51:14] really good also really good that's a
[01:51:17] lot of er which you can
[01:51:20] use that's good zero em yeah I don't
[01:51:23] know if you're playing melt or not if
[01:51:25] you are some melt sub stats is a a good
[01:51:27] idea but it's hard to tell what team
[01:51:29] you're playing
[01:51:32] um this is definitely a circlet of all
[01:51:34] time uh let's look at your CR rate
[01:51:38] yeah it's not bad but you're overcapping
[01:51:41] 74 plus 36 ding ding ding that's over
[01:51:45] 100 um it's actually 110 so yeah but
[01:51:49] it's still good I would just try to get
[01:51:50] less crit rate more attack percent or em
[01:51:53] if you're melting uh crit uh uh crit
[01:51:55] damage but yeah still good still good
[01:51:58] what about your ala if this is a crit
[01:52:01] rate Circ like the last guy we saw
[01:52:02] before starting I will okay good crit
[01:52:04] rate did I say crit rate I meant to say
[01:52:05] if it's crit damage uh these
[01:52:16] subst wait
[01:52:22] you are bursting and critting once a
[01:52:25] year it's not that bad though it's a
[01:52:28] work in progress I would just recommend
[01:52:29] a bit of crit rate a bit of energy
[01:52:30] recharge that's all that's all it is
[01:52:32] hard though I know this I'm an alhy
[01:52:33] player it's really hard to get enough
[01:52:35] crit rate on lowii because you have so
[01:52:36] much crit damage I understand
[01:52:39] that uh I will do the
[01:52:42] review holy [ __ ] like four like three

[01:55:38] this actually perfect okay perfect
[01:55:40] flower this is looking good so
[01:55:42] far very good feather no crit raate but
[01:55:45] 20 defense uh almost 30 crit damage and
[01:55:47] ER is insane
[01:55:50] sense sorry dude what's wrong with you
[01:55:53] be nice um crystallize so Gio fun fact
[01:55:56] doesn't actually have reactions uh
[01:55:58] crystallize the only thing that em does
[01:56:00] for crystallized is make the shield
[01:56:01] stronger so unfortunate but it's still
[01:56:03] not bad right even if you remove the Em
[01:56:06] still not bad
[01:56:07] um still not
[01:56:10] bad pretty good goblet pretty good
[01:56:13] goblet ciret last piece don't let me
[01:56:18] down it's okay it's okay your flower and
[01:56:21] feather though are insane
[01:56:22] especially your flower insane uh 2.7k
[01:56:25] defense 7667 122 good very good EO very
[01:56:29] goodto especially if you're free to play
[01:56:31] which means less like resin to spend on
[01:56:33] artifacts because you're spending resin
[01:56:34] on like other stuff and you can't
[01:56:35] refresh and all that I respect it I
[01:56:38] respect it very good
[01:56:41] detail good for free play even good for
[01:56:43] whale though like those are just good
[01:56:44] artifacts you know I'll do one more chat
[01:56:46] this guy said review my yolan or I'll
[01:56:48] bite you please don't bite me please
[01:56:49] don't bite me uh Cameo their bio is is
[01:56:52] women I agree uh let's look at
[01:56:56] yolon yolan is on an aqua simulakra
[01:56:59] C2 emblem of severed fate and triple
[01:57:03] crowned now uh I will not repeat what I
[01:57:06] said about people who Triple Crown
[01:57:08] characters that don't need the triple
[01:57:10] crowning um however I respect it let's
[01:57:14] look at your
[01:57:16] flower okay that is crit rate okay
[01:57:19] feather okay yeah that's fair that makes
[01:57:21] sense
[01:57:22] that's good that's very good
[01:57:26] Sans that's actually good cuz HP is good
[01:57:29] on you lot I took some time to process
[01:57:30] that that's good that's a good sense
[01:57:33] goblet also good ciret also no it's good
[01:57:38] 12% crit rate is a lot the other sub
[01:57:40] stats are [ __ ] useless but 12% crit
[01:57:41] rate is a lot you have
[01:57:57] okay very good yolon um I will say
[01:58:00] though you probably want more crit rate
[01:58:02] um your HP is a bit low but I assume
[01:58:05] like there's you might play a hydro
[01:58:06] resonance team and then you could
[01:58:08] probably get like 30k or something um
[01:58:11] well it would be what Hydro resence is
[01:58:12] like 20% 10 20% of this yeah cuz 10% is
[01:58:16] like two and then 20% like 4K so it' be
[01:58:19] around 30 um
[01:58:22] but Aqua passive also yeah also that
[01:58:25] yeah no I think it's I think it's good
[01:58:26] but your low crit rate so I would just
[01:58:28] try to get maybe uh it's really good
[01:58:29] like overall really good I could shut
[01:58:31] the [ __ ] up there but if you're trying
[01:58:33] to optimize this feather's insane but I
[01:58:35] would try to get one with crit and then
[01:58:36] use this on someone else like obviously
[01:58:37] this feather is really good but uh you
[01:58:39] can use like look at this oh that's only
[01:58:42] six gr rate do you have Emo on anyone
[01:58:46] else tough luck youa okay anyways good
[01:58:50] pretty good y uh is it Time 1 seconds to
[01:58:53] death I don't want to scam
[01:58:56] donos can donated that this the Melt
[01:58:59] gone you I'm using okay sure let's look
[01:59:01] at this why are you using melt G for
[01:59:03] cellia though cellia has like 70ish per
[01:59:07] Crow resistance I think 70 uh I really
[01:59:10] don't recommend G against that boss
[01:59:13] especially I mean that's a good weapon
[01:59:18] um that's a good cirit
[01:59:22] that's a good
[01:59:24] goblet that's a really good
[01:59:27] Sans that's a really good feather that's
[01:59:30] a really good
[01:59:32] flower but you still can't clear
[01:59:34] capellia
[01:59:36] so like no disrespect I I love I love G
[01:59:39] very good build but you're saying you
[01:59:42] can't clear capellia
[01:59:44] so I mean Crown your normals that'll
[01:59:48] help skill issue it might be a skill
[01:59:50] issue honestly at that point I would
[01:59:52] recommend either investing in your Shang
[01:59:54] Ling in that team or making sure you
[01:59:56] double swirl with Kaza uh or at least
[01:59:58] swirl cryo so that you're doing a lot
[02:00:00] more damage cuz like she has high
[02:00:01] resistance so you want to make sure you
[02:00:02] actually swirl I don't know what team
[02:00:04] you're running though but um it's a good
[02:00:06] G you it's a good G
[02:00:10] you okay let me do uh we'll do the deps
[02:00:13] account Z what character do you
[02:00:16] want let's look at your Hut wait I know
[02:00:18] your Hut if this is still on [ __ ]
[02:00:19] favonius don't talk to oh Dragon B wait
[02:00:22] this good actually this good Dragon B is
[02:00:23] good mag say very good uh with finina of
[02:00:27] course that's 20% HP that's
[02:00:31] good oh that's crit rate that's good
[02:00:33] that's good I was going to say mid but
[02:00:34] that's crit rate so it's actually good
[02:00:36] uh Sans nice that's a good Sans em Sans
[02:00:39] wait em Sans with dragon
[02:00:41] B how much em do you have
[02:00:45] 510 I mean it's it's fine uh Shan Yun oh
[02:00:49] wait what are you doing pogo stick oh I
[02:00:51] see I it makes sense no that makes sense
[02:00:54] of shenon shenyun scales better with
[02:00:56] your character's damage bonuses and like
[02:00:57] em like with reactions like vaporiz or
[02:00:59] mou uh because of the way her icy quills
[02:01:02] that aren't actually icy quills work and
[02:01:03] how they work it's basically additive to
[02:01:05] your attack or HP but multiplicative to
[02:01:07] your damage bonus sources
[02:01:10] anyways uh very good let's look at your
[02:01:14] goblet dude that's good but it's funny
[02:01:17] how much em you have it's good but it's
[02:01:18] funny how much em you have but it's good
[02:01:20] but it's funny how much em you have um
[02:01:23] good ciret let's
[02:01:27] looke it's not bad it's actually not bad
[02:01:31] but like bro get some crit rate what are
[02:01:33] you
[02:01:36] doing like it's good it's actually good
[02:01:38] but gets some crit
[02:01:41] rate I guess shenyun gives some let's
[02:01:43] say shenyun gives you 10 wait you have
[02:01:45] Mar shose am I [ __ ] stupid dude why
[02:01:47] do I even sit in front of a webcam and
[02:01:49] talk like am I dumb

[02:01:56] dude who stop singing sorry let let me
[02:02:00] re reiterate pretend cut that out uh oh
[02:02:02] Mar that means you have extra crit rate
[02:02:04] wow 80 195 with a lot of em that's very
[02:02:07] good normally I'd recommend more HP with
[02:02:09] this much em but if you're playing shun
[02:02:10] which I know you are uh that works good
[02:02:12] job is that better did I pass sorry
[02:02:18] finina next character D for
[02:02:26] okay this is actually optimal with nevet
[02:02:29] but please don't talk to me please don't

[02:02:34] kaching lion's roar actually you know a
[02:02:37] decent weapon

[02:03:04] good feather oh I was right this is
[02:03:06] actually really good though very good uh

[02:11:02] twopiece triple
[02:11:04] ground also you know my theory about how
[02:11:08] every offset Maiden piece is the best
[02:11:09] piece you've ever seen that applies to
[02:11:11] Blood Stained as well this Blood Stained

[02:11:14] watch yeah that's [ __ ] 17 crit rate

[02:11:24] master I would offer you a kaching
[02:11:26] review but then you'd realize my AO

[02:11:41] decent enough crit good feather good
[02:11:47] flower no we
[02:11:49] are but I actually think think ER is a
[02:11:52] liberal propaganda the government wants
[02:11:54] you to build ER because me personally
[02:11:56] you have C1 as well I genuinely think
[02:11:59] sha often times will need like 20 ER 20
[02:12:01] to 30 or 40 but especially W and
[02:12:04] especially in his new team with Shan Yun
[02:12:06] C6 Faron and Farina and you can even fa
[02:12:08] your finina and farizon you actually end
[02:12:10] up not needing much so I respect it you

[02:12:15] respect it it's a good show like my sh's
[02:12:17] on 120 ER so people don't laugh at me

[02:26:33] I said I would last na account last one
[02:26:35] this better be good
[02:26:37] chat don't let me
[02:26:42] down even at c64 troop is better I'm I
[02:26:45] remember doing the M or like looking
[02:26:47] into it before she came out and I'm
[02:26:50] pretty sure Mar became viable but golden
[02:26:52] was still better usually but Mar becomes
[02:26:54] viable so I'm not going to judge someone
[02:26:55] for like a viable build you get me you
[02:26:56] get
[02:26:59] me H plun please it's my birthday all
[02:27:02] right happy
[02:27:06] birthday I spread Al High never mind
[02:27:08] someone else I'm sorry I'm sorry someone
[02:27:11] else please someone else
[02:27:14] please
[02:27:18] um uh
[02:27:21] Linny meow okay we actually have not
[02:27:23] done a Linny so let's do a
[02:27:28] Linny
[02:27:30] glacon I don't think that's how you
[02:27:31] spell the Pokemon but sure Lenny
[02:27:35] a aamos b that's fine that's fine aamos
[02:27:37] B you get some attack you know damage uh
[02:27:41] M c0o Triple Crown we respect it let's
[02:27:45] look at your pieces flower that's good
[02:27:48] that's good feather
[02:27:51] very good uh keep in mind line sends
[02:27:53] with crit rate I'm pretty sure and he
[02:27:55] has M so you really don't want that much
[02:27:57] crit raate it's hard um you don't want
[02:28:00] to overc cap so a bit of crit rate is
[02:28:02] good but pieces without it are still
[02:28:03] fine Sans that's okay I mean it's not
[02:28:06] great but it's okay that's very good
[02:28:11] lastly
[02:28:14] okay good good lny I like it good
[02:28:19] lny Len is interesting to build because
[02:28:21] it's like you want crit damage but a lot
[02:28:23] of times you might not want more crit
[02:28:25] rate if you already have like especially
[02:28:26] with like a crit weapon or or something
[02:28:27] like if you don't have if you have a lot
[02:28:29] with Mar and then you because you send
[02:28:30] with c and you have Mari and then it's
[02:28:32] like well you want attack but you don't
[02:28:33] really need attack because you're
[02:28:34] running Bennett and P resonance and no
[02:28:36] bless oblig so it's like your sub stats
[02:28:38] are kind and you don't need that much ER
[02:28:39] so his sub stats are kind of like
[02:28:41] question mark But crit damage is really
[02:28:45] good um I mean attack's obviously good
[02:28:47] too but yeah all right
[02:28:50] let's see if EU is better yeah nice try

[02:32:17] e e what the [ __ ] you got for

[02:32:25] start with top one Shia you know what
[02:32:27] sure we'll start with the we'll start EU
[02:32:29] off strong with Shia I want to see how
[02:32:31] your Shia compares to mine okay that
[02:32:34] looks Russian exactly a th000
[02:32:35] achievements congrats you literally
[02:32:37] cannot play the game
[02:32:39] anymore let's look at this Tri black
[02:32:42] Liff pole um I hate this one actually I
[02:32:45] don't it's a free to play option
[02:32:47] sometimes you got nothing better cuz
[02:32:48] it's free to play it's all good good
[02:32:50] it's all good it's all good at least TR
[02:32:52] has a freeo play option unlike acaron uh
[02:32:54] for that's good CZ uh Crown normals I

[02:33:09] is
[02:33:18] good that's really good actually very
[02:33:21] good very good goblet um good Circle you
[02:33:24] got some attack as well what's your crit
[02:33:25] rate looking like
[02:33:27] 666 I like it very based build I like it
[02:33:31] you got some Er you have a pretty good
[02:33:32] ratio especially with Mar chose that
[02:33:34] gives you about 100 crit
[02:33:37] rate attack's a bit low sh's also not
[02:33:40] level 90 and your talents are a bit low
[02:33:42] although normal attack is the main one
[02:33:43] that matters um but good TR
[02:33:51] uh attack low doesn't matter I much
[02:33:52] you're playing shenyun but I don't know
[02:33:53] if you have shenyun um but in general
[02:33:56] Bennett would give you attack so it's
[02:34:02] fine all right what's
[02:34:04] up uh almost freeto play rder what does
[02:34:07] almost freeto play mean why would you
[02:34:08] even mention you know what I'm doing
[02:34:10] this official build I'm going to review
[02:34:12] we reviewed a Miko let's review
[02:34:16] official mmis Cala
[02:34:20] let's look at this official stringless
[02:34:23] R1 I mean it's it's still good

[02:34:57] this a good [ __ ] ficial yeah good and
[02:34:59] the crit doesn't look insane but your
[02:35:01] weapon doesn't have crit so actually
[02:35:02] good I like it uh I almost said when I
[02:35:05] saw stringless R1 C2 that you should
[02:35:08] pull for the ey but uh I see your build
[02:35:10] and you know what good fishal I respect
[02:35:12] it you have a decent amount of em a
[02:35:14] decent amount of attack good amount of
[02:35:16] crit um some teams might want a little
[02:35:20] bit of ER but for the most part it's
[02:35:22] fine I have to blow my nose again one

[02:36:58] account sure what's why do I a meta
[02:37:02] player hate you engulfing lightning four
[02:37:04] emblem I mean looks pretty meta to me
[02:37:05] you're C1 okay interesting stopping
[02:37:08] point
[02:37:11] um I mean these look like pretty
[02:37:13] standard
[02:37:14] builds um
[02:37:26] yeah best rizzly let's look at this
[02:37:29] rizzly rizzly build Garbo if I don't get
[02:37:31] C6 faru soon I will wait whoa whoa what
[02:37:34] are you going to do yo yo it's okay it's
[02:37:37] it's fine hey hey it's all good man it's
[02:37:39] all dude worst case just start swiping a
[02:37:41] little I'm not encouraging swiping but
[02:37:43] if it's that bad you know maybe just
[02:37:44] like you know like like find like some
[02:37:46] employment maybe you could like you know
[02:37:47] save up a little I don't know maybe not
[02:37:49] that's all good you don't have to don't
[02:37:50] you know don't feel forced to Shia is
[02:37:52] still good even without C6 poers on it's
[02:37:53] just a pretty big level up but that's
[02:37:55] okay withi
[02:37:57] R3 um okay for Mar say that's
[02:38:02] good c0 we're just that's fine 10 N8
[02:38:06] okay let's look at your uh pieces flower
[02:38:09] that is pretty insane I can't lie that
[02:38:13] is also pretty insane I can't lie crit
[02:38:15] damage on the set is very good s holy
[02:38:17] [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is that
[02:38:22] this is illegal it's also in this set I
[02:38:24] don't know if I've even done this domain
[02:38:26] more than like five times uh what I mean
[02:38:30] it's okay I mean it's fine if you're
[02:38:32] melting it's
[02:38:34] okay um that's a good circet it's fine
[02:38:38] if your sub stats are really [ __ ] on
[02:38:39] cryo it's fine to do em you also have a
[02:38:42] ton of crit damage um so I guess well it
[02:38:47] it depends with whith cuz if you get the
[02:38:49] em buff then you already have a [ __ ] ton
[02:38:51] of em so em goblet becomes a bit worse
[02:38:53] uh with Wiz it that's kind of random but
[02:38:55] yes either like attack and EM goblets
[02:38:57] are better if you're playing someone
[02:38:58] like finina who gives you a lot of
[02:39:00] damage bonus so I think it's fine um
[02:39:05] yeah yeah that's good
[02:39:13] good uh let me look at one of the donos
[02:39:16] what is
[02:39:17] this Emma oh yeah this a sh build
[02:39:20] what was this 2,000 attack 61 em I don't
[02:39:22] know why I mentioned the EM Jade Spear
[02:39:24] four Vermilion C6 Triple Crown you know
[02:39:27] what I respect you I respect you I
[02:39:29] respect you because you're a fellow
[02:39:31] Shain that I would kill for that I
[02:39:34] actually would kill if if if someone
[02:39:36] told me right now
[02:39:38] hey
[02:39:40] hey I'm not going to say what I'm
[02:39:42] thinking but if I could steal this piece
[02:39:44] from your account I would if I could
[02:39:46] swap take this piece and then you're
[02:39:48] left without it I would wouldn't even
[02:39:49] feel bad I'm sorry uh very good feather
[02:39:52] very very very very good offset piece as
[02:39:54] well so far three out of three is
[02:39:56] actually pretty insane uh does your
[02:39:59] goblet match
[02:40:02] up I'm almost relieved because if this
[02:40:04] was like the best goblet I've ever seen
[02:40:06] I would have been mad after spending my
[02:40:08] entire life savings in Vermillion for
[02:40:10] like two years now um but this is pretty
[02:40:13] insane like this circlet is insane this
[02:40:15] flower is insane this feather is insane
[02:40:17] This Ss is insane you're you're probably
[02:40:19] insane cuz you play Shia and no sane
[02:40:21] person Mains Shia look at you literally
[02:40:23] if you play Shia look in the mirror like
[02:40:25] me like we're probably similar and do I
[02:40:28] look sane actually yes I do so uh we're
[02:40:31] cool uh let's look good [ __ ] show now
[02:40:36] I will say something if you are playing
[02:40:37] Shia with shenyun you get some bonus
[02:40:40] crit rate so I don't like being at like
[02:40:42] 100 like I like staying a bit lower um
[02:40:44] like 92 cuz crit card gives you eight
[02:40:46] Shen Yun can give you 10 or four out to
[02:40:48] 10 so
[02:40:49] that's just me um but this is really
[02:40:52] good ER is not needed cuz your C6 and uh
[02:40:55] decent attack I like the show maybe you
[02:40:59] should take a shower that was cringe I'm
[02:41:01] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry good show
[02:41:04] though
[02:41:07] Barbara good Barbara good
[02:41:14] Barbara review Lydia's duuke she's in
[02:41:17] class dude I'm why would I review
[02:41:18] someone's Luke if they're in class you
[02:41:20] know what F they've been dude this dude
[02:41:23] they've been asking for a deluke review
[02:41:25] for like eight [ __ ] years this is the
[02:41:28] one person that actually still wants my
[02:41:29] duuke guide fine fine but you've had so
[02:41:33] long to build your duuke if he's bad The
[02:41:36] Bad Hammer will
[02:41:38] strike wolves gravestone I respect that
[02:41:41] C4 triple ground okay the last remaining
[02:41:44] duuk M before Shen Yun but now uh now
[02:41:48] deluk actually
[02:41:51] cracked okay I'm noticing
[02:41:54] look this is crazy on International
[02:41:57] women's month but I'm noticing a trend
[02:41:59] with who you're crowning and who you're
[02:42:01] abstaining from crowning vent's an
[02:42:04] exception but anyways the Luke trible
[02:42:07] Crow uh I respect it let's look at your
[02:42:09] build four Cris wit of flames with a
[02:42:10] lava walker uh goblet you know this
[02:42:12] goblet is going to go hard yeah that
[02:42:14] goes pretty hard very good crit value
[02:42:16] and some em
[02:42:17] SS wow that's [ __ ] insane I will I
[02:42:20] have to say this I'm sorry I don't want
[02:42:22] to be that guy but with a high attack
[02:42:25] weapon like Will's gravestone pyro
[02:42:26] resonance and Bennett and no bless oblig
[02:42:28] and Shen Yun who uh benefits more from
[02:42:31] damage sources than attack uh em s is
[02:42:34] usually
[02:42:35] better by an okay amount but substats
[02:42:38] matter and your substats are insane so
[02:42:40] I'm not judging you good good very good
[02:42:42] uh
[02:42:43] Sans
[02:42:47] feather and every Subs that here is good
[02:42:50] I'm going to press that again every Subs
[02:42:52] that here is good
[02:42:53] flower every Subs that here is
[02:42:56] good
[02:42:59] ciret oh that's actually
[02:43:02] good
[02:43:03] Dam dude low key you're making up for
[02:43:06] the no em Sand by having 175 on your
[02:43:09] pieces good amount of crit and an attack
[02:43:10] weapon this pretty crack this actually
[02:43:12] might
[02:43:14] be outside of my duuke of course this
[02:43:16] might be the best deloe we've seen yet
[02:43:18] this actually actually
[02:43:24] insane ah not to be that guy you
[02:43:27] probably get crit raate with shenyun so
[02:43:29] a bit of crit damage might be a bit more
[02:43:31] optimal but this is really good this
[02:43:33] really good this really cuz the crit
[02:43:35] ratio is like you would think it like
[02:43:37] you look at this you're like it's good
[02:43:38] but it's not like out of this world but
[02:43:39] you also have an attack weapon and a lot
[02:43:41] of em so I think it's better than it
[02:43:43] looks it's a good duuke this one of the
[02:43:45] better delukes we've
[02:43:47] seen dude this Sands is
[02:43:55] illegal that that's a crazy
[02:44:03] deluke all right next
[02:44:13] one nevet oh we actually have not seen a
[02:44:16] neet we'll do net dust
[02:44:20] lemon wait Chad have you seen
[02:44:29] this can I using this

[02:46:03] um what's your weapon to I already
[02:46:06] checked that you might there's actually
[02:46:07] a chance you might want an HP circlet if
[02:46:09] your HP is too low I didn't look at the
[02:46:10] total that's a good goblet very good
[02:46:12] goblet actually um s is pretty cracked

[02:47:09] what I said has the skin nice boob
[02:47:11] window let's look at the builds uh
[02:47:16] build this is a 10 out of 10 piece let
[02:47:19] me tell you why not only is it really
[02:47:21] good but also it has the mirror effect
[02:47:24] where the sub the numbers in the crit
[02:47:26] rate and crit damage are the same and
[02:47:27] all good things are symmetrical and as
[02:47:30] you can see 128
[02:47:32] 28 let's look at the feather also very
[02:47:36] good sanss don't let me

[02:47:54] [ __ ] that's actually good this is a
[02:47:56] physical main DPS Kaa 65 210 I would
[02:48:01] recommend a little bit more crit rate if
[02:48:02] I'm being honest actually Crow residence
[02:48:04] gives you some you're probably getting
[02:48:05] Crow resonance which is uh plus 15 so
[02:48:09] actually good this is a good
[02:48:11] K C1 gives crit rate oh yeah true okay
[02:48:16] never mind yeah you have a bunch of crit
[02:48:17] rate this is a good
[02:48:22] nice good

[02:56:34] Sans what the [ __ ] is this yeah that's a
[02:56:38] ban that's a ban that's a ban not from
[02:56:40] my chat but from genin as a whole I'm

[02:56:46] name is Nicholas genin impact and you
[02:56:48] just got genin
[02:56:53] impacted that's insane okay you weren't
[02:56:56] lying when you said uh clickbait where
[02:56:58] the
[02:56:59] Sands what's the crit value on this
[02:57:01] that's like 50 right wait that's
[02:57:02] actually 50 that's actually
[02:57:05] 50 3.9 * 2 7.8 Plus 43 uh uh 5 that's
[02:57:11] over 50 that's
[02:57:14] 51 wait what's my sense let me do the
[02:57:17] math real quick
[02:57:20] 51.3 chat that is the exact same crit
[02:57:23] value as my sand look 51.3 sorry same
[02:57:26] one sounds but this on a new set that's
[02:57:29] even better damn okay uh this might be
[02:57:32] the best uh I don't know best forena but
[02:57:35] so far you're looking good let's see if
[02:57:37] you have some HP on your sub stats maybe
[02:57:39] some Er I don't know what con what
[02:57:40] conation are you czo so er is nice but
[02:57:42] you have F Sil Fairman which gives a lot
[02:57:44] of ER so you might not actually need um
[02:57:46] much at all right depends on your team
[02:57:49] goblet that's really good HP double crit
[02:57:52] yeah the attack is wasted but really
[02:57:54] good last but not Le least please don't
[02:57:56] let me down uh
[02:58:00] ciret it's okay there's a lot of HP HP
[02:58:04] is good on finina now is this a Fall
[02:58:06] From Grace from this piece yes but it's
[02:58:08] still really good it's still it's 15%
[02:58:11] attack
[02:58:13] um this is a good finina I can't lie 34k
[02:58:16] HP good crit rate ratio the ER is it
[02:58:20] seems low but you get more with this
[02:58:22] weapon um oh wait you actually have too
[02:58:24] much crit
[02:58:26] rate wait you actually have like over
[02:58:29] 100 crate with
[02:58:32] this
[02:58:34] um
[02:58:40] huh that's it's okay though it's still
[02:58:44] good yeah it's still good I would um if
[02:58:47] I'm recommend something to you I would
[02:58:48] say
[02:58:50] either probably a crit damage circuit
[02:58:52] with a lot of crit rate on the subs
[02:58:53] would actually help you quite a bit but
[02:58:55] it's good well I don't know if that
[02:58:56] would be too much actually cuz you don't
[02:58:58] want to lose 30 crit rate but how much
[02:58:59] do you gain you gain 16 so you'd only be
[02:59:02] you'd have this minus effectively 16 uh
[02:59:05] so it would be 70 and then if you had
[02:59:06] like 10 on your subs it' be 80 which
[02:59:09] honestly is a no but then your CR damage
[02:59:11] would be really high it's not even a bad
[02:59:12] ratio though it just depends on your
[02:59:14] subs it's a good finina A bit high on
[02:59:16] the crit rate which you could just with
[02:59:18] your pieces but overall good Fino good
[02:59:22] Fino yeah it a good [ __ ] Fino
[02:59:25] especially Sans feather
[02:59:28] Jeepers
[02:59:33] Jeepers
[02:59:36] uh oh it's Sith first message dude
[02:59:39] imagine typing your first message in
[02:59:40] chat and you get [ __ ] build reviewed
[02:59:42] you must be like dude this streamer
[02:59:43] reads every message he loves me he loves
[02:59:46] me yeah yeah not Paras socially let's
[02:59:48] look at this big T Big T you got Hunter
[02:59:50] path okay wanders troop C2 Triple Crown
[02:59:55] damn okay you're not you're not [ __ ]
[02:59:57] around I respect
[03:00:00] that that's a good [ __ ] flower let I
[03:00:03] mean to be fair ar60 wander troop has
[03:00:07] been in the game since 1.0 you get it
[03:00:08] from bosses so I expect good wanders but
[03:00:12] this is really good that's also really
[03:00:15] good you got em as well on both of these
[03:00:16] pieces which is very good for this
[03:00:18] character
[03:00:20] Sans Dam this might be the best
[03:00:24] tyari I'm American and I endorse T
[03:00:27] tinari is endorsed by real American
[03:00:30] Patriots this tinari is endorsed by real
[03:00:33] American Patriots sorry um
[03:00:37] goblet okay that's pretty [ __ ] good
[03:00:40] you got some em as well last but not
[03:00:42] least
[03:00:43] ciret okay I like this [ __ ] big T
[03:00:48] God damn and it's symmetrical it's like
[03:00:50] it it's visually pleasing you got
[03:00:53] 20.0 a lot of em good amount of crit
[03:00:56] rate well I say good amount but you know
[03:01:01] 100 C1 doomed well I forget what his C1
[03:01:06] does it gives crit rate right uh
[03:01:11] oh constellation charge TR rate
[03:01:14] increased by 15% oh okay I will say
[03:01:17] though ass assuming you're c0 pretend I
[03:01:19] didn't see that amazing
[03:01:21] um optimal advice would be a little bit
[03:01:24] less crit rate maybe you're like your
[03:01:26] off piece or something could have more
[03:01:28] em crit damage attacks fine but crit
[03:01:31] damage would be good uh but this is
[03:01:33] insane like I'm not going to [ __ ] you
[03:01:35] have 44 crit rate on your weapon it's
[03:01:38] still really good cuz I remember um in
[03:01:40] like my AA weapon ranking even if you're
[03:01:42] like 10% overcapped on Jade cutter it's
[03:01:44] still really good so I assume even if
[03:01:46] you're a bit overcapped cuz of see one
[03:01:48] it's still a great build
[03:01:50] um I like
[03:01:55] it
[03:02:08] yeah what is this finina freeto play
[03:02:11] abiba wait actually no we've done too
[03:02:13] many Finas we've done so many I want to
[03:02:15] do a new character no oh rare colle all
[03:02:18] right let's look at your
[03:02:19] colle this better be
[03:02:22] good
[03:02:24] W all right stringless R5 C6 not Crown
[03:02:30] so I don't know if you are actually
[03:02:32] loyal to uh like if you actually do use
[03:02:34] your Cola but it it is leveled a decent
[03:02:36] amount so I will give you the benefit of
[03:02:38] the doubt deepwood memory two deepwood
[03:02:39] two wanders okay um wait why wanders
[03:02:44] what are you playing her in what like
[03:02:46] are you playing spread what's your team
[03:02:48] cuz if you're playing quick in you don't
[03:02:49] really need em
[03:02:51] um but oh I mean you're doing stringless
[03:02:55] you might actually be playing spread
[03:02:57] like you might actually be
[03:03:01] like spread all high thumb okay I'm
[03:03:03] going to assume you're proing spread on
[03:03:05] her uh okay that's good then pretty good

[03:03:19] good
[03:03:20] co it's good col usually I see col like
[03:03:23] favonius or L as a support I think
[03:03:25] you're trying to do damage with her I
[03:03:27] respect that uh not necessarily the most
[03:03:30] optimal way to play her but I respect it
[03:03:33] cuz we are for fun
[03:03:39] Gamers wait is this 100 ER you
[03:03:44] better anyways
[03:03:48] uh let me see if I miss

[03:04:43] feather that's also no wasted substats
[03:04:46] which is what we like to see see on top
[03:04:48] of just crit sand don't let me down
[03:04:50] Sands are hard to get I feel like all
[03:04:51] magy Hunter Sands I get or I see are are
[03:04:54] terrible never that's where they
[03:04:58] went to everyone watching this who has a
[03:05:01] bad magy Sands cuz I know I do and
[03:05:03] you're like dude I like where are the
[03:05:05] good ones going it's this person what's
[03:05:07] their name what's their name silus this
[03:05:09] is who you should be mad at I'm sorry no
[03:05:11] disrespect silus uh really good
[03:05:14] sounds that's actually very good as well
[03:05:16] attack crit rate damage and more crit
[03:05:19] damage which is good on a crit rate
[03:05:21] set 24 ER this might be the first Ula I
[03:05:24] see that has enough ER although you have
[03:05:26] C6 um I forget Chad dud any your
[03:05:30] conations give energy I
[03:05:32] forget but these are good subsid
[03:05:36] attacker no I see then this is really
[03:05:40] good so BR R5 C6 Ula the reveal are you
[03:05:44] crit fishing or do you have a good ratio
[03:05:48] it's good this is good
[03:05:52] this it's good uh you have Mar you have
[03:05:56] marish you have Mar that's 36 + 43 which
[03:06:00] is 79 so basically
[03:06:04] 80 that's good I forgot you had Mar for
[03:06:07] dude Mar
[03:06:09] or
[03:06:11] yeah M always messes with me cuz like oh
[03:06:14] and Crow residence well it depends what
[03:06:16] you're playing but yes I assume the the
[03:06:18] the new like the new the new hotness for
[03:06:21] YULA teams is YULA Ryden finina and then
[03:06:23] a cryo healer for energy and you get
[03:06:25] crowd residents and a lot of crow Heroes
[03:06:28] just have Synergy in that team like MAA
[03:06:30] um but you can do shot and diona as well
[03:06:32] although I don't really like daa there I
[03:06:33] feel like cuz she gives a lot of energy
[03:06:35] but kind of bad healing for finina so I
[03:06:38] like
[03:06:38] MAA um shot's pretty good
[03:06:44] too but yeah this is a good you uh YULA
[03:06:46] my reaction was skewed cuz I forgot you
[03:06:48] have Mari but very good 150 ER is this
[03:06:52] is the first time I see a Ula that might
[03:06:54] actually have too much ER but it depends
[03:06:56] on your team good good
[03:06:58] YULA very good YULA very good
[03:07:09] YULA ayato I need advice okay we give
[03:07:11] you advice what do you need buddy e okay

[03:07:58] don't really need advice this is a
[03:07:59] pretty good IO um your your goblet and
[03:08:02] Sans could be better but it is what it
[03:08:03] is like your sand is especially bad
[03:08:06] that's the only piece I would
[03:08:08] change but um it's pretty decent like
[03:08:11] it'll do its job like io's pretty good
[03:08:14] even without the most investment you
[03:08:15] play them on field in like taser Bloom

[03:08:20] not bad or soup or

[03:17:02] good Sans em with some HP and double
[03:17:05] crit very good very good feather because
[03:17:07] yeah the crit isn't that impressive but
[03:17:08] you have a lot of HP and defense so that
[03:17:10] you don't die that's a joke defense
[03:17:11] sucks but the rest is good flower that
[03:17:13] is uh pretty yeah very good very good
[03:17:15] flower ciret
[03:17:21] okay now my mental math might not be the
[03:17:22] best but you want on a crit rate circl

[03:17:27] match actually good wait that's good
[03:17:30] that's actually good this is a good this
[03:17:32] is like the first to with enough CR rate
[03:17:34] in the world by the way in the world by
[03:17:35] the way I mean it's kind of because of
[03:17:37] Deathmatch but yeah good to you got some
[03:17:39] em you got some HP good crit ratio uh
[03:17:42] not many wasted subsat right like the
[03:17:44] defense One Flat defense
[03:17:47] One Flat HP attack's fine flat I mean
[03:17:50] okay there's some Wast Subs but overall
[03:17:52] really good good all right we can end on

[03:27:29] job drink
[03:27:40] cheers mistyped dude you failed the IQ
[03:27:44] check I'm sorry but life has an IQ check
[03:27:48] and you should not be rewarded for
[03:27:49] failing it however let's see if you're
[03:27:52] never let is
[03:27:53] better this is level 80 are you AR
[03:27:56] you're AR 60 this is level 80 R1 your
[03:28:07] ar60 okay I'm just going to look at your
[03:28:09] Soo before
[03:28:14] I this is not bad it's it's actually
[03:28:18] fine this is fine this is net though
[03:28:23] um I don't know what
[03:28:44] happened wait Chad I have a
[03:28:49] question but this isn't a question a
[03:28:51] guide maker should be asking chat it's a
[03:28:53] question you should be asking me but I
[03:28:54] have a quo I have
[03:29:00] aaso um okay you know how a lot of
[03:29:07] characters you know a lot of characters
[03:29:09] can like bench their goblets or circlets
[03:29:11] right you can go like HP ciret HP goblet
[03:29:14] uh it's like that on a lot of characters
[03:29:15] right
[03:29:19] where's chori CH is a good
[03:29:21] example right CH has like split
[03:29:24] scaling well dual scaling right and it's
[03:29:26] like okay A lot of times you could do
[03:29:28] like like defense goblet is pretty
[03:29:29] similar or uh defense ciret
[03:29:33] right but hear me out okay if you're
[03:29:35] building properly okay and you have high
[03:29:36] crit rate like to a consistent degree
[03:29:39] then crit damage on your circit is
[03:29:44] essentially 62%
[03:29:46] and geam goet is 46% so don't you just
[03:29:50] [ __ ] bench your ciret I mean bench
[03:29:52] your goblet before benching your ciret I
[03:29:54] know it's different I know it's not the
[03:29:55] same crit damage and Geo damage but like
[03:29:57] feel like you just bench your um your
[03:30:00] goblet before you're benching your circl
[03:30:03] right no okay well I'm pretty sure for
[03:30:05] chori gobl let's better I mean um
[03:30:08] defense goblet is
[03:30:09] better I'm pretty
[03:30:13] sure like I'm like 99.98%
[03:30:16] but I can
[03:30:17] check I think it's somewhere in my
[03:30:20] resource
[03:30:24] Library depends on the character yeah
[03:30:26] yeah some characters get a [ __ ] ton of
[03:30:28] like damage
[03:30:43] percent H yeah
[03:30:47] they more crit damage usually yeah but
[03:30:49] Chi gets like I mean
[03:30:54] not I guess it depends on your
[03:30:57] weapon yeah I guess it depends but also
[03:31:00] here you got a [ __ ] down of dam like
[03:31:02] this isn't crit damage it's skill damage
[03:31:05] percent um from your
[03:31:11] set but yeah which is why people do
[03:31:14] defense goblet a lot
[03:31:17] or ciret yeah also I think uh yeah
[03:31:20] goblets are hard to get which I think is
[03:31:21] the main thing actually I think that's
[03:31:23] actually the main thing is that goblets
[03:31:25] are kind of hard to
[03:31:27] get um well very hard to get and
[03:31:30] circlets are hard but not as hard not
[03:31:32] nearly as
[03:31:34] hard do acon video Duality probably I
[03:31:38] don't know probably
[03:31:40] tomorrow it's not going to be a full
[03:31:41] guide though just like a review
[03:31:48] have more damage or crit damage yeah
[03:31:49] yeah like for sure but I just feel like
[03:31:52] if all things are similar it's like
[03:31:54] you're losing 46
[03:31:56] versus like what's even more important
[03:31:58] than damage percent sometimes is just
[03:31:59] the crit rate circlet giving you
[03:32:01] consistency but um I know it depends
[03:32:05] like I'm sure there's yeah like it
[03:32:09] depends W anyways equin donated
[03:32:14] $20 yo it's it's stop it we are not
[03:32:18] doing reviews
[03:32:20] anymore stop it okay I'll change my
[03:32:23] [ __ ] title I'll change my [ __ ]
[03:32:25] title last
[03:32:30] one I'm trying to recruit a new recruit
[03:32:33] Army I don't know what that means rizzly
[03:32:36] all right cash flow what the [ __ ]
[03:32:47] this is C6 R5 Triple Crown
[03:32:52] Grizzly okay let's look at your build
[03:32:54] please don't let me down you are not
[03:32:56] letting me down these are perfect sub
[03:33:00] stats okay well this guy might be rizzly

[03:33:25] goblet nice attack crit damage er uh I
[03:33:29] don't you might not need that much crit
[03:33:30] raate because Mar casual I don't know
[03:33:32] we'll see uh when I look at your thing
[03:33:35] Circ that's a lot of attack it's not
[03:33:40] bad it's actually good you actually
[03:33:41] don't need more crit rate so the ciret
[03:33:43] that doesn't have that much crit rate
[03:33:44] and the go it actually are good here
[03:33:47] because you have like 90 something crit
[03:33:48] rate actually more you have basically
[03:33:50] 100 you actually basically have 100 crit
[03:33:52] rate and crit D you actually have you
[03:33:54] have more if you're running um well I
[03:33:56] don't know what team you're running if
[03:33:56] you're running melt you don't really get
[03:33:57] crowd resonance if you're not you might

[03:34:59] be that guy so I'm gonna say
[03:35:08] something uh first of all if you don't
[03:35:10] know you're not entitled to anything

[03:38:51] guess your weapon gives um some
[03:38:57] HP no HP perc no HP perc no HP well okay
[03:39:02] I guess it's cuz you're on a hydro
[03:39:03] goblet that's actually fine ah is
[03:39:06] it damage damage
[03:39:09] damage alt
[03:39:13] damage it's still good though

[03:39:22] insane that's insane this is insane yeah
[03:39:25] it's good low HP but
[03:39:28] um C1 neutral face yeah there's no C2
[03:39:33] which is uh a tragedy C1 doesn't even
[03:39:35] exist for the record I mean okay C1 is
[03:39:37] good but it's mostly a stepping like C
[03:39:40] her C1 is good but it's mostly a
[03:39:41] stepping stone for C2
[03:39:47] that's good good for you
[03:39:49] now low HP though but um it's all good
[03:39:55] aelius no we're
[03:39:59] done a question for Star rail okay I
[03:40:03] can't tell you if you should wait for
[03:40:04] adventurine or not cuz we don't know
[03:40:05] what he
[03:40:07] does but if you have jard or like lyns
[03:40:10] it could be your second sustain for now
[03:40:12] uh if you're asking Lua versus fushen
[03:40:14] usually Fen
[03:40:16] I personally just like lra for blade but
[03:40:18] outside of that Fan's pretty
[03:40:28] broken
[03:40:31] W then they show in the live stream yeah
[03:40:34] but like not really like we know kind of
[03:40:35] what he does but we don't really know if
[03:40:37] he's good or
[03:40:39] not at least I don't like I didn't like
[03:40:41] actively
[03:40:43] like yeah I know if Aron's good
[03:40:46] but um
[03:40:48] yeah
[03:40:53] mons can you say good night to me
[03:40:56] paraso no good night but not parasocial
[03:41:01] all right let me uh uncount my resin
[03:41:08] PW why you say sparkle over Acron last
[03:41:11] stream wait are you
[03:41:13] trolling is this a joke are you a
[03:41:15] sparkle
[03:41:18] [Music]
[03:41:20] hater you did LOL W yeah think I lied I
[03:41:24] don't care I [ __ ] love Sparkle you
[03:41:26] think I give a [ __ ] actually I didn't
[03:41:28] say that I said at the end of the stream
[03:41:29] when everyone left I said at the end of
[03:41:31] the stream when everyone left so it
[03:41:32] wasn't like I said don't quote me on it
[03:41:33] cuz I don't want to have to defend that
[03:41:34] opinion however yeah [ __ ] you I like
[03:41:37] sparkle she's great
[03:41:51] Harmony ORS are boring ad Zio I agree
[03:41:55] doesn't change the fact that she's
[03:41:57] great
[03:42:04] sh uh uh Sparkle at least lets you like
[03:42:09] do interesting teams and like like I
[03:42:12] enjoy doing [ __ ] Sparkle BR blade and
[03:42:15] just like spamming his turns
[03:42:20] um some Harmony kind of just like press
[03:42:23] a button I mean I guess she also presses
[03:42:25] a button but you
[03:42:28] know
[03:42:30] coold acon though like genuinely I wish
[03:42:33] I recorded when uh this happened but
[03:42:35] like the first time I alted on acon I
[03:42:38] was like holy [ __ ] this is stupid like
[03:42:41] but it's kind of a Ula Factor where it's
[03:42:43] damage per screenshot and I have had her
[03:42:45] signature you'll see when the video's
[03:42:47] out um it is very much like I was like
[03:42:50] dude how is this fair but you know it it
[03:42:53] it's not like gamebreaking it's
[03:42:57] just yeah the
[03:43:00] world
[03:43:05] everybody I saw playing starl cuz
[03:43:07] building characters scared me it doesn't
[03:43:09] dude 99% of star Rail and genin players
[03:43:12] don't know how to properly build
[03:43:13] characters and that's fine play casually
[03:43:15] play all you want to play it doesn't
[03:43:15] really matter like it matters to clear
[03:43:17] content but you're like all you need to
[03:43:19] do is like look up one guide or actually
[03:43:22] [ __ ] guides just or if you want I have
[03:43:24] some but like for the most part
[03:43:27] like there's a how do I say this a lot
[03:43:31] of the times you can just deduce what's
[03:43:34] good on a character with a bit of basic
[03:43:35] knowledge and then you might not be
[03:43:37] optimal but you should be able to clear
[03:43:39] for example like a lot of the times you
[03:43:42] just do either whatever stat you're
[03:43:44] scaling on or speed for your boots and
[03:43:47] then you go like damage orb attack or ER
[03:43:49] rope and then crit on your sub stats and
[03:43:53] like that's usually fine like some
[03:43:54] characters are different like you know
[03:43:55] damage over time wants like attack and
[03:43:57] like supports want other stats and some
[03:44:00] characters want you know EHR but
[03:44:06] yeah
[03:44:11] balls also I have a question
[03:44:16] where did
[03:44:18] the is this like a TC or something like
[03:44:21] where did all the speed boot acaron Doom
[03:44:23] post thing come from cuz I've seen a lot
[03:44:25] of
[03:44:25] it where did this come from cuz like I
[03:44:28] get attack like I when I was alone in my
[03:44:32] room I was like I kind of want to go
[03:44:33] attack boots so that or not necessarily
[03:44:35] attack boot I kind like I want to make
[03:44:37] my supports super fast so that she can
[03:44:39] ult without even needing to have a turn
[03:44:42] but I don't think um speed is
[03:44:46] bad like I get you want to hypers speed
[03:44:48] your
[03:44:51] supports but I don't think I like I
[03:44:53] think attack might be slightly better
[03:44:55] but I don't think it's
[03:44:57] like I don't think it's enough to where
[03:45:00] people saying speed boots are bad is
[03:45:01] true it could be like maybe I'm wrong
[03:45:03] but I think both are fine I don't know
[03:45:07] I'll look into it more before I
[03:45:10] guide speed is easier to break yeah dude
[03:45:13] speed dude let being able to go more
[03:45:15] often to break more often in my opinion
[03:45:18] is almost more important than
[03:45:20] like a lot of
[03:45:22] things Aura wants a lot of attack yeah
[03:45:25] that's why you go and attack orb
[03:45:28] PG and rope cuz you don't need ER at
[03:45:33] all but um I mean I still use the attack
[03:45:36] boots actually uh no cuz they zero
[03:45:38] cycled but
[03:45:43] yeah anyways back to back to
[03:45:49] G feels the same as in b Lune
[03:45:59] May if no signature lyone yeah lyone
[03:46:02] changes it also if you play Sparkle that
[03:46:04] changes it also if you
[03:46:07] um yeah it depends on your orb and on
[03:46:09] your sub stats and also if you ever want
[03:46:12] speed like if you're trying to zero
[03:46:13] cycle
[03:46:15] um
[03:46:16] then you're the the the thing with if
[03:46:19] you ever need speed like let's say you
[03:46:21] need 134 I mean you might not but if you
[03:46:24] do since you can't get crit as a main
[03:46:26] stat it's kind of like in genin with ER
[03:46:28] main stats uh with Sans I mean sorry
[03:46:31] it's like let's say your
[03:46:36] character um yeah like er can't how do I
[03:46:41] say this actually crit can't be a main
[03:46:44] stat on your sand or on your like boots
[03:46:46] so if you need a piece like let's say
[03:46:48] you want some speed you'd rather have
[03:46:50] speed on your boots and crit substats
[03:46:52] than attack on your boots and then speed
[03:46:54] sub stats because usually crit is better
[03:46:56] than attack not always not always but a
[03:46:59] lot of times it's like that for like
[03:47:00] Sands or like boots or like [ __ ] like
[03:47:02] that um but that's not to say speed is
[03:47:07] like better than attack always cuz
[03:47:09] sometimes it's not where you get your
[03:47:11] rings I don't [ __ ] know the mole I
[03:47:13] didn't like order those
[03:47:16] let the
[03:47:18] world except the showering I have that's
[03:47:20] from like be lovely they have like a
[03:47:22] showering Prett cool everybody stand to
[03:47:25] the wicked z i stall I don't
[03:47:39] stall I don't stall that's not true I
[03:47:43] matter of fact I've almost never stalled
[03:47:49] it's going to be good crit damage attack
[03:47:50] HP I like
[03:48:05] it jingl better too early to tell but I
[03:48:08] think they're similar and I think I
[03:48:11] think with her L cone Arron's better but
[03:48:13] also it depends on your team because
[03:48:15] uh jinglu can use some like you're
[03:48:18] running double nil usually with um acon
[03:48:22] and jinglu is a bit more like friendly
[03:48:25] options with like lyones and
[03:48:27] [Applause]
[03:48:29] stuff but I think they're both
[03:48:31] good like I think they're both very good
[03:48:47] is Ting Yun good um no unless you have
[03:48:50] E2 then you can kind of flex a Harmony
[03:48:53] but for the most part I I wouldn't
[03:48:54] actually no she she gives energy Aron
[03:48:56] doesn't use energy no no no no never
[03:48:57] mind I lied I said maybe I meant to say
[03:49:00] no you don't want
[03:49:10] energy balls
[03:49:17] she gives attack cool so does like every
[03:49:19] other
[03:49:21] nihility or damage or a instant action
[03:49:38] advance I said nil I meant to say
[03:49:40] Harmony but usually you're going nil
[03:49:41] with that character anyways unless
[03:49:42] you're E2 but I meant to say Harmony
[03:49:45] if I said
[03:49:49] nil is Robin good feels crafting bro she
[03:49:52] is not
[03:49:55] out uh kind of persona it's around a 15%
[03:49:59] damage increase from her best her
[03:50:02] signature to her second best light cone
[03:50:04] it varies based on like everything but
[03:50:06] you also get your alt back more often
[03:50:08] with her ly cone which is [ __ ] stupid
[03:50:11] like you apply a debuff on her which
[03:50:12] gives her better up time on her set and
[03:50:14] more alt and it's a pretty significant
[03:50:16] damage increase and if God forbid you
[03:50:19] don't have S5 uh good night sleep well
[03:50:21] it could be like a 30% damage increase
[03:50:23] or I I'm pretty sure to formada it was a
[03:50:25] lot more but I don't know if I don't
[03:50:28] know I don't want to I don't want to
[03:50:29] yeah there'll be a like on ranking for
[03:50:31] my gun but
[03:50:39] yeah oh is that what was confusing me
[03:50:42] Triple is speed the speed boots is is
[03:50:45] was the attack boot thing for non like
[03:50:47] cone I mean I know she wants attack in
[03:50:49] general and attack versus lightning orb
[03:50:52] is pretty
[03:50:54] comparable but um I guess speed helps
[03:50:57] when you can apply what the [ __ ] why am
[03:50:58] I
[03:51:08] dead use cfas likeon yes you use cfas or
[03:51:11] um silver wolfes
[03:51:16] memory
[03:51:21] High Why didn't even my cookies were off
[03:51:26] my get they are on this team's good well
[03:51:29] not now it's going to look terrible but
[03:51:31] usually this team's
[03:51:36] good [ __ ] it
[03:51:49] for acon is a myth yeah I lowkey have to
[03:51:51] pull for her Lyon like I kind the the
[03:51:53] only thing my account could do is give
[03:51:55] her my S4 good night and sleep well and
[03:51:57] then give my Kafka another Lyon like get
[03:52:01] her a freeo play one exp the
[03:52:03] planet exp I I like if I like if I want
[03:52:07] to keep my calone going night sleep I
[03:52:08] have to pull for a Lon but I could I
[03:52:11] like realistically I could give my calf
[03:52:12] another Lon if I want like one of the
[03:52:15] freeto play
[03:52:17] ones or yeah or could buy the wel one
[03:52:19] from the shop that's true but I don't
[03:52:21] really I don't think I'm going to level
[03:52:33] that
[03:52:40] W is wild Lon even remotely decent on
[03:52:43] acon yes yeah I mean it's it's like the
[03:52:46] effect is like 24 or something damage
[03:52:48] and then you get like attack or whatever
[03:52:50] like and bust your skill it's okay like
[03:52:53] it's some stats it's literally like
[03:52:55] sometimes okay I'm not joking if you
[03:52:57] look at our free to play lones and you
[03:52:58] read it it gives
[03:53:00] nothing only on skill yeah but the the
[03:53:03] the second part is only on skill not the
[03:53:04] first part
[03:53:09] right like what other option do you
[03:53:13] have wait what are you yapping about
[03:53:15] you're literally a chief yapper am I am
[03:53:17] I
[03:53:17] joking increases damage to debuffed
[03:53:20] enemies by 24% period it ends there
[03:53:22] that's entire kit unless they don't know
[03:53:24] how to word a lone that should be entire
[03:53:29] kit and it's like is 24% that good
[03:53:34] no but um if you don't have good night
[03:53:38] and sleep well and you don't have some
[03:53:39] signature lyones you are
[03:53:42] [ __ ] it's it's well like going at that
[03:53:45] point or it's fada in a either
[03:53:48] suboptimal team or you're playing Black
[03:53:49] Swan and
[03:53:51] Kafka and then that's one or two you're
[03:53:53] going like loop with welt or three
[03:53:55] you're going a a a five star high base
[03:53:58] attack light cone from another path with
[03:54:00] no effect and like at that point like
[03:54:02] what are you doing like play [ __ ]
[03:54:04] [ __ ] QQ
[03:54:20] yeah why is someone copy pasting uh good
[03:54:21] night and sleep well good night well is
[03:54:23] broken good night is really good that's
[03:54:25] her that's her option that's her fourth
[03:54:27] option it's just if you don't have that
[03:54:29] especially like it gets a lot better
[03:54:31] with super positions but like even
[03:54:33] without like like S5 it's
[03:54:38] fine no Q sler allowed here
[03:54:42] no's really really good we like Q in
[03:54:45] this chat
[03:54:53] room was better than while
[03:55:05] likeon yeah
[03:55:15] I think the only Lyons that can be
[03:55:17] better again the the [ __ ] like
[03:55:19] ranking will be done for the actual
[03:55:21] guide not pre-release but um I'm pretty
[03:55:23] sure the only lyone that can be better
[03:55:25] than good night sleep and even then it's
[03:55:26] less raw damage but more alt is the
[03:55:28] signature lyone uh of either Kafka or um
[03:55:33] what's her name silverwolf because they
[03:55:34] give you a debuff you can apply which
[03:55:36] gives you your alt more often so it's
[03:55:38] like less raw damage because good night
[03:55:40] does a lot of damage but you get your
[03:55:41] alt more often which is good
[03:55:50] I have a question how does eon Al
[03:55:53] stack how does e
[03:55:57] what oh alt I'll explain this my video
[03:56:00] it's just off debuffs that's all it's
[03:56:02] off
[03:56:09] debuffs but you need EHR you want to
[03:56:12] know something cool if anything resists
[03:56:15] anything reset sorry that was
[03:56:18] [ __ ] the Temple of
[03:56:21] wi de with
[03:56:31] me but yeah there's a lot of ways to
[03:56:33] optimize like I really like acon I just
[03:56:35] okay the video will be out soon but like
[03:56:37] I try in it not to overhype the
[03:56:41] character um because a lot of there's a
[03:56:43] lot of like
[03:56:44] I don't really recommend them over like
[03:56:46] a jing for freeo play right like that's
[03:56:48] fair but um I get a lot of enjoyment
[03:56:51] from them and Min maxing their teams
[03:56:53] because there's a lot of cool things you
[03:56:54] can do
[03:56:56] um such as giving your supports L cones
[03:56:59] that apply debuffs like resolution like
[03:57:01] trend of the market [ __ ] like that or
[03:57:04] like like you you could put that on like
[03:57:05] japar and then he gets like he has like
[03:57:07] innate taunt not taunt but like higher
[03:57:09] aggro so stuff like that anyways
[03:57:17] all right traveler okay look you're
[03:57:20] asking jingly or Arron you have both and
[03:57:22] you have likees for both now in my
[03:57:25] opinion there's I can I can give you a
[03:57:28] definitive answer if you want when she's
[03:57:29] out but genuinely they're both very
[03:57:32] strong look at them both tell me which
[03:57:34] one you like more and then get that one
[03:57:36] cuz they're both good real like the real
[03:57:38] answer is it probably depends on your
[03:57:40] account and like what supports you have
[03:57:41] and like what you're like you have a DPS
[03:57:43] for like this [ __ ] path or not path
[03:57:46] uh type
[03:57:47] but I think both are very
[03:57:51] good your a bond is strong let's get it
[03:57:56] off
[03:58:00] looking who would you
[03:58:03] choose I personal enjoyment
[03:58:07] wise I think Aron is like a YULA that
[03:58:10] doesn't make me want to jump off a cliff
[03:58:12] so I like her because I like that YULA
[03:58:14] those burst is sick but in in Star rail
[03:58:15] you can't [ __ ] miss and enemies can't
[03:58:17] Dodge you and and and like yeah you can
[03:58:20] miss your crit but you're building crit
[03:58:22] on that character and like
[03:58:26] yeah so I do like her
[03:58:30] um I wouldn't like yeah I like
[03:58:42] her uh Terra that the
[03:58:44] the sparkle versus nil thing is a rabbit
[03:58:47] hole that I will go down for the
[03:58:56] guide I think unless you're like a
[03:59:01] okay okay this might be a bad take but a
[03:59:04] lot of the times it's you can use
[03:59:06] Sparkle if you don't have more Al yeah
[03:59:09] you can use Sparkle if you don't
[03:59:11] have um
[03:59:15] like silver wolf and you don't want to
[03:59:16] like green a Fen and stuff like that and
[03:59:18] I'm sure there situation where it is
[03:59:20] better and for now I'm just going to say
[03:59:22] it's viable but in my personal opinion
[03:59:24] opinion let's say you're doing that
[03:59:25] because you don't have silver wolf well
[03:59:27] then you probably don't have that many
[03:59:28] good harmonies on your account for your
[03:59:29] other team right like what are the odds
[03:59:31] you have Sparkle and Ron May and BR but
[03:59:33] you don't have silver wolf maybe but if
[03:59:35] that's the ca like a lot of times I
[03:59:37] think if you have sparkle you probably
[03:59:38] wanted a good nil and then you would use
[03:59:40] that on your other team and then for the
[03:59:42] character that doesn't really need
[03:59:43] Sparkle you would use your character is
[03:59:44] that she needs
[03:59:46] but I could be wrong this is a little
[03:59:49] felds crafting
[03:59:57] [Music]
[03:59:58] here fire TB fire TB gives a lot of
[04:00:01] debuffs but I don't like solo sustained
[04:00:04] fire Trailblazer but maybe that's cuz I
[04:00:06] suck at the game I actually like solo
[04:00:07] sustain wealth though which is arguably
[04:00:09] worse but I [ __ ] love it cuz it lets
[04:00:11] me just kill everything I [ __ ] love
[04:00:14] welth I'm sorry I actually really like
[04:00:21] welth with E2 can we run at boot with
[04:00:25] 160 speed Sparkle yes that's probably
[04:00:27] optimal actually
[04:00:29] yes
[04:00:41] yes sustain wealth is so cracked when
[04:00:43] you you know how to play it dude okay no
[04:00:46] cap no
[04:00:47] cope so there's a lot of wealth like die
[04:00:51] hards that want to
[04:00:54] like my my friend who's like uh part of
[04:00:58] like kaching man stuff he always tries
[04:01:01] to tell me yo make sure you talk about
[04:01:03] like how good weld's damage is people
[04:01:04] sleep on it like build damage on weld
[04:01:06] don't just you know I literally just I
[04:01:09] put a random ass garbage set random ass
[04:01:12] planner two-piece only speed and I just
[04:01:15] did no damage but I was spam slowing and
[04:01:17] spam [ __ ] uh debuffing and spam uh
[04:01:20] what is it called imprisoning and I just
[04:01:21] took no damage and I killed everything
[04:01:23] so it was fun but um I know you can
[04:01:25] optimize them more than that but my
[04:01:27] point is just even like almost no
[04:01:29] optimization he was doing good but he
[04:01:32] had speed like he was going pretty fast
[04:01:33] which matters but um
[04:01:38] yeah yeah
[04:01:44] Blade with wealth sustain okay you're a
[04:01:47] masochist I'm not saying play healer
[04:01:49] wealth like he's not a that you're not
[04:01:51] playing healer welth I I
[04:02:09] say does a blade want to get hit yeah
[04:02:13] you could say that
[04:02:17] I loved you in Dune to okay we're not
[04:02:19] going to entertain that
[04:02:24] anymore ho ho fan for Sim universe
[04:02:27] fwan
[04:02:30] or the alternative is you play fuan
[04:02:33] until you get the uh damages split
[04:02:35] across your team you take it you upgrade
[04:02:36] it so you take less damage and then you
[04:02:37] Ben for hu ho but when I did that I
[04:02:39] [ __ ] died and then everyone laughed
[04:02:41] at me
[04:02:47] okay anyways no more
[04:02:50] yapping wait let me tweet
[04:03:00] this
