[00:22:21] rail surely we'll get a free Five Star
[00:22:24] for reaching the max
[00:22:26] level
[00:22:31] we got we got one standard pass it's
[00:22:33] fine maybe it's a five star maybe once
[00:22:35] you hit r70 and you claim the pull it's
[00:22:37] a guaranteed five star when you pull it
[00:22:39] so maybe your next single pull is
[00:22:41] guaranteed a five
[00:22:47] star
[00:22:51] Amber anyways before we pull let me
[00:22:53] update you guys on what I did off stream
[00:22:55] uh I was leveling my ASA I I ascended
[00:22:57] her to 70 and then I pre- farmed so I
[00:22:58] can Ascend her to 80 right I farmed um
[00:23:02] and I leveled some of her traces not all
[00:23:05] of them but I leveled some of them uh
[00:23:07] but then I was like I'm probably just
[00:23:08] going to play tingyun anyways so I
[00:23:09] didn't finish uh but I did prearm then
[00:23:12] we also um I I auto batted a lot of
[00:23:16] Relic places I to get some uh pieces for
[00:23:20] [ __ ] topaz my ball still sucks but
[00:23:23] it's fine so we we like kind of pre-
[00:23:25] farmed I also okay listen we might bench
[00:23:28] jinguan now I rolled this piece off
[00:23:32] stream nine crit rate 16 crit damage we
[00:23:36] didn't even miss a single roll I roll
[00:23:38] that off stream cuz when I roll on
[00:23:41] stream you guys curse me then we have
[00:23:43] this ring also rolled crit it rolled uh
[00:23:45] I mean it rolled flat HP and break
[00:23:46] effect but it has two rolls in crit so
[00:23:48] if the last roll is crit I'm going to
[00:23:49] roll this right now if it misses it's
[00:23:51] cuz you guys are bad luck it's not my
[00:23:53] fault so I actually hope it misses so it
[00:23:55] confirms okay never mind that's pretty
[00:23:56] good so we have two two good pieces uh
[00:23:58] our jinguan is actually going to get un
[00:24:00] benched now the only downside of our
[00:24:01] jinguan is that he is using heo but it's
[00:24:04] fine it is what it is okay it is what it
[00:24:06] is um it is what it is don't talk about
[00:24:09] it but it's fine um it's cool it's okay
[00:24:13] um I just need to level These Boots we
[00:24:15] don't really have good boots for them
[00:24:16] but um or a good Ball but our rope is
[00:24:19] good our body is pretty good if I 15 it
[00:24:21] and our glove our hands and head are
[00:24:23] good so it's
[00:24:26] fine
[00:24:32] you have like zero crit damage dude our
[00:24:34] weapon gives us attack and our [ __ ]

[00:28:25] sense okay
[00:28:28] dude dudee dude I just need listen
[00:28:30] listen listen listen listen listen
[00:28:32] listen listen listen listen listen
[00:28:35] listen listen okay I just need a good
[00:28:38] speed
[00:28:44] boot now you might be like oh zo use the
[00:28:47] [ __ ] lightning set
[00:28:54] dude it's fine this is good enough
[00:28:58] at least our rope dude dude this
[00:28:59] actually look at our dude look it's
[00:29:01] actually 1 to2 ratio with Su leveled
[00:29:04] artifacts imagine this is 15 right
[00:29:06] imagine look I'll literally show you
[00:29:07] imagine well I can't
[00:29:15] even dude it's actually not bad though
[00:29:17] it's actually not bad yeah we don't have
[00:29:19] inert SoDo but you can inert s go [ __ ]
[00:29:22] yourself okay listen listen listen
[00:29:26] listen
[00:29:31] complain one more time I'm going to
[00:29:33] enter the [ __ ] Stardust shop and and
[00:29:35] claim oh yeah we have to claim these too
[00:29:37] I'm going to enter the [ __ ] Stardust
[00:29:38] shop you know what I'm actually going to
[00:29:40] do it before you even have a chance to
[00:29:41] complain where is it
[00:29:44] yep yeah now what yeah now
[00:29:47] what now what I have 50 fuel by the way
[00:29:51] I have 50 fuel so if we need to farm we
[00:29:54] basically can unlimited Farm let me get
[00:29:56] this to Plus 12 to show you guys no dude
[00:29:58] this is disgusting these These Boots are
[00:30:01] [ __ ] ugly and stupid and and you
[00:30:04] should feel bad for using them now I
[00:30:06] could level attack boots but I'm a big
[00:30:08] speed boot enjoyer I'm a big speed boot
[00:30:10] enjoyer I'm going to get this to plus
[00:30:11] three just to prove that it's not going
[00:30:13] to get crit damage because if it does
[00:30:15] then I'm going to look stupid and I'm
[00:30:16] going to have to use them okay no it
[00:30:17] didn't but I am a speed boot
[00:30:20] enjoyer um and it would it would make my
[00:30:23] day okay it would make my day if I had
[00:30:26] good speed boosts now an alternative
[00:30:28] solution here is to go two-piece uh ice
[00:30:31] now you might be like dude Z why the
[00:30:33] [ __ ] would you go two-piece ice it does
[00:30:34] nothing listen one it's funny okay I
[00:30:37] think it looks funny two look at these
[00:30:39] sub stats these substats are
[00:30:40] unironically better than if we went for
[00:30:43] like twopiece something else with bad
[00:30:45] Subs I actually think this is our
[00:30:46] optimal build I am not joking we have
[00:30:48] 7040 without crit on our weapon this is
[00:30:51] unironically not even bad dude listen
[00:30:54] it's not even bad and it looks funny
[00:30:57] okay there you go he's built un benched
[00:30:59] we literally un benched him it's just
[00:31:01] this thing is plus 12 only but actually
[00:31:03] not bad actually not bad we need more
[00:31:05] speed though we want 1 three uh four but
[00:31:08] hey not bad not bad not bad press one if
[00:31:11] not bad two if not
[00:31:15] bad okay I think I think our our build's
[00:31:17] actually fine uh ideally we have some
[00:31:18] speed but I don't see a way we could get
[00:31:20] more
[00:31:21] speed
[00:31:23] um unless I have like a offset crit rate
[00:31:27] thing well I mean this crit damage one's
[00:31:28] really good but we want crit rate not
[00:31:29] crit damage so is what it
[00:31:35] is yeah is what it
[00:31:39] is hey Mr socks
[00:31:42] andx flower how twitchcon did you get

[00:43:12] believer hi toas hi
[00:43:17] numi dude he's flipping a coin I'm
[00:43:21] numy tag yourself I'm the
[00:43:25] coin
[00:43:28] hey we got
[00:43:32] her now get the L cone no also the ion's
[00:43:35] not even that big of a DPS upgrade it's
[00:43:36] not that it's not like it's not it's not
[00:43:38] that good it's kind of whatever it's not
[00:43:41] bad but like why would I pull for
[00:43:47] it I don't want to listen to this right
[00:43:49] now what do I want to listen to I don't
[00:43:50] know okay anyways we got toaz pogers uh
[00:43:54] we're going to play her and uh she will
[00:43:56] carry us now listen with topaz typically
[00:44:00] unless you're playing hyper carry with
[00:44:01] her typically typically right typically
[00:44:05] you want to run her with another
[00:44:06] followup attacker you might be like oh Z
[00:44:09] does that mean I can play with claraa
[00:44:10] yes yeah you can play with claraa oh Z
[00:44:12] does that mean I can play her with um
[00:44:14] with with Koko if I want
[00:44:16] sure now we don't have either of those
[00:44:19] characters and obviously Kimo is not
[00:44:20] like that good but CLA would be the best
[00:44:23] now someone we do have is jinguan now RJ
[00:44:26] historically hasn't been benched he was
[00:44:28] not benched he was just he was exhausted
[00:44:32] so he took a little break from competing
[00:44:34] okay that's all that
[00:44:36] happened he just he was
[00:44:39] tired uh now he's back I actually took
[00:44:42] some time to gear him so he doesn't suck
[00:44:44] anymore uh he's only level 70 which
[00:44:47] means I don't even have um this but you
[00:44:50] know whatever um it it's
[00:44:54] fine and he has heon but our relics are
[00:44:59] really good now listen you why the [ __ ]
[00:45:01] are you on twopiece Hunter of glacial
[00:45:03] Forest listen listen listen if an ice
[00:45:06] character's best set is quantum then why
[00:45:08] can't the lightning character set be ice
[00:45:10] that that's not true however uh the the
[00:45:12] problem is we don't have so okay sub
[00:45:14] stats our sub stats on this set are
[00:45:16] really [ __ ] good look at this 166 uh
[00:45:18] on ice and then 20 crit damage on ice so
[00:45:22] you might as well it's just funny if we
[00:45:23] run substats and then two Beast
[00:45:25] lightning uh and then we have a good
[00:45:26] jinguan our ball is pretty good on Space
[00:45:28] stealing obviously inner SoDo is better
[00:45:31] um and our rope is okay it's actually
[00:45:32] oage business uh if you're unaware it is
[00:45:35] oage business I could plus 20 it or 15
[00:45:39] it but we'll wait a minute uh but you
[00:45:41] know he's pretty decent I wish I had 13
[00:45:44] six oh sorry 134 speed but we'll
[00:45:46] probably play with either ASA or Ting
[00:45:49] Yun uh and tenun does give some speed
[00:45:51] with uh uh uh her E1 so it is what it is

[00:48:19] to getting
[00:48:21] uh I mean yeah sure
[00:48:24] whatever
[00:48:29] oh [ __ ] I think we can do a
[00:48:35] temple okay these I know these traces
[00:48:37] are really [ __ ] cracked this one's
[00:48:39] the most important get [ __ ] follow up
[00:48:40] attack on your basic which is insane get
[00:48:42] some crit rate get some fire damage
[00:48:44] which is really good same thing
[00:48:48] here more damage fire and then crit
[00:48:52] rate then up here
[00:48:54] too
[00:48:56] this is an expensive ass crit rate
[00:48:58] though but we will get it we will get
[00:49:00] all of them I need to craft more of
[00:49:03] these
[00:49:04] first uh we'll make 28
[00:49:10] blues and
[00:49:12] then 40 no 36 purples dude I literally I
[00:49:16] was using these ASA needs the same I was
[00:49:18] literally leveling ASA a bit and she
[00:49:20] knew us the same M was
[00:49:24] annoying
[00:49:27] okay we need this for sure wait why am I
[00:49:29] out of the the mats for
[00:49:33] that I for sure need to get this but it
[00:49:35] costs 16 to unlock that is it worth yeah
[00:49:37] it's worth okay we'll do
[00:49:46] it the alerts where wait really I don't
[00:49:50] think they're muted are
[00:49:53] they no they should be muted
[00:50:00] anyways we're going to level talent and
[00:50:02] skill a lot but we going to level
[00:50:04] everything
[00:50:12] [Music]
[00:50:15] probably pay up
[00:50:19] listen I am not paying oh no Believers
[00:50:22] one okay I'll pay actually just cuz you
[00:50:25] guys are you have to wait another 5
[00:50:28] minutes another 5 minutes and if you
[00:50:30] complain I'm I'm giving it to doubters
[00:50:32] yeah test me test
[00:50:42] me I'll get everything to at least six
[00:50:46] and then we'll level the more important
[00:50:47] ones
[00:50:54] more wait I I don't have any [ __ ] how
[00:50:57] do I not have Tracks Of
[00:51:01] Destiny these things are
[00:51:10] easy doesn't do events okay I did every
[00:51:13] event except the last one cuz I needed
[00:51:15] to fully beat the archon quest to get it
[00:51:17] but every other event I did I've been
[00:51:19] doing the
[00:51:21] events I just I level a lot of
[00:51:23] characters dude look
[00:51:26] okay not him but like iner Boom Blade
[00:51:29] boom uh uh J
[00:51:35] boom archon Quest on whatever story
[00:51:38] Quest you know what I
[00:51:48] mean Arrow of the Demon
[00:51:51] Slayer conqueror of demons
[00:51:59] okay we need to get this for
[00:52:01] sure uh let me make more
[00:52:10] purples okay I think we can use her now
[00:52:13] we we'll probably get her alt to seven
[00:52:15] even though her Al's not that important
[00:52:17] I mean yeah it's not bad actually might
[00:52:20] as
[00:52:23] well okay
[00:52:27] okay basically dude we actually pre-
[00:52:29] farmed you guys are like usually there's
[00:52:30] like some cope going on where I can't
[00:52:32] level everything we actually prearm
[00:52:33] we're missing 6% fire damage which is a
[00:52:36] lot and to be honest I could probably
[00:52:39] get it right now if I want to I just
[00:52:41] don't know if I want to um but 6% is is
[00:52:44] is a decent
[00:52:47] amount topas
[00:52:52] friend should I get it chat do I press
[00:52:55] press the button or is it not worth the
[00:52:57] the the the mats Sur I do it right yeah
[00:53:00] I'll just do it okay the only reason why
[00:53:03] I might not do it is if I bench her but
[00:53:05] surely I don't bench her right surely
[00:53:07] you guys in like two weeks are going to
[00:53:08] be like k w bench topaz top bench enjoy
[00:53:12] top has flow po
[00:53:16] flow surely
[00:53:24] right
[00:53:31] okay I'll give the points to Believers
[00:53:32] now easy easy too easy for
[00:53:39] believers okay um we now have 60 crit
[00:53:43] rate 180 crit damage however we also get
[00:53:45] more crit rate through uh against
[00:53:48] enemies that are low HP but also we get
[00:53:51] more crit rate through fushen who we're
[00:53:53] going to be playing who uh gives us in
[00:53:56] this Talent right here up to 11 crit
[00:53:58] rate well 12 at uh max level but
[00:54:02] yeah speed mod check so num's speed is a
[00:54:05] fixed 80 but his speed gets influenced
[00:54:08] with uh like his action can get Advanced
[00:54:10] forward a lot which means that speed
[00:54:12] while it's still useful on her is not as
[00:54:14] important as crit and usually not as
[00:54:15] important as attack either so it's not
[00:54:18] that big of a deal we can still get 134
[00:54:21] and we can still run
[00:54:22] ASA but it's not as needed
[00:54:32] because toaz kind of like tobaz kind of
[00:54:34] sucks ball uh balls and then nummy
[00:54:36] carries you so you just want to like
[00:54:37] spam your Advance forward actions
[00:54:40] basically you just want your your numy
[00:54:42] to go as much as you
[00:54:45] can I like I'm going to my next shooting
[00:54:54] star
[00:55:02] dude that's so cute what the
[00:55:07] [ __ ] but yeah we might use ASA I just
[00:55:10] don't have her fully leveled so I think
[00:55:11] we're going to use um Ting Yun who's not
[00:55:14] really like worse or anything it's just
[00:55:17] you can't run I mean you could run
[00:55:18] planetary but yeah not for
[00:55:23] fire anyways
[00:55:28] uh we're not going to play the we're
[00:55:29] going to play
[00:55:35] for let me
[00:55:37] teleport uh where should we
[00:55:41] start let me teleport
[00:55:43] here also her Tech wait I just teleport
[00:55:46] to the same
[00:55:49] place do the trial first I can dude have
[00:55:52] you guys seen her technique her
[00:55:53] technique is [ __ ] broken
[00:55:55] also why does numy run so
[00:55:57] fast dude why does he run
[00:56:06] like dude he's kind of Caked
[00:56:16] Up
[00:56:18] anyways oh yeah I have a standard Temple
[00:56:20] I forgot or is it oh have a standard
[00:56:22] Temple maybe it's a guaranteed five star
[00:56:24] cuz ar70 maybe that's what you get at
[00:56:26] ar70 nope no it's not all right
[00:56:28] skipping oh we got luuka not
[00:56:32] bad oh
[00:56:34] Luca I hecking love
[00:56:39] Lucas scammed we have a single pull
[00:56:41] should I single pull I'll single pull
[00:56:42] I'm not skipping this
[00:56:45] one okay well it might be a
[00:56:53] fourstar okay
[00:56:55] well collapsing
[00:56:57] Sky can't wait to use that on my
[00:57:06] blade uh okay before we start we have a
[00:57:09] lot to do is this event should we do
[00:57:10] this event today is this school what is
[00:57:13] it hero wants you to go to the space
[00:57:16] station
[00:57:18] yep okay we will do
[00:57:23] it
[00:57:28] ordinary planes and final
[00:57:30] trial okay that's pretty cool oh wait we
[00:57:33] don't even have all of it yet
[00:57:35] sag should I wait till it's all out I
[00:57:37] mean we could just do day one today if
[00:57:38] we want but maybe I should stream again
[00:57:41] when they're all
[00:57:43] out
[00:57:45] okay uh
[00:57:53] okay
[00:57:55] you will end up missing it again what do
[00:57:58] you mean again I'm not going to [ __ ]
[00:58:00] miss
[00:58:02] it I'm not going to miss
[00:58:07] it I'm a star rail
[00:58:12] streamer okay I can whoa she has a gun I
[00:58:16] can talk about her and how you should
[00:58:17] build her and play her um but first I
[00:58:19] actually want to use
[00:58:21] her um but dude her [ __ ] technique
[00:58:24] for Overworld is just dude you literally
[00:58:27] have a Trotter that searches for [ __ ]
[00:58:30] Treasures for you and in simulated
[00:58:32] Universe you get extra curios and extra
[00:58:35] money and you can get extra
[00:58:40] credits Chad is Envy pulling for toat
[00:58:43] this is literally the Envy
[00:58:46] character like also code if you're
[00:58:48] [ __ ] do if you're doing like credit
[00:58:50] runs every day then extra 10K is like
[00:58:53] the most freeo playay but no life
[00:58:55] character in the
[00:59:02] world since you're tl70 you should
[00:59:04] already have all the chests unlocked
[00:59:06] right shut the [ __ ] up okay you you you
[00:59:10] keep your mouth
[00:59:16] closed but yeah it's actually pretty
[00:59:18] [ __ ] uh
[00:59:23] cracked
[00:59:25] this [ __ ] streams star like how
[00:59:28] streams genin only for wishes okay but I
[00:59:31] play the game a lot I just play it off
[00:59:32] stream cuz it's harder to like stream
[00:59:35] like Auto battling I don't know it's
[00:59:36] like harder to make content out of it
[00:59:38] other than like YouTube videos so I
[00:59:41] don't like I'll like Auto Battle [ __ ] or
[00:59:42] like do swarm or whatever the [ __ ] but
[00:59:45] it's like I don't stream it as
[00:59:53] much
[00:59:57] dude I literally play it on my phone
[00:59:59] like while I'm [ __ ] playing genin or
[01:00:01] while I'm playing like like watching
[01:00:05] something okay here's what we're going
[01:00:07] to do we're going to do one world six
[01:00:08] run to see if we can get a good fire or
[01:00:11] lightning ball then we're going to go do
[01:00:13] memory of chaos 10 then we're going to
[01:00:16] talk about how to build her probably
[01:00:17] before memory chaos 10 then we're going
[01:00:19] to go do um um um what is it called
[01:00:23] either either the new
[01:00:25] event or swarm I don't know yet or both
[01:00:29] we'll
[01:00:30] see but I need to get uh Fireball so
[01:00:32] we're going to do a quick run we're
[01:00:34] going to do we're going to play topaz
[01:00:36] though
[01:00:38] topaz jingu in we're un benching him
[01:00:41] actually un benched we actually un
[01:00:43] benched him actually un benched him uh
[01:00:46] normally I'd go ASA here but uh we're
[01:00:48] going to play t Yun and we're going to
[01:00:50] play
[01:00:53] fan he is going to lose now no we're not
[01:00:58] no we're not our team is actually
[01:00:59] cracked chat should I activate her E6
[01:01:01] yes or no I have E6 I just didn't
[01:01:03] activate it what is my stance on
[01:01:05] fourstar eidolons I don't activate the
[01:01:06] five star ones but should I activate the
[01:01:08] fourstar one Z remove the xation mark
[01:01:11] yes yes yes everyone say yes
[01:01:13] damn okay sure little bro did you unlock
[01:01:17] the path of propagation plent of content
[01:01:20] no I actually didn't I might do it but
[01:01:22] the reason why I didn't is cuz dude
[01:01:24] we've done I've cleared swarm maybe
[01:01:26] swarm I think two or three times at
[01:01:27] least two but maybe I think three and
[01:01:30] each time it's been with like without
[01:01:33] everything unlocked it's like actually
[01:01:34] really hard I saw that propagation path
[01:01:36] is like
[01:01:42] broken six on 13
[01:01:50] M wait what happened to my team comp
[01:01:52] where did it
[01:01:53] go they ruined my team no
[01:01:57] sorry okay ready chat this is the team
[01:01:59] we're running topaz 60 180 but we also
[01:02:02] get more CR raid from other sources so
[01:02:03] this is really like this is actually a
[01:02:05] lot more than 60 uh 61 obviously we
[01:02:07] could have more speed but suck my balls
[01:02:08] J pretty cracked also could have more
[01:02:10] speed ASA would be better here the more
[01:02:12] I think about this the more we want
[01:02:13] speed the more ASA would be better but
[01:02:15] [ __ ] you we're playing tun um boom uh
[01:02:18] you know it is what it is and then Jan
[01:02:20] could have more defense but HP and the
[01:02:21] the speed thresh is fine also dude you
[01:02:24] know what I saw that upset me look let
[01:02:25] me show you guys what upset me I saw
[01:02:27] something it made me so angry I
[01:02:29] literally I was in a boiling rage let me
[01:02:32] find it I saw a streamer that I once
[01:02:36] considered my friend someone that I
[01:02:38] thought was entertaining and relatable
[01:02:41] you guys might know him he who shall not
[01:02:43] be named okay code posted his Ting Yun
[01:02:47] build 3,500 HP 2600 attack almost 2,000
[01:02:54] defense and 171 speed what the
[01:02:58] [ __ ] how is this possible I replied I
[01:03:03] started following you for relatable
[01:03:05] free-to-play content that made me feel
[01:03:07] welcome but now all I see is an
[01:03:08] unrelatable tun build that I can never
[01:03:10] get because I work two full-time jobs
[01:03:12] true to feed my wife husband and kids
[01:03:15] you've changed code and you just lost a
[01:03:16] fan unsubbed
[01:03:21] true
[01:03:23] true
[01:03:25] but honestly
[01:03:28] um I just haven't like I haven't mid
[01:03:30] maxed the characters that like don't
[01:03:32] need crit I know that's like the most
[01:03:34] [ __ ] crit value thing to say but like
[01:03:36] dude I'm sorry okay this is disgusting
[01:03:39] don't look at that I'm sorry I don't
[01:03:40] know why I showed that I'm sorry but
[01:03:41] like okay I don't know how to explain it
[01:03:43] this piece gives me serotonin okay I
[01:03:45] look at this piece I am soaking okay but
[01:03:48] I look at like a good like I don't know
[01:03:50] what's a good like piece with a bunch of
[01:03:51] attack like this one's not that good but
[01:03:53] you know for example this one like it
[01:03:55] hurts me even though it's good for
[01:03:59] Kafka what's another piece I have do I
[01:04:01] have a good like an actual good piece I
[01:04:03] don't even
[01:04:06] know I don't know
[01:04:11] whatever anyways it's not even okay also
[01:04:14] I'm not even a it's not just like oh
[01:04:16] crit value Andy I literally never have
[01:04:19] enough Relic XP I don't know how
[01:04:21] [ __ ] have enough Relic XP to
[01:04:22] keep rolling piece this for all the care
[01:04:24] dude I don't have enough Relic XP I
[01:04:27] never do and I farm relics all the
[01:04:33] time all the
[01:04:39] time I I think it's cuz I have to gear
[01:04:41] every character cuz I make videos and
[01:04:43] stream so like I literally make I try to
[01:04:45] gear every character which is hard but
[01:04:47] like [ __ ] I know you can leave relics at
[01:04:49] plus 12 I know like I I know but it's
[01:04:53] like dude
[01:05:01] dude it's
[01:05:05] copium also you can't even like in genin
[01:05:07] you can kind of not level your flowers
[01:05:09] right like sure leave your flower like
[01:05:11] plus 12 and just dodge but in in Star
[01:05:15] you can't Dodge okay your tting Yun is

[01:06:52] speed though
[01:06:55] okay but speed is better okay attack I
[01:06:57] actually recommend attack on topaz
[01:06:58] usually but speed is like about 70% as
[01:07:01] good as it is otherwise would be or like

[01:22:08] books wait let me read something really
[01:22:09] quick I just want to make sure uh I want
[01:22:12] to read her skill
[01:22:16] again
[01:22:18] [Music]
[01:22:21] to
[01:22:33] okay so I feel like her skill is like I
[01:22:36] feel like just the passive part is
[01:22:38] cracked like using it is kind of like
[01:22:39] copium but
[01:22:41] the well using it chooses who you put
[01:22:43] proof of De on but if you even if you
[01:22:45] don't use it it puts it on someone and
[01:22:46] then you can just basic attack
[01:22:51] him
[01:23:01] like you could use it for energy for
[01:23:04] your ult but outside of that you just
[01:23:05] Spam normals but Basics unless the proof
[01:23:08] is on a different enemy or like like not
[01:23:10] on who you want it to be on cuz like
[01:23:12] against this guy it's already on him
[01:23:14] right so there's no real point to
[01:23:16] [ __ ] using my skill right talk this
[01:23:18] 32 months here we're going to buff sorry
[01:23:21] we're going to buff her
[01:23:23] why is my why am I slow easy then we're
[01:23:26] going to we don't even need to skill so
[01:23:28] we're just going to do that divination

[01:24:32] turn playing the long
[01:24:35] game we've been playing the long game
[01:24:38] and awaken there's no time to

[01:24:43] yes why do you never use it cuz it's the
[01:24:45] animation I don't like looking at it so

[01:35:41] Blazers your blessing Namy
[01:35:43] caros thanks
[01:35:50] Namy
[01:35:54] okay cool um I think we do memory of
[01:35:57] chaos we might get [ __ ] I can't lie
[01:36:00] there is a chance we get [ __ ] but I
[01:36:02] think we'll be okay the only problem
[01:36:05] is uh we have to Ungar our emiter like
[01:36:09] he still looks fine but he's he has not
[01:36:10] a plus zero uh thing and thing because
[01:36:13] we gave some of his pieces to Topaz uh
[01:36:15] but our blade is still really good and
[01:36:17] our jinglu is still really good as well
[01:36:18] as you can see and as you can see what I
[01:36:22] have 101 speed where's my bronia
[01:36:26] at
[01:36:30] [ __ ] my br's built for my other
[01:36:39] team chat I have a question chat I have
[01:36:41] a question can you can you can you can
[01:36:43] you listen to me when I speak please
[01:36:45] please no please I'm
[01:36:49] please I just got this piece okay but
[01:36:53] and it looks really good right this
[01:36:54] could be amazing for blade however we
[01:36:57] have a ball on Rudin Arena now that we
[01:36:59] just
[01:37:03] got so I they're kind of incompatible so
[01:37:06] I don't know if I should level the Rope
[01:37:07] or not does that make sense what do you
[01:37:08] guys
[01:37:14] think what is your salotto ball uh it's
[01:37:18] not
[01:37:19] bad it's this so like it has HP it has
[01:37:24] speed it's not bad it's just a bit worse
[01:37:26] crit value but we're not crit value
[01:37:28] Andes here we're not crit value Andes
[01:37:30] here we don't just care about crit value
[01:37:33] in this chat
[01:37:36] room yes you are okay
[01:37:39] well okay but we have 101 speed which
[01:37:42] means our BR if we want our BR to be
[01:37:44] slower than him unless we can overlap
[01:37:47] him like there's there's a speed amount
[01:37:48] where Bron can normal attack and then
[01:37:50] skill after but I don't feel like doing
[01:37:52] math uh which means arbr would need a
[01:37:55] lot less
[01:38:03] speed this indeed isn't double
[01:38:06] speed okay well we have silver wolf in
[01:38:08] the chat hello silver wolf welcome to
[01:38:10] the
[01:38:13] stream how are you
[01:38:20] doing
[01:38:22] how are
[01:38:23] you I'm I'm existing how are
[01:38:33] you so like for example let's say I
[01:38:36] remove these boots right for example
[01:38:37] we're still faster than blade so we need
[01:38:39] literally to have zero speed Subs on
[01:38:42] every single
[01:38:50] piece
[01:38:52] which is
[01:38:57] doable uh we would just have to
[01:39:00] go or make blade faster yeah but that
[01:39:03] would be even
[01:39:06] harder I have no crit damage on that
[01:39:08] though is pretty bad do I have a crit
[01:39:10] damage one I do but it's on silver
[01:39:20] wolf
[01:39:24] one second
[01:39:27] trat did you sleep well
[01:39:29] mic dude my blade doesn't have another
[01:39:31] build though like look at this dude look
[01:39:33] at this look at these [ __ ] gloves do
[01:39:35] you want me to remove these no no look
[01:39:37] at me and tell me with a straight face
[01:39:39] you want me to take this off I could go
[01:39:41] I could go speed boots but like this has
[01:39:43] 22 crit damage and I don't have good
[01:39:45] speed boots like they have no subs so
[01:39:47] like my blade build is like highkey
[01:39:49] Optimal I just need a slower
[01:39:53] ra yeah this rope sucks balls
[01:39:56] though like if my rope gave me some
[01:39:58] speed that would be that would be uh uh
[01:40:00] uh pretty pretty
[01:40:06] fire did you sleep
[01:40:09] well freak you sorry that was uncalled
[01:40:15] for okay uh let me just fix this bronia
[01:40:18] really
[01:40:19] fast we're going to filter by crit
[01:40:22] damage actually no we're not we're just
[01:40:23] going to yink pieces from
[01:40:27] people um this is
[01:40:32] fine I would want HP boots but I don't
[01:40:34] really have
[01:40:35] any there's a plus six one on Natasha
[01:40:38] there's plus 15 on um her but I don't
[01:40:41] want to take
[01:40:43] those do I have HP boots without
[01:40:49] speed
[01:40:57] dude we're literally okay we actually
[01:40:59] need more speed unless we have literally
[01:41:00] zero on Subs which is like lowkey
[01:41:04] impossible I
[01:41:09] mean one sec
[01:41:13] chat we are [ __ ] our Bron's
[01:41:19] build
[01:41:23] we still have 10 oh yeah we have two
[01:41:25] piece we need to remove one of the
[01:41:26] pieces
[01:41:37] um do I have a crit damage body that no
[01:41:39] one's using [ __ ] it has
[01:41:42] [Music]
[01:41:45] 7p dude why is this so hard what about
[01:41:47] this one oh but it's on
[01:41:49] jinglu
[01:41:51] am I using
[01:41:54] her feel like I'm going to use
[01:41:57] her
[01:42:11] [ __ ] why people saying no I'm going to
[01:42:13] use
[01:42:14] her just put plus zero n she's going to
[01:42:17] die if I put plus zero flower or body
[01:42:19] then the crit damage is like only thing
[01:42:21] that
[01:42:29] needs yes you could build your de but
[01:42:31] she'll do about as much damage built and
[01:42:33] unbuilt so keep that in mind just don't
[01:42:36] expect your damage to go
[01:42:49] up
[01:42:56] wait can I level this
[01:42:58] even 16.8 okay there's no way wait what
[01:43:02] is
[01:43:03] this uh that's flat HP do that get on

[01:43:08] it's not really
[01:43:09] good okay dude in what okay chat be
[01:43:12] honest with me there is no way this rope
[01:43:16] ends up worse than this right there's
[01:43:19] literally no way right

[01:43:28] way there's literally and when would I
[01:43:31] use two HP saloda ropes with there's no

[01:55:08] to nice then we Al nice sa it for me
[01:55:12] dude blade is so OAB boa you're have to
[01:55:18] think
[01:55:20] I failed all right
[01:55:24] cool nice not
[01:55:38] bad wait chat I have a question
[01:55:41] question you know how in a blade build
[01:55:44] Rudin Arena and iner Sal sto are pretty
[01:55:46] interchangeable in strength right
[01:55:48] they're very similar and about as good
[01:55:49] as one another do you think with the new
[01:55:51] characters like Jing Leu or if you're
[01:55:53] playing them for fall up attacks with
[01:55:54] topaz but especially with like jinglu
[01:55:56] right who can proc your follow up
[01:55:57] attacks more often would salotto be
[01:55:59] better than usual meaning it would be
[01:56:01] better than R and Arena because you're
[01:56:02] going to be full up attacking more so
[01:56:04] the damage bu your full up attack is
[01:56:05] more important than it normally is
[01:56:08] because if yes then I just got a rulin
[01:56:09] ball for
[01:56:16] nothing CU wouldn't you be doing F
[01:56:18] attacks more often
[01:56:22] still comes out to Subs yeah yeah
[01:56:23] obviously but I'm saying
[01:56:25] still cuz Okay the way it is initially
[01:56:28] is like they're both really close so
[01:56:31] like being able to fall Attack One More
[01:56:33] Time like one turn more
[01:56:39] often
[01:56:42] yeah
[01:56:44] noted my rope is so bad on ruent my rope
[01:56:47] is bad on ruent but my ball is is insane
[01:56:50] so I don't
[01:56:53] know uh what is oh this is this enemy
[01:56:56] again dude ever since they made this new
[01:56:59] memory of they literally added this
[01:57:01] enemy in the game made a new memory of
[01:57:03] chaos and we trying to show it off in
[01:57:04] every [ __ ] floor why is this [ __ ]

[01:57:55] Personnel I'm this team

[01:58:05] does that even
[01:58:08] mean what does that even mean bro is
[01:58:11] slandering his unpaid Discord mods on no
[01:58:15] not my Discord mods just Discord mods in
[01:58:18] general
[01:58:23] okay chat we're going to now play
[01:58:26] topaz uh okay we have to decide who
[01:58:29] we're buffing in this team though I
[01:58:31] think I think we're going to full buff
[01:58:33] topaz we're going to make jinglu look
[01:58:34] bad or jingu look bad but we're going to
[01:58:36] full buff our topaz I
[01:58:42] think
[01:58:44] um we're going to play this team on our
[01:58:47] freeto playay
[01:58:48] lonee
[01:58:51] why is this
[01:58:53] level you silly
[01:59:07] ah and we'll do merals nine and 10
[01:59:09] hopefully we don't
[01:59:12] die put ASA at that point yeah you can I
[01:59:15] I like ASA but I would need to level
[01:59:17] planetary rendevu and level her more I
[01:59:19] think but they're they're still pretty
[01:59:20] similar in strength cuz they both give
[01:59:22] you a lot of
[01:59:23] things I don't think ASA is strictly
[01:59:26] better there but I do think ASA is good
[01:59:39] there what if to has finally character
[01:59:41] that works with Yukon shut up stop stop
[01:59:42] stop stop making me play yukong stop
[01:59:46] stop stop stop
[02:00:01] up okay we're going to play
[02:00:05] uh fire weakness here but there's no
[02:00:08] lightning weakness which means jinguan
[02:00:09] is going to be kind of
[02:00:14] useless
[02:00:16] um damn I mean here there's a fire
[02:00:20] weakness and then here there's lightning
[02:00:21] weakness we could play our first
[02:00:25] half but the
[02:00:48] grunts
[02:00:53] you got himo
[02:00:55] right no we don't have
[02:00:57] himo uh we also don't have
[02:01:00] claraa two teammates that I wish I could
[02:01:02] play with
[02:01:07] her okay we're gonna do uh okay we could
[02:01:10] just play [ __ ] embor but I don't
[02:01:12] really want to so we're gonna okay we're
[02:01:14] gonna okay we're okay we're going to
[02:01:17] play
[02:01:18] topaz
[02:01:26] I mean I could play Jing Le I could do

[02:01:30] this kind of awkward I mean I could I'm
[02:01:33] sure it'll be no I removed her [ __ ]
[02:01:34] build never
[02:01:41] mind went for yaning over claraa shut

[02:01:58] all and we're going to play topaz with
[02:02:01] jinguan and we might lose okay there's a
[02:02:04] real chance we die if we do it is what

[02:02:17] uh
[02:02:19] what's nice here is we're well okay it's

[02:02:23] or
[02:02:24] Quantum but it should be fine uh the
[02:02:27] only downside is if we play dead hung

[02:43:10] attacker I want to use I don't have
[02:43:12] Clara I mean I can use J okay maybe I
[02:43:15] love
[02:43:16] I hate this lone I never want to use it
[02:43:18] again okay I think let me think let me
[02:43:20] actually cook let me actually cook let
[02:43:23] me give him like literally my best
[02:43:25] relics
[02:43:44] uh
[02:43:46] I don't have good speed boots for him
[02:43:48] which is the only
[02:43:52] problem did I get speed
[02:43:55] boots no I
[02:44:11] didn't I can also go attack boots [ __ ]
[02:44:14] it
[02:44:23] surely these roll good right Chad surely
[02:44:26] this rolls crit rate
[02:44:31] right
[02:44:44] okay
[02:45:01] I don't think we can even plus 15 this
[02:45:03] but we'll
[02:45:09] try you support claraa I am not
[02:45:13] borrowing someone's
[02:45:15] claraa that is not
[02:45:35] happening crit oo wait actually
[02:45:41] good our crit damage is a bit low here
[02:45:44] though
[02:45:46] our crit damage is a little
[02:45:48] low uh but there's not much we could do
[02:45:51] about it unless we get this to plus 15
[02:45:54] but I don't really have the MTH to do
[02:46:05] so dude these speed boots are so [ __ ]
[02:46:08] is it I feel like it's actually better
[02:46:10] to just go sub stats like I'm not joking
[02:46:13] I actually think it's better to just do
[02:46:14] this we lose 6% speed
[02:46:40] though
[02:46:44] yeah
[02:46:50] okay I mean at this point everyone's
[02:46:53] built except we have to choose between
[02:46:55] ASA and tting Yun ASA Buffs both at once
[02:46:59] but tingyun Buffs more also if we play
[02:47:01] ASA we would need to level
[02:47:07] planetary I mean do we even level this
[02:47:09] cuz that would only buff fire right and
[02:47:11] then this would buff all allies but
[02:47:13] energy regenerat is kind of not needed
[02:47:15] here so only we would want crit damager
[02:47:41] attack go meshing caul I could
[02:47:55] can you add yes please it's so passive
[02:48:02] aggressive you give him a decent build
[02:48:04] okay if unironically okay I'm like half
[02:48:07] joking the stream obviously this lon's
[02:48:09] like very mediocre but like if these sub
[02:48:13] stats with two two pieces obviously I
[02:48:16] could get 6% more speed if I get this
[02:48:17] two piece but if these sub stats aren't
[02:48:19] enough to make this character good then
[02:48:21] that's not on me
[02:48:24] anymore cuz my my imator and my blade
[02:48:28] and my jinglu are all better with worse
[02:48:32] granted their relics are better now but
[02:48:34] even when they were worse outside a jing
[02:48:36] Leu my jingu started
[02:48:42] good we can try again they have their L
[02:48:46] cone my
[02:48:49] imbi where is Emer is on a [ __ ]
[02:48:54] RS3 fall of
[02:48:57] anon blade has his
[02:49:07] though if you compare jinguan to kakomi
[02:49:10] one more time you will be not just
[02:49:11] banned but executed in game
[02:49:15] never talk to my wife like that again
[02:49:17] about my wife like
[02:49:20] that wrong
[02:49:30] place but they deal roughly the same
[02:49:33] amount of damage dude shut up that's not
[02:49:36] true that's not that's not true that is
[02:49:39] not true that is not
[02:49:43] true
[02:49:57] okay I have an idea let me cook okay let
[02:50:00] me
[02:50:04] cook do you want to enter the let me
[02:50:09] cook do you want to enter
[02:50:12] the okay I can obviously play and biter
[02:50:15] and it would be easy but here's what I
[02:50:17] think we do they're both fire we so we
[02:50:20] kind of have to do ASA so we're going to
[02:50:22] gear up our ASA we're going to make our
[02:50:24] ASA look good and do good our jinguan is
[02:50:27] not going to be able to do much cuz he
[02:50:28] resists
[02:50:32] lightning but it's
[02:50:34] fine cuz we don't have a better
[02:50:36] option so I think we have to use ASA
[02:50:39] here so we're going to make sure ASA I
[02:50:41] already mostly geared
[02:50:42] her uh but she's not fully geared so
[02:50:46] we're going to make sure she's okay you
[02:50:48] know uh obviously These substats suck no
[02:50:51] I think we just use this can I level it
[02:50:52] didn't I just level Something Bad [ __ ]
[02:51:03] it how much effect res do I have 24.6
[02:51:08] that's enough no we need 30 never mind
[02:51:10] why did I think it was 20 uh I could get
[02:51:12] enough on some ball though
[02:51:15] this one has 12 if I yink
[02:51:17] it could also level another
[02:51:26] one or I could go Fleet of the Ageless I

[03:14:49] cleared nine there pretty easily uh now
[03:14:52] we have to do 10 I don't know if I did I
[03:14:54] never done this rotation before I don't
[03:14:57] think why is there a [ __ ] truce thing
[03:14:59] here
[03:15:05] dude I have to regear and biter no
[03:15:11] no
[03:15:22] mosis
[03:15:24] aware we can also use jinglu yeah true
[03:15:27] actually yeah yeah true true true we
[03:15:29] don't need to regear
[03:15:32] danhong okay we can do that
[03:15:41] okay
[03:15:55] our Jing is really good we just [ __ ]
[03:15:57] her build a little bit stay in the
[03:15:59] middle don't want a riddle like you a
[03:16:01] little because uh we don't have many
[03:16:03] crit damage okay her crit damage body
[03:16:05] kind of sucks massive balls uh not just
[03:16:08] normal ones but massive ones uh however
[03:16:12] uh we need our Bron to be low speed if
[03:16:14] played with our blade because our blade
[03:16:16] is low speed but with Jing Liu our Jing
[03:16:19] Liu actually has oh we need we will want
[03:16:21] 134
[03:16:22] but could I get 134 in this
[03:16:29] build oh yeah this is the wrong rope oh
[03:16:32] she has my rope no sad I am so sad right
[03:16:36] now no oh
[03:16:41] no
[03:16:44] can I po with this yes or
[03:17:11] no
[03:17:13] okay uh we might just [ __ ] send
[03:17:16] it even if our speed's not 134 it's
[03:17:29] fine although speed boots with Asa here
[03:17:33] is probably not the
[03:17:39] play but these attack boots are kind of
[03:17:45] ass that's
[03:17:51] fine wait chat what would our team look
[03:17:53] like would we do like
[03:17:56] jinglu BR
[03:17:58] L and then do we blade [ __ ] it I'm not a
[03:18:02] blade we could also silver wolf and then
[03:18:04] just oh no we want a death Shredder
[03:18:05] actually we're playing Quantum set we
[03:18:07] have to pil okay we play pilo or silver
[03:18:10] wolf they're both fine
[03:18:13] uh do I have a preference here they are
[03:18:16] ice weak but he's also Quantum weak and
[03:18:18] we could
[03:18:19] implant
[03:18:21] um pila's more AOE we probably need the
[03:18:24] AOE I assume P's way better here
[03:18:26] actually if this thing so I haven't done
[03:18:28] memal since they changed it to swarm but
[03:18:30] if this thing mitosis
[03:18:32] is then pil would be way
[03:18:37] better yeah also ice
[03:18:41] shad
[03:18:49] what the [ __ ] is this I mean it doesn't
[03:18:52] really
[03:19:11] matter
[03:19:16] okay wait do I have an ER rope make sure
[03:19:19] I do
[03:19:22] okay and then we would do
[03:19:24] topaz so okay we if we if we're playing
[03:19:27] over here we do topaz ASA for sure cuz
[03:19:29] they're both fire we so really really
[03:19:30] good combo then I mean if I had claraa
[03:19:34] I'd probably put claraa here but I don't
[03:19:35] so we are going to play jinguan jinguan
[03:19:37] can help break uh this
[03:19:39] person and then our last slot is going
[03:19:41] to be fan
[03:20:02] is she geared I want to make sure she's
[03:20:09] fine yeah wait what's on Luca
[03:20:12] no it's
[03:20:26] worse they wind week okay we could play
[03:20:29] follow-up attack blade here but that's
[03:20:31] kind of dude no way you want me to play
[03:20:34] follow-up attack
[03:20:36] blade I mean he would probably still do
[03:20:38] better than anyone else in the team
[03:20:40] unironically cuz blade is cracked
[03:21:04] but we could do Jing on we'll try this
[03:21:06] for now we case we s have the
[03:21:09] blade all right let's try it
[03:21:16] uh this this
[03:21:21] this found your
[03:21:27] weakness okay time to get Vigilant time
[03:21:30] to get
[03:21:31] Vigilant
[03:21:35] sure okay that's good the market is Al
[03:21:39] here right after toaz took action I mean
[03:21:40] numy took action so now he'll get
[03:21:42] Advance forward uh that's fine that's
[03:21:46] fine yep numy my
[03:21:52] king
[03:21:54] okay okay we didn't have as's Al up yet
[03:21:58] but it's okay we should have it
[03:22:02] now
[03:22:03] everything these Trail Blazers your
[03:22:07] blessing okay okay okay still we should
[03:22:10] have enough skill points I didn't really
[03:22:11] do the math but but yeah yeah it is it
[03:22:12] is it is for sure we have enough cuz we
[03:22:14] can basically attack toaz
[03:22:17] I is the mark on did I just mess up
[03:22:22] as human

[03:32:12] one [ __ ] energy point I am going to
[03:32:18] scream oh we're fine boom hey we're fine
[03:32:22] will be revealed I had never saw that
[03:32:25] cut scene before in my life by the way
[03:32:27] that is the first time I ever see that
[03:32:29] normally with Jing you don't want to Al
[03:32:31] to get in your special stance you want
[03:32:32] to do it when you're inside of it but
[03:32:34] there I wanted to cuz I was like what if
[03:32:36] you know she just died but she did it
[03:32:37] doesn't matter died now it doesn't
[03:32:38] matter we won cool that was
[03:32:44] cracked never reach end no we beat swarm
[03:32:46] 5 a few times but I never I usually
[03:32:48] cleared the ads cuz I play in Lun and
[03:32:49] he's like and then they all die anyways
[03:32:52] we did
[03:32:59] it toas a nummy pretty fun but they feel
[03:33:03] okay I can give you my thoughts on her
[03:33:04] now um and tell you how to build her cuz
[03:33:07] I said I would today I just wanted to
[03:33:09] make sure I could actually clear content
[03:33:10] with her
[03:33:12] first before I started yapping I don't
[03:33:14] want to start yappity yapping before
[03:33:16] doing
[03:33:19] anything uh but I have to pee first so
[03:33:21] I'm going to pee while you guys look at
[03:33:22] topaz and nummy respectfully of
[03:33:25] course oh I should claim the jever
[03:33:38] forget hi this is TOA speaking
[03:33:48] she speaks every
[03:34:01] language hi this is to speaking
[03:34:09] you thing
[03:34:22] hi this is toat
[03:34:28] speaking
[03:34:30] Howa
[03:34:39] thing
[03:34:59] hi this is TOA
[03:35:02] speaking
[03:35:04] hi
[03:35:06] Howa
[03:35:09] thing
[03:35:24] I've
[03:35:26] returned hi
[03:35:29] chat D she's cuddling
[03:35:39] Nummy
[03:35:46] okay we're
[03:35:48] back so topaz and num
[03:35:53] be um okay here are my thoughts on her
[03:35:57] so far okay she's a hunt carry very
[03:36:00] single Target but her damage is pretty
[03:36:01] decent however she's not going to carry
[03:36:03] you as hard if you're playing as a hyper
[03:36:05] carry which you can and I've seen people
[03:36:07] do it it seems copium and it's not going
[03:36:09] to be as impressive as like the other
[03:36:11] hunt carries like Jing well she's
[03:36:12] destruction but even her as a carry or
[03:36:14] like literally any of the other carries
[03:36:16] as hyper carries will feel more like
[03:36:17] actual hyper carries then topaz what
[03:36:20] topaz can do though is have good single
[03:36:21] Target damage but also buff your fall up
[03:36:23] attacks which means if you run with
[03:36:25] another fall up attacker like claraa who
[03:36:27] I don't
[03:36:29] have or like jingu who I have an amusing
[03:36:33] or even like some other FL attackers
[03:36:35] like himo CFA blade kind of like they
[03:36:38] don't they're not like pure FL attackers
[03:36:40] but they can or like even her out
[03:36:42] whatever then not only will your toaz
[03:36:44] damage still be pretty good single
[03:36:45] Target but then you'll have other
[03:36:46] characters that can also have decent F
[03:36:49] attack damage but now it's
[03:36:50] better
[03:36:53] um
[03:36:55] so with that in
[03:36:58] mind she's cuddling on
[03:37:00] me also synergizes really well with Asa
[03:37:04] we'll talk about that later but ASA
[03:37:06] especially with planetary randevu uh is
[03:37:10] actually really good damage bonus and uh
[03:37:12] ASA also has idon that can help you out
[03:37:14] like uh well okay the idon just help you
[03:37:16] not lose your Stacks but the stacks help
[03:37:18] you a lot because you get attack and
[03:37:20] also speed through like speed through
[03:37:21] your alt attack through the stacks and
[03:37:23] really good Shield break against fire uh
[03:37:25] weak enemies so very good Synergy also
[03:37:28] one of her traces Buffs fire damage it's
[03:37:30] this one right yes fire damage of all
[03:37:32] your allies so boom boom boom which is
[03:37:34] dir
[03:37:35] p uh anyways though regarding toaz and
[03:37:39] numy
[03:37:40] here are the preliminary things you need
[03:37:42] to know first of all how do I build
[03:37:45] thanks for
[03:37:46] asking for reference I wanted to mention
[03:37:49] this I do still plan on making full star
[03:37:51] rail guides I've just been like
[03:37:52] traveling a lot cuz it's con season and
[03:37:53] focusing on genin for that so I'm making
[03:37:55] shorter videos here or like on stream
[03:37:59] but I will make longer ones for future
[03:38:00] characters so keep that in mind but for
[03:38:02] now here's what you need to know lon's
[03:38:03] very [ __ ] easy either you pull for a
[03:38:05] signature or you use your freeo play
[03:38:07] cruising in the Stellar SE S5 which you
[03:38:09] can get and super post for at her a
[03:38:10] store that's it you don't need to know
[03:38:12] know more however if you have Sword Play
[03:38:14] S5 it's about as good they're very
[03:38:16] similar usually it's like slightly worse
[03:38:18] but it can also depend on uptime of the
[03:38:21] effect generally they're both really
[03:38:23] good stat sticks uh really good those
[03:38:25] are like the only two options you should
[03:38:26] be using outside of your signature your
[03:38:28] signature uh is pretty good let me pull
[03:38:31] it up so I can show you guys the stats
[03:38:33] CU I don't have the
[03:38:35] memorized
[03:38:39] um yeah yeah it gives
[03:38:51] you
[03:38:52] yeah bad guide maker listen it's been a
[03:38:55] while since I read it I saw so the C put
[03:38:58] this only a little bit better it's like
[03:38:59] 5 to 10% better than the cruising in the
[03:39:02] Stellar C S5 it's so okay this lyone is
[03:39:06] pretty good cuz it gives you a ton of
[03:39:07] stats more damage crit rate crit damage
[03:39:09] and just damage on your followup attacks
[03:39:12] okay which is good cuz topaz and numy
[03:39:15] they're followup attacking character
[03:39:17] right numy is most of your damage
[03:39:19] however as far as comparing this to like
[03:39:22] cruising in the Stellar SE is a really
[03:39:24] good statti okay at S5 which you can get
[03:39:26] for free you get 16 to 32 crit rate 16
[03:39:31] always another 16 if they're under HP
[03:39:33] and 40% attack when you defeat an enemy
[03:39:36] this could be even just a weak enemy uh
[03:39:39] in memory of chaos for example there
[03:39:40] like a big one and then a small one you
[03:39:41] just kill the small one right so it's a
[03:39:43] lot of stats which is why cruising the
[03:39:45] Celler C and sword play aren't that far
[03:39:47] off of your signature lyone at S1 okay
[03:39:51] signature lyone is still the
[03:39:52] best um but it's not that much better
[03:39:55] also yes something I do want to point
[03:39:57] out uh is that this does increase uh uh
[03:40:02] the damage of your allies as
[03:40:04] well because yeah
[03:40:08] uh yeah this also will increase you're
[03:40:10] so if you're running another carry with
[03:40:12] topaz which you typically will be doing
[03:40:14] they will get more damage as well so it
[03:40:15] can be a like more team DPS I'm not
[03:40:17] calling this likeon bad right it's it's
[03:40:19] pretty good but it's not like you need
[03:40:22] it it's not like the biggest uh upgrade
[03:40:24] especially because there's already
[03:40:26] really good options really good stat
[03:40:27] sticks that you can use on like any Hunt
[03:40:29] character like cruising in the cell se
[03:40:32] but wait let me mute alerts for this
[03:40:34] sorry I appreciate it though J thanks
[03:40:35] for 16 months not Don wal uh but it's
[03:40:39] definitely still a good upgrade if you
[03:40:40] want okay with that in mind oh you can
[03:40:44] also use C's uh hunt lone it's just a
[03:40:46] stat stick but it's usually not that
[03:40:48] good for her it's a static it's fine but
[03:40:50] I still would recommend cruising uh or
[03:40:52] Sword Play S5 generally speaking okay
[03:40:56] for her relics now don't look at mine
[03:40:58] right now well they're not bad but
[03:41:00] here's actually they're fine yeah
[03:41:01] they're actually fine for her relics
[03:41:03] this is what you want okay
[03:41:06] setwise you want usually two two piece
[03:41:10] fire with two-piece attack and or uh
[03:41:13] two-piece speed instead of attack maybe
[03:41:15] is fine as well if you want speed but
[03:41:17] generally Two Fire and two attack are
[03:41:19] what you go for now you might be like Z
[03:41:20] What The Hell she's a fire character why
[03:41:22] aren't you going the four piece fire set
[03:41:23] okay four piece fire set makes no sense
[03:41:25] what even is this increases skill damage
[03:41:28] sure but you're not really Skilling on
[03:41:29] topaz you use your skill maybe once if
[03:41:32] you want to like reapply the like you
[03:41:34] use your skill like once to change the
[03:41:35] mark from one enemy to another if you
[03:41:37] want to you don't like need to spam your
[03:41:39] skill your B basic attacks or follow up
[03:41:40] attacks you're typically with your
[03:41:42] passive that you're going to unlock
[03:41:43] you're typically just basic attack
[03:41:45] spamming then when you alt your fire
[03:41:48] damage is increased you might be like oh
[03:41:50] for how long for a turn two turns for
[03:41:52] one attack sorry I'll calm down one
[03:41:56] attack what so it's like viable like if
[03:41:59] your four piece has really good substats
[03:42:01] sure okay but it's not better than
[03:42:04] twopiece fire with two piece attack or
[03:42:07] even two piece fire with two piece speed
[03:42:09] especially if you can get one three four
[03:42:10] speed which is a nice break point for
[03:42:11] memory of chaos um to go twice in one
[03:42:13] cycle or uh even going for musketeer is
[03:42:17] fine CU you get basic attack damage and
[03:42:19] speed and attack percent which is
[03:42:21] basically just like going two speed with
[03:42:22] two attack but you also get some basic
[03:42:25] attack damage which isn't the biggest
[03:42:26] deal but you know it's free so there's a
[03:42:30] lot better options I'm running twopiece
[03:42:31] twopiece uh and you should go based on
[03:42:33] sub stats with that in mind a lot of
[03:42:36] people are typing sus in my
[03:42:37] chat I'm just G to say there is a good
[03:42:40] chance that we get something catered
[03:42:42] towards follow-up attackers at some
[03:42:44] point okay keep that in mind there
[03:42:45] probably will be something catered
[03:42:46] towards followup attackers but for now
[03:42:47] twb twopiece is what you should go for
[03:42:49] your uh set the the the the ball and
[03:42:52] sphere the planet ornaments what was
[03:42:54] that Intero is great because it
[03:42:57] increases your fall attack damage which
[03:42:58] is most of your damage like a big chunk
[03:43:00] and your ultimate which is okay um it
[03:43:04] also gives you 8% crit rate very nice I
[03:43:05] recommend inal stto go with this for her
[03:43:07] however obviously substats are very
[03:43:09] important so if you don't have it you
[03:43:10] can go space stealing station where is
[03:43:13] it I can't find it uh because this gives
[03:43:15] you 24% attack which is not bad you can
[03:43:18] alternatively go rulin arena for basic
[03:43:20] and skill damage but it's not as good
[03:43:21] and 80% crit rate so it's not useless
[03:43:23] it's just not quite as good uh inner
[03:43:25] soda is the best and space stealing is
[03:43:27] second best you could also technically
[03:43:29] go like the support sets but I don't
[03:43:30] really like that okay for the stats
[03:43:34] you're looking for here's what you
[03:43:37] want crit is King crit crit is the best
[03:43:40] for your damage okay crit Buffs you it
[03:43:42] Buffs numy numy your little piggy he's
[03:43:44] the goat it Buffs both of you okay you
[03:43:47] want crit now attack is also really good
[03:43:50] for you okay attack helps increases both
[03:43:52] of your damage really good as well crit
[03:43:54] and then attack uh and then also speed
[03:43:56] all of these stats are these are like
[03:43:58] the four stats on this piece are the
[03:43:59] stats you're looking for okay crit's the
[03:44:01] best then attack and speed for most
[03:44:03] carries I value speed up until at least
[03:44:05] 134 or whatever break point you're going
[03:44:07] for a lot I value speed a bit more than
[03:44:09] attack for most carries at least to a
[03:44:12] certain amount for topaz it's not quite
[03:44:15] the same speed's still good but numi has
[03:44:17] a fixed speed of 80 but his uh actions
[03:44:20] will be Advanced forward as you do like
[03:44:23] like attacks on your other characters
[03:44:24] your alt helps with that and then your
[03:44:25] allies uh attacks will advance your
[03:44:27] nummy forward as well and then outside
[03:44:29] of that it's your topaz that will
[03:44:30] advance your num's action forward so
[03:44:32] speed will still help your numy go more
[03:44:34] often uh and will help topaz herself go
[03:44:38] more and and Advance your to your nummy
[03:44:42] more I'm trying to word this correctly
[03:44:45] but it's not as efficient as on some
[03:44:47] other carries that want speed more
[03:44:48] because nummy as I said has a fixed
[03:44:50] speed so typically attack is a bit more
[03:44:53] valuable but again if you're close to
[03:44:55] breakpoint like one three4 speed is
[03:44:56] still good also for your boots um you
[03:44:59] might be like okay speed or attack right
[03:45:01] again it depends but I also recommend a
[03:45:03] lot of time running ASA and ASA speed
[03:45:06] Buffs you and so you can get to these
[03:45:07] speed break points you can get high
[03:45:09] speed through your ASA and a few sub
[03:45:11] stats instead of needing a main stat
[03:45:13] again go on substats though like I'm
[03:45:14] using speed cuz my substats are better
[03:45:16] but uh especially because I use her with
[03:45:18] Asa I would probably go attack boots
[03:45:20] right generally for your main stats
[03:45:22] though crit body either crit rate or
[03:45:23] crit damage uh attack or speed boots I
[03:45:26] recommend attack a bit more than with
[03:45:27] some other characters but speed is still
[03:45:29] viable
[03:45:31] Fireball attack is okay cuz attack is
[03:45:33] actually valuable on this character by
[03:45:35] the way I want to emphasize that attack
[03:45:36] is good um it helps you a lot it giv you
[03:45:39] more damage but crit is uh sorry fire
[03:45:40] damage is generally just the best ignore
[03:45:43] these sub stats I know it's it's
[03:45:45] atrocious and then for your rope just go
[03:45:47] attack you don't really want the ER tack
[03:45:50] is just better and uh that's pretty
[03:45:53] cool uh what else I want to talk about
[03:45:55] isons again I don't usually go into too
[03:45:57] much depth but your first idolon is good
[03:45:59] it's a pretty decent amount of damage
[03:46:01] it's like 10 to 20 uh% more it will let
[03:46:04] me read it again de
[03:46:08] state
[03:46:10] yeah it so not only is it that damage
[03:46:12] bonus to your
[03:46:16] uh sorry please edit that
[03:46:31] out anyways uh you can so okay what this
[03:46:34] does it'll increase the full up attack
[03:46:36] damage that the enemy that uh is marked
[03:46:39] by your numy like your skill marks an
[03:46:41] enemy right uh whichever enem is marked
[03:46:43] will take more damage more crit damage
[03:46:46] by full attacks so your nummy will do
[03:46:48] way more damage other follow attacks
[03:46:50] will do way more damage pretty good
[03:46:51] definitely a good E1 not needed but a
[03:46:53] nice upgrade if you want it uh but
[03:46:55] that's not what we're here to talk about
[03:46:56] overall build pretty simple uh traces
[03:46:58] level all them make sure you get these
[03:47:00] These are really important most of these
[03:47:01] are really good like more damage against
[03:47:03] fire weakness that's great your base
[03:47:05] attacks are com into follow attacks
[03:47:06] that's huge uh this one is more energy
[03:47:08] but like well I mean that's you know you
[03:47:10] want that so all of these are great
[03:47:12] especially this one uh and all of your
[03:47:14] talents are worth leveling however uh
[03:47:16] talent and skill are the most important
[03:47:18] and then the other two are are you might
[03:47:20] as well as well so
[03:47:22] yeah what does someone first time
[03:47:24] message in chat how many drugs can I use
[03:47:27] her with my Linny dude what is wrong
[03:47:29] with you guys today anyways that's how
[03:47:31] you built her
[03:47:33] um for her teams this is very important
[03:47:36] okay this is really important cuz I
[03:47:38] think you can get get a like you can get
[03:47:41] very low value out of topz Andy if you
[03:47:43] don't build her teams correctly okay I
[03:47:46] think
[03:47:47] generally you want to play her with
[03:47:50] another followup attacker and then a
[03:47:52] buffing Harmony support or a debuffing
[03:47:54] nil support and then a Healer or
[03:47:56] shielder okay generally now there are
[03:47:59] alternatives you can also do like a
[03:48:02] hyper carry hunt build which is like
[03:48:05] okay I'm just going to do one Harmony
[03:48:07] character like ASA or tenun then either
[03:48:10] another one like both of them or a
[03:48:11] defense Shing nil like silver or Pila
[03:48:14] and then a Healer and then you play her
[03:48:15] like you play like [ __ ] cely or any
[03:48:17] hunt carry yanching whatever well yaning
[03:48:18] needs a shield but just a hunt carry and
[03:48:21] then she's like hyper carrying but in my
[03:48:23] experience that's like a bit less
[03:48:25] they're a bit underwhelming compared to
[03:48:27] playing for fall up attacks but then
[03:48:29] also buffing another fall up attacker
[03:48:30] right a new character could come out
[03:48:32] that's good on fall up attacks boom what
[03:48:33] if they work with topaz andami they
[03:48:35] probably will so a character that has a
[03:48:37] lot of synergy with current characters
[03:48:38] and also future ones for now I recommend
[03:48:41] running her with a fall attacker now you
[03:48:43] might be like okay well what fall
[03:48:45] attackers can you use uh let me range
[03:48:47] the order so she's in the middle cool
[03:48:50] what attackers can use Clara is probably
[03:48:52] the best because her damage is really
[03:48:53] good also swar help me Mr SWOG can like
[03:48:56] you know she's like tanky very easy very
[03:48:59] comfy I don't have claraa so sad I can't
[03:49:02] play her I also don't have heo who we're
[03:49:03] going to talk about but clar is
[03:49:04] typically like the best here jingu is
[03:49:06] also a good option um my genu has
[03:49:09] historically been mediocre but I I
[03:49:11] cleared memory C 10 I'm about to show
[03:49:13] you guys that right after this not bad
[03:49:16] with our
[03:49:16] jingu and it works well because Jan most
[03:49:19] of his damage comes from the lightning
[03:49:21] Lord which is a follow attack and toaz
[03:49:23] bu follow attack damage so POG also a
[03:49:26] lot of these characters that I'm
[03:49:27] mentioning like well not all of them but
[03:49:29] uh some fall attackers like jinu do a
[03:49:31] lot of AOE damage right lightning Lord
[03:49:33] hits everyone erudition character topaz
[03:49:36] very single Target heavy which means
[03:49:38] topaz will help single Target against
[03:49:39] bosses and then if there's a lot of
[03:49:41] enemies topaz will feel a bit weaker but
[03:49:43] jinguan will will work there because
[03:49:45] jinguan is good against a lot of
[03:49:47] enemies uh outside of that you want okay
[03:49:50] wait other options include other fall
[03:49:52] attackers like cfco who can surprisingly
[03:49:54] work despite her mostly being played in
[03:49:56] The Hil teams she can work here uh just
[03:49:58] fine you could also use technically
[03:50:00] blade again feels like a weird option
[03:50:02] but blade is in my opinion just a really
[03:50:04] strong carry that because of that and he
[03:50:06] doesn't really use many skill points and
[03:50:08] because he has a good follow at he can
[03:50:09] work um you could technically use yaning
[03:50:13] although I haven't tested that so this
[03:50:15] might be wrong don't quote me on that
[03:50:16] but you can use basically any fall up
[03:50:17] attackers you can use heo which actually
[03:50:20] is pretty good also fire Synergy
[03:50:22] especially with Asa but then you're
[03:50:23] running three Fire characters so if the
[03:50:24] enemies aren't fire weak I wouldn't
[03:50:26] recommend that um or you could do both
[03:50:29] of them with silver wolf and then
[03:50:30] implant
[03:50:31] fire uh you could also do just generic
[03:50:35] fa attackers even like again well I
[03:50:38] don't want to say play her but like if
[03:50:39] you want to you can uh like any F attack
[03:50:43] basically any F attacker will get better
[03:50:45] with topaz Andy cuz your F attack damage
[03:50:48] is higher however I recommend characters
[03:50:50] like claraa jinguan good fall attackers
[03:50:52] or any of the other ones that I
[03:50:53] mentioned uh work the best here a
[03:50:56] character like himo despite her not
[03:50:57] being meta gets better here right if
[03:51:00] you're like oh I really want to play her
[03:51:01] you can okay sorry I'm not trying to
[03:51:04] slander Hera I'm sure Hera's fine you
[03:51:06] can play Hera okay if you want to play
[03:51:07] Hera and
[03:51:09] you can you can you can play her with
[03:51:11] her I'm just my point is full of attacks
[03:51:13] can work even kind of March 7th but
[03:51:15] that's copium but yeah any fall of
[03:51:17] attacker for your support options this
[03:51:19] is important listen up children listen
[03:51:21] up Support options Harmony I highly
[03:51:24] recommend ASA or Ting Yun they are both
[03:51:27] really good tingyun can only buff one
[03:51:29] character at a time for the most part um
[03:51:32] but this is really good a lot of damage
[03:51:34] a lot of energy and this is really good
[03:51:36] a lot of attack and also skill point
[03:51:38] efficient cuz you can basic attack while
[03:51:40] your uh uh blessing benediction lasts
[03:51:42] for three turns and just a pretty good
[03:51:45] character overall okay uh also her
[03:51:48] eidolons give you like more energy and
[03:51:49] stuff pretty pretty good and speed with
[03:51:51] E1 uh ignore her build I gave her relics
[03:51:53] to ASA but yeah t really good ASA also
[03:51:56] really good not only underrated option
[03:51:58] but also good in general and especially
[03:52:00] good with topaza numi my personal
[03:52:02] favorite option with her
[03:52:04] because you can run her on planetary
[03:52:06] Rendevous which gives you uh fire Dam
[03:52:09] Dage bonus right it'll it'll buff the
[03:52:11] same damage type as the wear has 12 to
[03:52:13] 24% obviously other lyones are viable
[03:52:15] too but this one's great you can also do
[03:52:16] meshing cogs for energy or or whatever
[03:52:19] right a lot of good supportive options
[03:52:22] and you get a bunch of speed which is
[03:52:24] really nice right instantly boom you
[03:52:26] meet your speed requirements and a bunch
[03:52:28] of attack through uh your uh Stacks from
[03:52:31] your skill now also this gets a lot more
[03:52:33] consistent with eidolons but even
[03:52:35] without them it is what it is uh still a
[03:52:38] great option especially against fire
[03:52:39] weak enemies and you get this which I
[03:52:41] talked about earlier 18% damage just
[03:52:43] fire damage which is great so I really
[03:52:46] like AA pretty good stuff DPS uh and
[03:52:48] just support in general especially if
[03:52:50] built correctly good weapon um and
[03:52:54] against enemies that are fire week
[03:52:55] especially like the current memory chaos
[03:52:56] 10 where ASA literally carried us um tun
[03:53:00] also really good though I think they're
[03:53:01] both like similar bronia doesn't work as
[03:53:04] well here cuz you can't really make use
[03:53:05] of the extra turn as much still fine
[03:53:07] like Bron is never bad you get crit
[03:53:09] damage you get an extra turn whatever
[03:53:11] but the the buff from your skill doesn't
[03:53:13] uh it only lasts for one turn and it's a
[03:53:16] buff to Topaz not to nummy kind of like
[03:53:18] with jinguan still but here it's like I
[03:53:21] would say it's even a bit worse but it's
[03:53:22] fine right you get crit damage attack
[03:53:24] it's fine uh and yeah like you can get
[03:53:28] more nummy turns cuz you can like topaz
[03:53:31] attack then BR then topaz again so I
[03:53:33] don't even think BR is bad like
[03:53:35] genuinely I think BR is always good
[03:53:36] always no matter what so like you you
[03:53:39] can make it work but in this but I would
[03:53:41] use braon on your other team and then
[03:53:43] use either ASA or tingyun on this
[03:53:45] team uh niil sub Wars work fine too but
[03:53:49] yeah especially if you have an extra
[03:53:54] slot uh if you're playing ASAS she can
[03:53:56] buff all your characters at the same
[03:53:57] time if you're playing Ting Yun you kind
[03:53:58] of have to choose like let's say you're
[03:54:00] playing Jen and uh toaz andami you'd
[03:54:02] have to choose who you're Skilling who
[03:54:04] you're alting they can depend on the
[03:54:05] situation if you want more single Target
[03:54:06] or more AOE but yeah
[03:54:09] um for your healer literally play anyone
[03:54:12] I actually really like fuen if you have
[03:54:14] her not just cuz she's like pretty
[03:54:16] broken in general but also um not only
[03:54:18] is she skill point efficient but she
[03:54:19] also gives you a lot of Buffs like you
[03:54:21] get crit rate uh which is huge right
[03:54:23] obviously more damage but
[03:54:26] also uh you'll you know you'll tank a
[03:54:28] lot of damage uh and you'll heal your
[03:54:31] team passively and well I guess the main
[03:54:34] thing is just skill point
[03:54:36] efficiency so yeah skill point
[03:54:40] efficiency anything else I want to
[03:54:43] mention I think that's pretty much
[03:54:46] it
[03:54:48] E1 yeah but like do you have E1 I mean
[03:54:50] if you have E1 is 30 crit damage but
[03:54:52] obviously if you have E1 you're using
[03:54:58] her uh but like you don't need her
[03:55:00] obviously like fan great Lua also great
[03:55:03] but you could use like even freeo playay
[03:55:05] supports like you could you could just
[03:55:06] use Natasha or Lynx I love lyx if you
[03:55:08] have her links is great uh but pretty
[03:55:11] much any support or shielder can
[03:55:13] work yukong is not even worth the
[03:55:15] mention yukong is
[03:55:17] like yukong with eidolons and speed
[03:55:20] tuned can like work but
[03:55:24] like I don't want to get into
[03:55:26] it if you want to go ahead but I
[03:55:29] recommend and I'm sure it'll be fine but
[03:55:31] I recommend I I
[03:55:33] I it is very Niche and I recommend Te
[03:55:36] You ASA generally speaking my links is
[03:55:38] level 20 but I will level her I
[03:55:42] promise
[03:55:44] okay uh with that in mind I am now going
[03:55:47] to do memory of chaos I already recorded
[03:55:49] this on stream but I'm going to for the
[03:55:51] video I'm going to pretend like I
[03:55:52] did memory of chaos with my toaz umy
[03:55:55] obviously my crit rate is a little low
[03:55:56] but I get more from this effect and I
[03:55:58] get 12% with uh well it's not 12 cuz
[03:56:01] it's not level 10 but it would be 12%
[03:56:02] crit rate from fuen so the C rate is
[03:56:04] actually higher than it seems um our
[03:56:06] build is pretty good now the only thing
[03:56:08] is is I wish I had um attack boost
[03:56:12] instead of speed cuz ASA gives us a lot
[03:56:14] of attack but uh a lot of speed rather
[03:56:16] and attack but mostly speed but it's
[03:56:18] fine still good uh our crit body could
[03:56:20] be better some of our pieces like this
[03:56:21] ball is terrible so it's not like the
[03:56:23] most investment but still good we're on
[03:56:25] a free tolay ly cone uh relatively like
[03:56:28] kind of relatable investment but like a
[03:56:30] piece like this is insane so it's like a
[03:56:32] middle ground uh AR jingu has been
[03:56:34] historically mid but I geared him for
[03:56:36] this um so arjin is also going to be
[03:56:38] doing well obviously I only have one
[03:56:40] two-piece but I went for sub stats on
[03:56:41] the other pieces cuz my lighning set
[03:56:43] sucks but um honestly not
[03:56:46] bad this L cone kind of sucks but it's
[03:56:48] the best one we have
[03:56:52] so is there anything else for to remove
[03:56:55] chat no this is a second Channel video
[03:56:56] it's not a main Channel video it's fine
[03:56:58] we're not like uh try
[03:57:03] Harding how can ball be terrible dude
[03:57:05] I've been farming in Sal stto oh yeah
[03:57:07] also for we were supposed to be on iner
[03:57:09] Salo but we're going off sub stats cuz
[03:57:12] we don't have a good iner salso ball uh
[03:57:14] my lightning ball look at my lightning
[03:57:15] ball my inero ball yeah it has attack
[03:57:18] but it l dude like what is this okay
[03:57:20] attack and then my rope sucks too so
[03:57:21] whatever but we went space stealing
[03:57:22] which is better for
[03:57:26] us
[03:57:28] yeah yeah yeah woohoo
[03:57:37] sorry
[03:57:45] lost HSR stream before whoohoo release

[04:06:34] long do you think the delay of the
[04:06:35] stream's going to be obviously we don't
[04:06:36] know but trying to figure figure out
[04:06:38] what my next stream's going to be cuz I
[04:06:39] would stream in like a day or two
[04:06:41] normally and and probably do genin but
[04:06:43] if the live stream is like early I would
[04:06:45] stream that
[04:06:46] next I guess we don't know I'll upate
[04:06:48] you guys in Discord
[04:06:51] then let me look it up let me see if
