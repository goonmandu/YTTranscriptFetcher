[00:21:36] want to be able to listen
[00:21:45] say although Kevin's size is not big but
[00:21:47] the form is kind of nice
[00:21:49] um kind of like who else it doesn't
[00:21:51] matter but it is a big butt and the
[00:21:52] point is I don't know like the music in
[00:21:55] game is nice but it pauses sometimes
[00:21:57] like drink cutscenes or like it'll be
[00:21:59] like really quiet at times so I don't
[00:22:01] know if you guys actually want that
[00:22:04] [Music]
[00:22:09] that's why it's like yeah it's like
[00:22:11] [ __ ] sorry
[00:22:13] it's really scuffed origin
[00:22:16] um
[00:22:23] look who it is
[00:22:26] okay I gotta calm down I actually can't
[00:22:28] do any clippable material in this if I
[00:22:30] do anything that can be clipped while
[00:22:31] wearing this my reputation is [ __ ] for
[00:22:33] the food I bought an external to have
[00:22:37] enough space so the screenshots

[00:22:55] shipment of goods I'm on my way to
[00:22:57] report back

[00:23:22] the in-game I have to Turning Game up
[00:23:23] came in here Dale she's whispering
[00:23:27] I'm starting to feel sad just thinking
[00:23:29] about it

[00:23:32] escort you two what do you say
[00:23:36] sounds good oh also another important
[00:23:39] disclaimer of today's stream

[00:23:46] has to say I'm sorry if you're a pie my
[00:23:48] lover good for you I didn't ask we might
[00:23:50] like read some of it but like I I if
[00:23:52] it's an eight hour stream and 30 minutes
[00:23:55] of it is pymon I might as well save half
[00:23:56] an hour
[00:24:03] I see common dialogue isn't bad in front
[00:24:05] end dude
[00:24:08] dude pains is and then everything in
[00:24:09] case you didn't read if we're gonna pay
[00:24:11] attention we don't need pymon's [ __ ]

[00:26:05] people in chat you guys were like dude

[00:26:07] Quest and if that's true then we have
[00:26:09] Scara for whatever Movement we need and
[00:26:11] then we don't need Elon in which case we
[00:26:13] might as well uh bring Mr hyphen along
[00:26:14] just because it's I'll hide them
[00:26:17] um and uh yeah so this is our team we
[00:26:20] have double Animo for the the resonance
[00:26:22] and then just a Healer and then a hide

[00:27:16] louder

[00:27:28] Mr socks can you PLS play a pipe falling
[00:27:31] down sound also the reason why I wanted
[00:27:33] to do the archon question today is to
[00:27:35] get the weeklies before the week resets
[00:27:36] but there is no [ __ ] way we have time
[00:27:39] so minus another week of [ __ ] Subaru
[00:27:42] commissions but it is like fonten but it
[00:27:44] is what it is it is what it is uh it is
[00:27:46] what it is
[00:27:49] it is what it is
[00:27:56] yeah
[00:27:59] it is what it is man
[00:28:06] hey girl are you amazed
[00:28:10] oh this must be fontaine's porch
[00:28:15] everything looks so
[00:28:17] defontaine so I heard
[00:28:22] this is nice but maybe it would be
[00:28:25] better if we found something to do also
[00:28:27] okay
[00:28:30] more disclaimers before we begin more
[00:28:33] disclaimers before we begin
[00:28:39] so
[00:28:41] I haven't watched anyone play this I
[00:28:44] managed to mostly avoid spoilers the
[00:28:45] only spoiler that I got was by hoyovers
[00:28:47] themselves when they [ __ ] showed like
[00:28:49] our look you know being like oh look at
[00:28:52] my children and stuff so that's the only
[00:28:54] thing that I've really seen uh like the
[00:28:57] only thing is like you know
[00:28:59] ah you know there's probably two [ __ ]
[00:29:03] losers that are in the fatoui but that's
[00:29:04] all that's literally all that's
[00:29:05] literally all that I've seen uh other
[00:29:07] than that
[00:29:08] yeah I think we're chilling I don't
[00:29:10] actually know what happens I saw the
[00:29:11] picture of like I saw the picture of of
[00:29:13] of Farina but outside of that it's a
[00:29:18] Pity that has never happened still his
[00:29:20] story is quite the tear-jerker
[00:29:25] not at all excuse me can I help you
[00:29:28] donated one could help but notice he's
[00:29:31] standing here listening what
[00:29:35] we're Travelers new to Fontaine and we
[00:29:38] had something we wanted to ask but you
[00:29:40] seem to be really busy talking about
[00:29:42] some kind of play so we didn't want to
[00:29:45] interrupt okay play Bulls oh no no no
[00:29:48] okay you guys are saying don't skip but
[00:29:50] I really care about what ICN has to say
[00:29:52] no one talks about it's young the only
[00:29:55] thing that can compete with balls is wow
[00:29:59] a real trial
[00:30:04] okay
[00:30:08] like thrilling Tale
[00:30:10] harboring
[00:30:14] ulterior motives
[00:30:15] whether something is true or not simply
[00:30:18] isn't that important the main thing is
[00:30:20] whether the story being acted out he's
[00:30:22] already bored no I'm not I'm not bored
[00:30:23] I'm not bored
[00:30:27] of justice is called the Opera epicles
[00:30:30] are more commonly known as just the
[00:30:33] Opera House the [ __ ] is that epic
[00:30:35] Claires but that's two friends for me
[00:30:37] I'm sorry I've never used that word in
[00:30:39] my life
[00:30:51] oh there's a thousand bits it's nice
[00:30:54] to Fontaine have wondered the same thing
[00:30:56] you could say that we just don't want to
[00:30:58] waste the moving stories behind those
[00:31:00] cases and ask for your words
[00:31:04] we have the absolutely just an honorable
[00:31:07] chief justice okay as well as the aura
[00:31:10] trees I don't know why they pronounce
[00:31:11] his name like that well actually I
[00:31:13] didn't hear how she pronounced it
[00:31:15] between the
[00:31:17] machistas false charges okay Injustice
[00:31:19] are a thing of the past now
[00:31:25] what a [ __ ] name I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:31:28] that's a [ __ ] terrible name
[00:31:31] is it some kind of machine too wait
[00:31:35] none of us forgot to ask you a question
[00:31:37] um do you know what we should do if we
[00:31:39] want to meet the hydraulic huh
[00:31:42] that's easy just go to the opera house
[00:31:45] lady Farina practically lives there you
[00:31:47] could definitely say it's her biggest
[00:31:48] okay also before we meet Farina and
[00:31:52] before I even have a take on her because
[00:31:54] I actually don't know I will say that no
[00:31:56] matter what no matter what her
[00:31:58] personality is
[00:32:00] you guys are gonna send for her because
[00:32:03] of what we saw in the trailer that's all
[00:32:06] I'm gonna say so I like if I don't like
[00:32:09] her I'm I will be afraid to say anything
[00:32:11] but I haven't met her yet so I don't
[00:32:12] know I'm just saying I'm just saying
[00:32:14] hopefully she's cool
[00:32:17] what I mean is that they wish to speak
[00:32:19] with the archon personally
[00:32:24] afraid it's going to be a tad more
[00:32:26] difficult you'll have to make an
[00:32:28] appointment well you can make an
[00:32:29] appointment with the [ __ ] archon she
[00:32:31] has any time slots
[00:32:33] she like a dentist
[00:32:37] no no lady Farina seldom takes an
[00:32:40] interest with the nation's Affairs
[00:32:41] reason it's difficult to make an
[00:32:43] appointment is simply because she's
[00:32:45] incredibly popular that's right
[00:32:48] after all she is okay all right the
[00:32:51] fame's gonna get to her head from time
[00:32:52] to
[00:32:58] meanwhile venti's just running around
[00:33:00] drinking wine
[00:33:08] probably no honestly like I really I
[00:33:10] don't even know free like no leaks but
[00:33:13] if foreign
[00:33:14] I'd be surprised
[00:33:17] even if farina's kid is like
[00:33:19] hey just play Hydro strangling's
[00:33:22] probably still good hang on
[00:33:24] the fontaines are con you're talking
[00:33:26] about you should show
[00:33:28] you can [ __ ] Play Shiny with nilu man
[00:33:30] I guess I should at least try to be a
[00:33:33] little more respectful in front of
[00:33:34] visitors
[00:33:35] otherwise I might get arrested and find
[00:33:38] myself face to face with masua
[00:33:40] nouveaulette wait you just need you need
[00:33:43] to get a wait if you get arrested in the
[00:33:45] Vietnam but nobody's going to be
[00:33:47] arrested for saying something yo yo how
[00:33:49] do I commit a crime kill these guys
[00:33:52] at least we now know that we can find
[00:33:54] the Hydraulics wait isn't it like a
[00:33:57] truly's not a cop truly's like a judge
[00:34:00] or something
[00:34:03] I mean Risley had [ __ ] handcuffs
[00:34:07] judge yeah but he had it
[00:34:09] oh I guess he said face to face with
[00:34:12] nive yet Risley arrests you brings you
[00:34:15] to navient and then it's like time for
[00:34:17] the dick of Justice
[00:34:25] oh

[00:35:08] okay weird POV but all good there's
[00:35:10] nothing I can do but just keep my
[00:35:11] troubles to myself okay I was just
[00:35:13] running
[00:35:16] the kids
[00:35:17] it was just atop that hill over there oh
[00:35:20] you have a brother
[00:35:23] [Music]
[00:35:24] wait
[00:35:29] no people call the waters around
[00:35:31] Fontaine a sea it's actually just an
[00:35:33] inland Lake that's filled with fresh
[00:35:35] water you know I can still see that Hill
[00:35:38] clearly imagine you see from anators
[00:35:39] drowning no with his [ __ ] helmet on
[00:35:45] tossing sand in the Wind
[00:35:47] but now
[00:35:49] gradually swallowing our memories
[00:35:53] it won't be long before it swallows us
[00:35:58] a professional diver yeah but
[00:36:00] okay but you've watched the trailer you
[00:36:02] know what I mean
[00:36:03] I don't believe oh funny pleasure of
[00:36:05] meeting Melanie are you Lynette new
[00:36:08] friends hi Lenny
[00:36:11] I am Lenny of the Knights of football
[00:36:14] after my sister she often comes here to
[00:36:16] reminisce about our childhood that's all
[00:36:18] there's no need for any concern
[00:36:21] allow me to introduce myself all right
[00:36:24] Lenny and this is my sister Lynette if I
[00:36:27] had to guess I'd say You must be
[00:36:29] travelers from abroad
[00:36:32] you but how do you know our name how
[00:36:34] does he know her name is traveler this
[00:36:37] guy is good he's actually a magician
[00:36:38] this guy is good this guy is Houdini
[00:36:42] even though we didn't really get what
[00:36:44] she was saying
[00:36:45] hmm I see it's unusual for Lynette to be
[00:36:49] so willing to talk with anyone in fact
[00:36:52] she's seldom speaks it all I'm usually
[00:36:55] the only one she ever talks to
[00:36:59] it's like a magician Duo where one never
[00:37:01] talks and the other one never stops
[00:37:03] talking
[00:37:05] the pen and Teller of genjun impact
[00:37:09] uh okay so that's how you think it is I
[00:37:13] also think my brother can be too
[00:37:15] talkative at times oh
[00:37:18] seems you were right pymon we are quite
[00:37:21] similar oh can we have a linion set up
[00:37:24] I'm on I'll trade you I'll trade you
[00:37:25] Lynette please take her please
[00:37:32] golf YouTube
[00:37:34] okay
[00:37:36] oh that it's from a prophecy that's been
[00:37:39] circulating in Fontaine for some time
[00:37:41] now
[00:37:42] well I suppose prophecy isn't exactly
[00:37:45] the right word because that implies a
[00:37:47] certain amount of uncertainty there's no
[00:37:50] doubt about what's happening in Fontaine
[00:37:51] now
[00:37:52] let me check something really fast
[00:38:00] uh okay sorry what's happening in fall

[00:46:48] then as the God of Justice
[00:46:52] shall face this traveler in another kind
[00:46:56] of duel a duel in court
[00:47:02] right now that'll be worth seeing
[00:47:06] surprise this is Fontaine after all such
[00:47:10] a great shut the [ __ ] up it's him I'm
[00:47:11] sorry
[00:47:14] good night dude she's literally a twitch
[00:47:17] streamer
[00:47:24] they haven't committed any crimes
[00:47:27] no we have reason to put you on trial
[00:47:32] it's obvious isn't it obvious according
[00:47:35] to Fontaine law no one is permitted to
[00:47:38] release any flying objects within
[00:47:40] Fontaine City Limits during the first
[00:47:42] three days well does it Focus no
[00:47:45] September fourth oh well it's past
[00:47:47] midnight I don't know if that counts
[00:47:48] it's September 4th now was it not before
[00:47:51] [ __ ] what they've done wrong
[00:47:54] that's our lady Farina no one knows the
[00:47:58] laws of Fontaine like she does
[00:48:05] wait
[00:48:06] why not yet
[00:48:09] [Music]
[00:48:10] precisely now if you two have no
[00:48:14] objections then in the name wait noise
[00:48:16] for pymon dude that's kind of [ __ ] we
[00:48:19] didn't even know the laws we just got
[00:48:20] here my apologies lady Purina I don't
[00:48:23] mean to spoil the fun but if you would
[00:48:26] allow me to interject I don't think that
[00:48:28] pymon here meets the definition of a
[00:48:31] flying up thanks Lenny
[00:48:34] is crazy
[00:48:40] [Music]
[00:48:46] I actually wrote an essay about how
[00:48:49] ignorance isn't a legal defense but it
[00:48:51] should be because not okay not it should
[00:48:53] be but like example let's say they just
[00:48:55] pass a law like they pass the law in
[00:48:56] Montreal where like homeless people can
[00:48:58] sleep on benches so then the homeless
[00:48:59] people didn't know so a bunch of
[00:49:00] homeless people just got arrested
[00:49:01] because they just passed the law and
[00:49:02] then they arrested a bunch of them so
[00:49:03] like I actually got an A plus in this
[00:49:05] because it's like why the [ __ ] was that
[00:49:06] a Thing If No One's Gonna want what
[00:49:07] they're [ __ ] homeless do they have a
[00:49:09] book telling them the laws no how would
[00:49:11] they know so it's [ __ ] up if you just
[00:49:12] pass a law and you're like [ __ ] you you
[00:49:14] should know this anyways so what she's
[00:49:16] doing is kind of weird because like we
[00:49:17] just got here how the [ __ ] would I know
[00:49:18] but then also you could be like oh well
[00:49:20] I didn't know and then you Rob I get it
[00:49:22] but whatever it doesn't matter
[00:49:25] magician who just reigned on your parade
[00:49:28] actually should
[00:49:34] bothered here allow me to perform a
[00:49:37] trick for everyone oh a trick
[00:49:40] Yay good job Lenny
[00:49:45] we're pyro pyro traveler oh
[00:49:48] never mind
[00:49:49] [Music]
[00:49:55] she has a leash
[00:49:58] thanks Lenny
[00:50:03] whoa whoa whoa whoa
[00:50:05] whoa whoa whoa what is this
[00:50:13] there as you can all clearly see pymon
[00:50:17] should be classified as well something
[00:50:20] like a balloon this rope has been in the
[00:50:22] Traveler's hand all along it was huh
[00:50:25] [ __ ] you called that magic shut the [ __ ]
[00:50:29] up Rina
[00:50:33] again again
[00:50:36] sure what to think
[00:50:39] oh she's pissed she's pissed how dare
[00:50:42] you talk back to a god I am a
[00:50:44] [Laughter]
[00:50:49] musing very amusing okay she enjoyed it
[00:50:53] never mind she enjoyed it sort of
[00:50:54] unexpected twist twist that I enjoy with
[00:50:57] you here today's performance can finally
[00:51:00] be called complete the Judas likes
[00:51:02] content she just wants to be entertained
[00:51:04] I respect that
[00:51:05] for in which case consider the matter of
[00:51:09] your trial I respect that
[00:51:11] the God of Justice will not bring
[00:51:13] charges against an innocent person but
[00:51:16] when there are valid grounds I will not
[00:51:20] only judge travelers from abroad but
[00:51:23] even the gods of other lands
[00:51:28] what
[00:51:30] I look forward to seeing your upcoming
[00:51:32] performance at the Opera House Mr Lenny
[00:51:35] and Miss Lynette
[00:51:37] enough for now toodaloo did you just
[00:51:40] toot to Lewis
[00:51:42] I like your outfit it's pretty cute
[00:51:48] wait why does she think she's a Hydra
[00:51:50] Arcon though I thought that was kokomi I
[00:51:52] mean just look at kokomi it has to be
[00:51:53] her
[00:51:58] what she's going
[00:52:00] well
[00:52:02] it's the most unpredictable archon
[00:52:04] pymon's ever seen
[00:52:07] or anything but that's a problem for
[00:52:10] future pymon
[00:52:15] so I did a little preparation just just
[00:52:18] in case I didn't think why don't we just
[00:52:21] bring [ __ ] um why don't we bring
[00:52:22] yente with us she could learn all the
[00:52:23] fun time laws you see what kind of God
[00:52:25] lady Farina is
[00:52:27] she can be a bit confusing at times but
[00:52:29] she is still amenable to reason
[00:52:32] amenable like Amino oh no it's a Nemo
[00:52:37] I'm gonna [ __ ] wrong one there's a
[00:52:39] spoiler you guys aren't supposed to hear
[00:52:41] I added the Toyota Corolla
[00:52:44] you're not supposed to hear this yet
[00:52:45] added Toyota Corolla well I was talking
[00:52:47] to Sergeant
[00:52:50] the letter
[00:52:54] spoilers
[00:52:56] right I just know a few simple I like
[00:53:00] Lenny's I used to make a living Lynette
[00:53:03] is my assistant and Lynette
[00:53:06] it will actually be my first time
[00:53:07] performing on the most prestigious stage
[00:53:09] in Fontaine cool Opera House [ __ ]
[00:53:13] ing I just woke up what the [ __ ] is
[00:53:15] happening here
[00:53:18] when there are no public trials being
[00:53:20] held the Opera okay cool cool cool cool
[00:53:22] cool cool
[00:53:25] to the people of Fontaine the line
[00:53:27] between a trial and a performance can be
[00:53:30] a little blurred dude it's literally
[00:53:32] they're like streaming oh my God they
[00:53:34] stream content it's either drama or it's
[00:53:36] like a trial or they stream like
[00:53:37] performances dude farina's just a
[00:53:39] streamer I'm telling you I would watch I
[00:53:42] would watch I would be remiss to forego
[00:53:44] this opportunity gifted by Fate my
[00:53:47] brother is always excited to make new
[00:53:49] friends
[00:53:51] sure wait her eyes kind of look like the
[00:53:53] abyss wait let me wait let me look at
[00:53:55] the gun in that case why don't we go
[00:53:57] together I'll show you the way I just
[00:54:00] have something to take care of first it
[00:54:03] literally looks like Spiral of this like
[00:54:05] not like the portal but like the Met
[00:54:06] like the magic whatever perhaps you can
[00:54:09] help me distribute them to the people
[00:54:10] here
[00:54:12] uh
[00:54:14] uh this sucks but okay
[00:54:24] you asked me before about the prophecy
[00:54:26] right let me start by telling you he
[00:54:29] gives a bag to everyone everyone in
[00:54:31] front that has a bag then our lakino
[00:54:33] appears turns the bags into bigger bags
[00:54:36] kidnaps all of them steals all of
[00:54:38] Fontaine true I'm not sure exactly when
[00:54:41] it began but a prophecy has been
[00:54:43] circulating around Fontaine
[00:54:48] [Music]
[00:54:50] no matter how the nation of Justice
[00:54:53] holds trial after trial this sin cannot
[00:54:56] be absolved until one day the water
[00:54:59] levels in Fontaine will rise and the
[00:55:02] sinful people will slowly be drowned
[00:55:04] okay in the end the people will all be
[00:55:07] dissolved into the waters and only the
[00:55:10] hydro archon will remain weeping on her
[00:55:13] throne
[00:55:14] only then will the sins of the people of
[00:55:17] Fontaine be washed away wait what that
[00:55:21] sounds pretty gloomy why
[00:55:24] are pinfontaine born with sin what is
[00:55:27] that supposed to mean
[00:55:31] there are lots of guesses some say that
[00:55:34] the ancestors of Fontaine stole the
[00:55:36] power so Farina is like sad and
[00:55:37] depressed but she she covers it up by
[00:55:40] being funny and goofy never heated the
[00:55:42] first Hydro archon's warnings and
[00:55:44] defended Celestia I understand you
[00:55:47] Fontaine evidence
[00:55:49] there hasn't been concrete evidence for
[00:55:52] any of these claims so they can only be
[00:55:54] regarded as conjecture
[00:55:58] people in aware
[00:56:09] but in the last few years the water they
[00:56:12] just freeze it hire [ __ ] Kaya get a
[00:56:14] cryo dude
[00:56:16] yo bring some crowd people over yo Chong
[00:56:19] Yoon what's up man
[00:56:21] many places have already been completely
[00:56:24] submerged and now lie Beneath the Sea
[00:56:27] many people carry on with their lives as
[00:56:29] before and shrug it off as a natural
[00:56:31] phenomenon but my family and I think
[00:56:34] that wait so is faltender's fighting
[00:56:36] global warming
[00:56:37] which would end up sentencing them to
[00:56:39] death if you hope that at least the
[00:56:42] people who reside my brother doesn't oh
[00:56:44] it's too late so we started Distributing
[00:56:47] match ing magic Pockets to them
[00:56:49] as a magical item these magic Pockets
[00:56:52] have astonishing capacity I'm sure they
[00:56:55] will come in handy when people are
[00:56:56] moving their belongings okay surely it's
[00:56:59] nothing else
[00:57:04] but this is more than a bit of rain
[00:57:09] I don't trust these bags but outside of
[00:57:11] that okay cool or could ever contend
[00:57:13] with such a catastrophe
[00:57:19] is rising thanks
[00:57:21] surely they do if you'd like to help
[00:57:23] then please give these magic Pockets to
[00:57:26] anyone nearby all right be sure we'll
[00:57:28] help you Lenny
[00:57:31] like watered okay I didn't have time to
[00:57:33] read that distribute magic pockets and
[00:57:35] nearby residence is that it's Yen yo
[00:57:38] what's up Tim
[00:57:39] my main man it's in the blonde traveler
[00:57:43] that everyone's been talking what's up
[00:57:45] man

[00:57:50] I can't remember seems you really
[00:57:52] thought of everything

[00:57:56] and hope for the best okay I close my
[00:57:58] Google tabs oh please also thank the
[00:58:01] Magician on my behalf all right I will
[00:58:03] I'll thank Winnie for you

[00:58:14] what's this ah so you also believe in
[00:58:18] the prophecy what no no I believe in the
[00:58:21] prophecy

[00:58:27] people once lived nah brother the water
[00:58:30] isn't Rising time war on people desired
[00:58:33] to live on land and developed blood
[00:58:36] vessels encapsulating the sea within
[00:58:39] their bodies okay thus good people set
[00:58:42] foot on land okay so if you ask me and
[00:58:46] the water rises and takes up oh this guy
[00:58:48] just this is [ __ ] Kyogre he just
[00:58:49] wants the water to take us this guy just

[00:59:20] watch she's gonna be the opposite
[00:59:22] way I see it if the prophecy is true oh
[00:59:25] never mind it's still gonna be a long
[00:59:27] time before the water can cover
[00:59:28] everything
[00:59:29] life is all about living I might use it

[00:59:47] thanks
[00:59:48] it's just that
[00:59:50] if I start moving that means I've
[00:59:53] already given up on the life I have now

[01:03:07] but it seems she's very all right five
[01:03:09] gifted betting that we're gonna catch
[01:03:11] her and then she's gonna have a sad
[01:03:12] backstory I'm sorry my child is he needs
[01:03:15] bread to eat watch watch and then we're

[01:03:42] no but don't steal from a random
[01:03:43] civilian that's different like
[01:03:45] anyways
[01:03:53] future lawyer okay listen I could
[01:03:55] probably make a defense your honor and
[01:03:57] my client was starving he needed food
[01:04:00] versus uh your honor my client like
[01:04:03] stole from an innocent in-game don't do
[01:04:06] that just I'm just saying
[01:04:08] also if you can't afford bread you're
[01:04:10] not gonna hire a lawyer I mean I guess
[01:04:12] you'd have an attorney like given to you
[01:04:13] but then those people it is what it is
[01:04:16] get ready to stop her
[01:04:20] [Music]
[01:04:26] okay
[01:04:28] [Music]

[01:04:33] right she might also be trying to lure
[01:04:36] us away
[01:04:38] you wait but there's no sign of the
[01:04:40] thief
[01:04:47] let's go find Lenny

[01:05:23] bet
[01:05:29] all right Auto no that was all oh I
[01:05:33] can't thank you enough anyway I should
[01:05:37] be going now
[01:05:40] oh were you returning with the FIFA
[01:05:42] stolen
[01:05:44] that's right pity I wasn't able to catch
[01:05:47] her
[01:05:47] she distracted me by dropping the things
[01:05:49] she stole On The Ground by the time I
[01:05:52] looked back she was a little sauce
[01:05:54] I saw the general direction she went but
[01:05:57] Lenny twisted his ankle and I needed to
[01:05:59] make sure he was okay what just check on
[01:06:02] him after
[01:06:03] you hurt
[01:06:06] me I'll be all right what a shitty story
[01:06:09] I don't know why you would lie about
[01:06:10] something like that so maybe it's
[01:06:11] telling the truth but that's a sad story
[01:06:13] if you want to play it being oh yeah
[01:06:14] Lenny twisted his ankle and then I had
[01:06:16] to stop and see if his ankle was twisted
[01:06:21] sauce
[01:06:25] sorry Lynette I have to admit that the
[01:06:29] thief was even more skilled than I had
[01:06:30] anticipated but at least we were able to
[01:06:32] get the stolen items back so it wasn't a
[01:06:35] complete failure
[01:06:38] it's been an hour and he's 10 minutes in
[01:06:40] okay shut the [ __ ] up surely we're like
[01:06:42] halfway done the First Act surely we're
[01:06:45] like halfway done the First Act
[01:06:47] I'm not interrupting dialogue I want to
[01:06:49] hear what they have to say don't say
[01:06:51] where 10 minutes in also we started the
[01:06:53] Arkham Quest around 30 to 40 minutes
[01:06:55] into the stream we're like so let's say
[01:06:57] 30. okay so there is a little bit of
[01:06:59] time for leeway
[01:07:02] foreign okay
[01:07:04] What's Happening Here
[01:07:14] 's way to get around this is an aqua bus
[01:07:18] it allows people to travel between
[01:07:20] several key locations around Fontaine
[01:07:22] okay it's pretty convenient but the ride
[01:07:25] can become a little dull after a while
[01:07:26] the scenery is always the same that's
[01:07:30] why it's better to travel with friends
[01:07:31] nope I mean it's a bus that's what you
[01:07:34] expect even when I'm riding with you
[01:07:38] damn no that's not what I meant it's
[01:07:41] just that uh well you don't really talk
[01:07:43] that much
[01:07:45] it doesn't really feel like a real trip
[01:07:47] when it's just the two of us it's the
[01:07:50] same as being at home
[01:07:53] um L brother
[01:08:03] time for us to leave let's get on board
[01:08:11] okay
[01:08:12] oh
[01:08:14] it looks like again oh it's true yeah
[01:08:15] Charlotte I was like yeah okay
[01:08:19] what's up Charlotte she's on the [ __ ]
[01:08:21] bus with us oh she is she's on the
[01:08:24] fortnite battle bus
[01:08:36] I like the bird on her thing wait we're
[01:08:38] never guessed I'd bump into you
[01:08:43] wait the background is moving as we're
[01:08:45] swimming what if I never would go past
[01:08:46] the dialogue will we get to the next
[01:08:48] location or is it just gonna keep
[01:08:49] looping like because okay we just passed
[01:08:51] the pillar what's gonna what's gonna
[01:08:52] pass next oh wait I'm not I don't know
[01:08:57] it is Auto
[01:08:59] all right whatever
[01:09:02] it's surprising that nobody knew we were
[01:09:04] coming
[01:09:05] okay
[01:09:08] no no need for interesting wait when did
[01:09:10] we okay I know we met Charlotte in like
[01:09:12] an event but wasn't that time gated if
[01:09:15] you didn't do the event when was the
[01:09:16] last time we met Charlotte because in
[01:09:17] the dialogue she was like oh nice to see
[01:09:19] you again
[01:09:22] oh dialogue changes if you didn't do it
[01:09:23] oh okay okay okay it makes sense of a
[01:09:25] reporter if I didn't know who they were
[01:09:27] it's a pleasure to meet you I'm
[01:09:29] Charlotte a reporter for the steam bird
[01:09:30] hello Charlotte
[01:09:33] nice to meet you from the steam bird huh
[01:09:36] we've often relied on your paper to
[01:09:38] promote our performances
[01:09:42] it's an honor to meet you
[01:09:44] now that everyone knows each other
[01:09:46] Fontaine suddenly doesn't feel like such
[01:09:48] an unfamiliar place
[01:09:50] so what have you been up to lately Chef
[01:09:53] not too much when there isn't any
[01:09:54] breaking news I mainly cover the trials
[01:09:56] at the opera house okay you could still
[01:09:58] manage to keep readers attention as long
[01:10:00] as you tell things from a clever enough
[01:10:01] angle even if it's the same old time
[01:10:03] dumb they're just recycling contents how
[01:10:06] a scammer wants to see
[01:10:08] girls into relationships or how a
[01:10:10] financial criminal was once so poor that
[01:10:13] they ate a single piece of bread for
[01:10:14] five days bum
[01:10:16] but that's not really the kind of news
[01:10:18] you're after
[01:10:20] you know me pretty well what I'm really
[01:10:23] after is exclusive Sensational news
[01:10:25] pieces that could shake the country
[01:10:27] these smaller stories are a waste of my
[01:10:30] talents okay I just remembered I've been
[01:10:33] following a case lately well a series of
[01:10:36] cases actually you mean the serial
[01:10:38] disappearances of young women okay okay
[01:10:40] okay okay no spoilers in chat or you
[01:10:43] will be banned no fake spoilers either
[01:10:45] for this whole thing but I feel like
[01:10:47] whenever it's like two people and like a
[01:10:49] detective and we're like talking I feel
[01:10:51] like the case she's on is about them
[01:10:53] again no spoilers I don't want to know
[01:10:56] if I'm right or wrong but I feel like
[01:10:57] Charlotte's probably like looking for
[01:10:59] them or some [ __ ] probably or like
[01:11:01] arlikino who's like we'll see
[01:11:04] because mysterious disappearances of
[01:11:07] people I don't know if she said I don't
[01:11:08] know what she said but disappearances
[01:11:10] I'm sorry
[01:11:11] we'll see I bet all the other reporters
[01:11:14] will shed tears of envy
[01:11:16] I've already gathered all kinds of
[01:11:18] materials I just can't wait for the
[01:11:20] truth to be revealed
[01:11:24] yeah literally
[01:11:31] okay serial disappearances that is a
[01:11:33] monkey
[01:11:36] for 20 years ago what the [ __ ] and
[01:11:39] period of time this has been happening
[01:11:41] for 20 years are you in cash how bad of
[01:11:43] a detective is this nation you have the
[01:11:45] [ __ ] God of Justice dirt bro 20 years
[01:11:51] but the scariest part is that to this
[01:11:53] day but we caught the torian like a week
[01:11:55] well we didn't catch him but
[01:11:58] we we beat starters [ __ ] Mech in like
[01:12:01] two days have been arrested over the
[01:12:03] years in connection with this case but
[01:12:04] shortly after each arrest another they
[01:12:07] don't have Hazel true
[01:12:10] uh it must be more than one criminal yes
[01:12:14] but either way I believe that every case
[01:12:17] has some precise truth behind it waiting
[01:12:19] to be exposed yes I agree and at the
[01:12:23] very least the family of those missing
[01:12:25] girls deserves some sort of explanation
[01:12:28] that is a weird response to that Lenny I
[01:12:30] just imagined for a second what I would
[01:12:31] do well I would be more concerned about
[01:12:33] the missing girls but you know families
[01:12:35] are cool too I guess and then find a way
[01:12:37] to track down the culprit
[01:12:41] please don't imagine that imagine going
[01:12:42] up to someone be like yo did you hear
[01:12:44] this person's missing you're like yeah
[01:12:45] we should talk their family deserves an
[01:12:47] explanation it's like ah I mean yeah but
[01:12:50] you know it's been 20 years yeah I mean
[01:12:53] that's fair I guess it has been a long
[01:12:54] time but
[01:12:56] I'm just saying that is a weird response
[01:13:10] has been 20 years
[01:13:16] yeah Lenny also looks like 10 so there's
[01:13:18] no way he he committed a crime 20 years
[01:13:21] ago
[01:13:23] dude the trailer showing our lakino
[01:13:24] pushing them [ __ ] with me now I'm
[01:13:26] thinking it's all of them are like you
[01:13:27] know
[01:13:29] you know by the trailer this is eight
[01:13:30] trailers that's like a like [ __ ] 10
[01:13:33] years ago watch a fast and furious movie
[01:13:34] where there's a trailer and in the
[01:13:35] trailer they showed like a plane and
[01:13:36] then the movie looked like it was gonna
[01:13:38] end but I hadn't seen the plane yet so
[01:13:39] like okay there's no way it's ending and
[01:13:41] then surely enough it was a fake ending
[01:13:42] and then a [ __ ] playing game and then
[01:13:44] the whole thing was spoiled from a
[01:13:45] trailer okay I'll shut up
[01:13:47] [Music]
[01:13:57] hahaha
[01:13:59] well I really enjoyed chatting with you
[01:14:01] chatting

[01:14:05] in French it's chocolate but I don't
[01:14:06] think that's how you I like her she's
[01:14:08] talking to she's cool

[01:22:52] I mean I can't say for sure but who
[01:22:56] knows
[01:22:57] he's being a magician to money launder
[01:22:59] from his crime money
[01:23:01] makes why use your hands when a machine
[01:23:04] can do the work it would be a waste not
[01:23:06] to use
[01:23:11] a little complicated okay I'm not sure
[01:23:15] but basically everything we usually use
[01:23:18] here in the magnidium
[01:23:21] the type of energy that's produced from
[01:23:22] trials okay
[01:23:26] everyone does try the trials they do it
[01:23:28] on solar powered treadmills and it makes
[01:23:30] enter not so far but like the energy
[01:23:32] like the completely sure of all
[01:23:42] and converts it into energy to be used
[01:23:45] all around Fontaine
[01:23:47] so that's what its other function is
[01:23:55] get it
[01:23:57] unreliable like people's beliefs be
[01:23:59] turned into a stable power source for
[01:24:01] these missions the gods rely on belief
[01:24:04] to obtain power
[01:24:07] it's like Robin Hood no what is the the

[01:24:30] dark on but it is unstable speaking of
[01:24:32] Robin Hood do you know what else is
[01:24:34] taking from Rich and giving to the the
[01:24:35] less rich

[01:29:37] that was weird what does vision stop
[01:29:39] working
[01:29:41] oh so he's gonna use his delusion we get
[01:29:44] Electro child we're gonna get playable
[01:29:46] elect child too true
[01:29:49] I'm not sure
[01:29:51] that'd be sick I would pull control of
[01:29:53] my hydro Powers when I needed them and
[01:29:55] then he's gonna be why is this why are
[01:29:56] the people running like this
[01:29:59] he's gonna we're gonna elect your child
[01:30:01] and then he's gonna be the best for a as
[01:30:02] a driver for an overload shangling team
[01:30:04] it's gonna be called inter
[01:30:07] um what's okay wait it has to be a
[01:30:08] variation of international inter it
[01:30:10] doesn't matter anyway
[01:30:15] besides I always have my delusion in
[01:30:18] case I need it
[01:30:25] well I guess it's because I've been in a
[01:30:27] bad mood lately
[01:30:30] and the reason is that
[01:30:32] I don't know but recently
[01:30:35] there seems to be some sort of restless
[01:30:37] power stirring inside of me delusional
[01:30:39] okay yeah that's actually the team name
[01:30:41] but every now and then I feel like I'm
[01:30:42] in a terrible mood
[01:30:45] maybe you losing control of your vision
[01:30:48] just now is connected with that power
[01:30:50] you're feeling inside
[01:30:52] hmm that is a possibility so about this
[01:30:55] power I can't remember if I ever
[01:30:56] mentioned it before but when I was four
[01:30:58] Bro you've I have heard this story a
[01:31:01] hundred times
[01:31:03] I went to the abyss as a child I had to
[01:31:05] fight sorry it was during that time I
[01:31:07] learned nearly all of my abilities
[01:31:09] the one who took me under her wing and
[01:31:11] taught me was named skirk dude I
[01:31:14] literally asked the Jeff like a few days
[01:31:15] ago whose skirt was because we were
[01:31:17] playing scribble we're playing scribble
[01:31:20] against in character Edition and he was
[01:31:21] like oh do you not read the Laura that
[01:31:23] he told me something okay she was always
[01:31:25] quiet and very mysterious nobody knew
[01:31:28] where she came from or what she had been
[01:31:30] no no and she was always very strict
[01:31:32] when teaching me combat techniques one
[01:31:35] time I asked her why she was willing to
[01:31:37] take me on as an apprentice
[01:31:39] from what I could make of her answer it
[01:31:41] was
[01:31:42] because I had awakened it and traces of
[01:31:47] it remained on me
[01:31:49] she saw all my combat training useful in
[01:31:52] the future
[01:31:53] what what is
[01:31:55] what is it what she never explained that
[01:31:57] but my guess is a dream a dream I saw
[01:32:01] when I had just found that is suspicious
[01:32:03] in my dream I was in the deepest depths
[01:32:06] of the Sea and the boundless seabed was
[01:32:08] all around me
[01:32:09] but in front of me appeared a whale that
[01:32:12] was so massive
[01:32:13] I felt like I couldn't breathe
[01:32:15] a big whale
[01:32:19] when we fought against you before true
[01:32:22] [Music]
[01:32:23] hahaha
[01:32:24] that's just an abstract form of a whale
[01:32:26] that I create using my elemental powers
[01:32:28] it takes that shape because the scene I
[01:32:31] dreamed of the whale has always been
[01:32:32] stuck in my mind that's you I'm not a
[01:32:35] whale if anything I'm like a cute little
[01:32:36] seal or a dolphin
[01:32:38] true
[01:32:40] it's very possible that the power inside
[01:32:41] is connected to your power incident to
[01:32:43] your incident in the abyss
[01:32:45] can you make it sound so easy
[01:32:48] ever since the incident I experienced
[01:32:50] there I've never stopped searching for
[01:32:52] master skirk and that unknown Abyss but
[01:32:55] it's been years now and I've still found
[01:32:57] nothing will come out and we'll get more
[01:33:00] a bit she'll be the last boss in the
[01:33:01] abyss when we get floor 15. true we'll
[01:33:04] get 420 actually a new Abyss wave
[01:33:07] in patch 7.0 yeah I'm out of leads at
[01:33:11] this point but there's nothing more I
[01:33:13] can do
[01:33:14] it seems that strange Encounters in this
[01:33:16] world tend to be elusive like that oh
[01:33:19] seems the time really flies when I'm
[01:33:21] talking with you
[01:33:22] I just remembered I have somewhere else
[01:33:24] I need to be
[01:33:26] score of the Northland Bank no old
[01:33:28] friends to catch up on it's more true
[01:33:30] true I called it lately I've been
[01:33:33] sparring with some of fontaine's
[01:33:34] official Champion doulas whenever I'm
[01:33:36] feeling bored
[01:33:37] special Champion
[01:33:41] yep in Fontaine before a criminal goes
[01:33:44] to court they're given one chance wait
[01:33:46] that's [ __ ] sick by requesting a duel
[01:33:48] in the [ __ ] request trial by combat
[01:33:51] the champion Duelists are all powerful
[01:33:53] Fighters selected from among the Nations
[01:33:57] No Holds Barred fight with no specified
[01:34:00] stopping point
[01:34:01] so engaging in such a duel is regarded
[01:34:04] as a symbol of Defending Your honor if a
[01:34:06] criminal manages to win the duel they'll
[01:34:09] be acquitted but if they lose they'll
[01:34:11] have no choice but to stand trial
[01:34:13] and the worst case scenario is that
[01:34:16] you're simply killed in the duel
[01:34:18] though it's rumored that Fontaine has a
[01:34:20] death penalty
[01:34:21] so really oh let me just give that I
[01:34:23] wanted to close up to duel are those who
[01:34:24] have suffered a grave Injustice in being
[01:34:26] accused or those who greatly value their
[01:34:29] honor otherwise why gamble with your
[01:34:32] life wait if Fontan if you can just wait
[01:34:34] if you can just duel your way okay okay
[01:34:37] first of all this proves that Farina
[01:34:39] just cares about content second of all
[01:34:40] if you can duly read anything why don't
[01:34:42] you just [ __ ] dude just become buff
[01:34:44] just like and then commit crime and then
[01:34:47] you just can fight your way out of it
[01:34:51] apparently it's exceedingly rare for
[01:34:53] anyone to actually win never mind
[01:34:55] Fontaine probably an actor are you gonna
[01:34:57] win against
[01:34:58] the honor of its citizens
[01:35:02] none of the champion Duelists are to be
[01:35:04] trifled with which is exactly why I was
[01:35:07] itching to face them as soon as I got to
[01:35:09] Fontaine apparently the one I'm meeting
[01:35:12] today clarend is the strongest of the
[01:35:14] champion duelist how does child know
[01:35:16] Clarence asking her for some time
[01:35:18] against me today
[01:35:21] well
[01:35:25] back we heard that name somewhere before
[01:35:28] and oh before I forget
[01:35:31] I want you to have this oh
[01:35:35] what the huh your vision you're
[01:35:40] seriously just giving it away I'm just
[01:35:43] worried that it could become
[01:35:44] uncontrollable again
[01:35:45] I'd be pretty upset if it got in the way
[01:35:47] of my duel so I think I'll be better off
[01:35:50] with that dude let us pull for Electro
[01:35:52] Childs I just need you to hold on to it
[01:35:54] for a short while I'll come retrieve it
[01:35:56] when I have some time later
[01:36:02] contact Ed again don't you
[01:36:05] whatever gave you that idea I'll be in
[01:36:08] touch later
[01:36:14] sneaky guy
[01:36:18] well since we don't huh
[01:36:27] I could have seen that coming the
[01:36:30] reporter who was barely around for most
[01:36:32] of the story was the murderer all along
[01:36:34] imagine imagine you swallowed the child
[01:36:36] now after doing this Quest and you just
[01:36:38] can't use this abilities you just can't
[01:36:40] use your skill your burst
[01:36:51] have their merits but my mind thinks
[01:36:54] this style of novels are more
[01:36:56] well novel
[01:37:04] you should write a copy and read it too
[01:37:08] you know maybe I will pymon I'm good
[01:37:13] yeah let's go
[01:37:16] [Music]
[01:37:21] wait if you're doing this question
[01:37:22] you're not in this place you have to
[01:37:23] [ __ ] Aqua bus all the way there um
[01:37:28] in order took people 10 years
[01:37:31] I'm already here
[01:37:39] now this is fancy that's pretty cool I
[01:37:43] will admit I will admit I will admit I
[01:37:45] will admit
[01:37:48] you can swim there dude stop swimming
[01:37:51] everywhere there's a lot of people
[01:37:52] standing they're the same people that
[01:37:54] swim to Inazuma stop it
[01:37:57] please bless us and healthy child we
[01:38:01] pray
[01:38:03] I don't know why you always feel the
[01:38:04] need to ask so much I'll be happy as
[01:38:07] long as our child is healthy and lives a
[01:38:09] peaceful life
[01:38:10] I guess in font then it makes sense yes
[01:38:12] there are kid and there's no doubt
[01:38:14] they'll turn out shut the [ __ ] up should
[01:38:16] you
[01:38:19] maybe this is one of the customs and
[01:38:21] Fontaine
[01:38:23] vashi
[01:38:25] wait whoa whoa
[01:38:28] what
[01:38:31] she
[01:38:33] [Music]
[01:38:37] no mama didn't say anything
[01:38:40] are you hearing welcome to the Fountain
[01:38:42] of Lucine the [ __ ] is Russia Fontaine
[01:38:45] converges here
[01:38:47] it's customary for newlyweds to come
[01:38:54] Lenny asked me to wait here for you
[01:38:56] remember
[01:38:57] [Music]
[01:39:00] by the way Lynette I hear I seem to hear
[01:39:02] a faint voice what do you mean there are
[01:39:05] a lot of people here right now no no it
[01:39:06] was coming from it was coming from the
[01:39:07] fountain
[01:39:09] no no it was there's a voice coming from
[01:39:11] the
[01:39:13] I might be able to tell you something
[01:39:16] okay please tell me
[01:39:19] you might not be imagining things at all
[01:39:21] I suspect
[01:39:27] family have had similar experiences
[01:39:30] it's because of her sensitivity to the
[01:39:32] hydroelement
[01:39:34] does have to do with elemental power
[01:39:36] when do you cry pymon
[01:39:40] the [ __ ] with it
[01:39:43] just answer me when do you cry
[01:39:50] all the time when Pine months really sad
[01:39:55] yeah all the time and you should
[01:39:57] understand that tears
[01:40:06] flowing water in Fontaine converges
[01:40:08] even the tears that fall to the ground
[01:40:10] will eventually gather here
[01:40:12] so maybe what you heard was the intense
[01:40:14] emotion coming what someone's tears
[01:40:19] so what did the voice say
[01:40:21] it says vashi
[01:40:29] rather than worrying about them we
[01:40:31] should worry about my brother first
[01:40:32] don't let that calm look of his fool you
[01:40:35] he tends to get pretty nervous just
[01:40:37] before performance
[01:40:38] so chatting with Lenny might help him
[01:40:40] relax a little before okay we'll talk to
[01:40:42] Lydia right
[01:40:53] where are we going

[01:41:35] is it better or should I do a bit lower

[01:52:34] you're a law student latin's [ __ ]
[01:52:35] Antiquated dude even in law it sounds
[01:52:37] unless it's like a legal term where you
[01:52:39] have to say it it sounds like [ __ ] uh
[01:52:42] what is the word it sounds condescending
[01:52:43] to like because you're dude you're
[01:52:45] representing normal people when you're a
[01:52:46] lawyer you're not gonna be like just
[01:52:48] saying Latin words and no one
[01:52:49] understands except the lawyers were
[01:52:50] stroking their own [ __ ] [ __ ] in
[01:52:52] front of each other being like Oh I know
[01:52:53] so much Latin oh quid pro quo
[01:52:57] no offense taken being chief justice is
[01:53:00] merely what I do for my work nearly
[01:53:02] every person has their usual reserved
[01:53:04] seat so I'm not so special really
[01:53:07] and by the way I should probably let you
[01:53:10] know even though I would prefer not to
[01:53:14] there's someone sitting up there in the
[01:53:16] eyes agree of course it's foreign
[01:53:34] it's fine I don't need it
[01:53:37] oh my God what is she doing
[01:53:39] read I'm sorry I got distracted I'm
[01:53:40] sorry I'll listen
[01:53:44] [Music]
[01:53:46] she sure has a smug and satisfied look
[01:53:49] on her face because she has no idea that
[01:53:51] you saw right through her act very good
[01:53:53] that is for the best did he such a Chad
[01:53:56] look at him more attention look at his
[01:53:58] eyes enjoy the show
[01:54:02] huh
[01:54:03] so is this what things are like between
[01:54:05] the Chief Justice and the hydraulicon
[01:54:08] all right please wait just a moment
[01:54:10] longer I've pretty much finished my
[01:54:12] preparations and the performance will
[01:54:14] start as soon as the audience has made
[01:54:16] their way to their seats
[01:54:20] I'm focused
[01:54:22] shut up I'm on let's watch the show
[01:54:27] pawn shop
[01:54:30] you mean the lights the show must be
[01:54:32] starting
[01:54:33] hmm
[01:54:37] sorry bye mom will try to stay quiet did
[01:54:40] Imagine launching a movie with pymon
[01:54:42] [ __ ] I would [ __ ] welcome one and all
[01:54:45] to the Opera epicles I am the star of
[01:54:48] today's show yay Lenny

[01:54:53] who will be working as my wonderful
[01:54:55] assistant I love you warm welcome
[01:55:02] hello everyone
[01:55:04] [Applause]
[01:55:06] I know she may seem to be a little
[01:55:07] sleepy right now but that's just a sign
[01:55:09] that she's nervous whatever
[01:55:14] now some of you may be thinking two
[01:55:17] Vision holders who can freely manipulate
[01:55:19] elemental powers performing magic is not
[01:55:22] true magic at all so we will let go of
[01:55:23] our Visions I would like to take a
[01:55:25] moment to assure you that elemental
[01:55:27] powers will have nothing to do with what
[01:55:29] you will win 5 out of 10 start so far
[01:55:31] you could have put your Visions in like
[01:55:32] a bag or something to make it seem more
[01:55:34] believable more like performative all
[01:55:36] good oh never mind never 10 out of 10.
[01:55:40] 10 out of 10. hey he gave them to
[01:55:42] someone that's even better even better
[01:55:43] 10 out of 10.
[01:55:45] okay
[01:55:48] all right well Walsh no he's a better
[01:55:50] showman than me I'm sorry so begin
[01:55:52] Lynette will now exit the stage to make
[01:55:54] some preparations
[01:55:56] I know you might miss her but don't
[01:55:58] worry she'll be coming right back on
[01:56:00] stage
[01:56:02] perhaps in an unexpected way I'm sure it
[01:56:06] is Showtime soon enough
[01:56:08] okay and before I forget there's one
[01:56:11] more thing I should say we have a
[01:56:13] special guest what can happen in the
[01:56:15] blink of an eye
[01:56:17] that sounds like spoilers like like that
[01:56:19] sounds like we're gonna hear that and
[01:56:20] then the question's greatest
[01:56:22] is making things disappear or appear the
[01:56:26] possibilities are endless
[01:56:33] [Music]
[01:56:36] boom cat
[01:56:37] [Music]
[01:56:45] sorry
[01:56:49] [Music]

[01:56:59] top hat but this isn't what you came for
[01:57:01] my card is pop out these little tricks
[01:57:04] you've seen them all before
[01:57:07] so it's time for something truly
[01:57:09] extraordinary don't you think

[01:57:22] oh Houdini it was literally Houdini this
[01:57:24] water tank I shall make my sister vanish
[01:57:27] completely right before your very eyes
[01:57:41] Prestige reference the procedure is such
[01:57:43] a good movie
[01:57:45] it's actually quite simple
[01:57:47] she'll just turn into air bubbles and
[01:57:49] Float right out of the top
[01:57:56] oh oh oh no
[01:58:00] I told them to check all the props
[01:58:02] carefully no he's debating us he's
[01:58:03] debating us this is planned even air
[01:58:06] can't escape an amateur magician would
[01:58:09] be getting very nervous right around now

[01:59:26] still that so true enough yet oh
[01:59:28] actually I can't see through your
[01:59:30] clothing on stage rather than getting
[01:59:32] caught up and trying to see that which
[01:59:34] has been intentionally true [ __ ] the

[01:59:54] begun I've prepared even more
[01:59:57] astonishing surprises for everyone here
[01:59:59] okay the magic of transformation and
[02:00:02] disappearance can go far beyond what
[02:00:04] you've just seen
[02:00:08] I'm sure many of you are thinking that
[02:00:11] escaping the water tank was impressed
[02:00:12] I'm focusing but Lynette is still my
[02:00:16] assistant after all
[02:00:18] in which case I have ample time to make
[02:00:21] all necessary preparations what if let
[02:00:23] me just shoot someone and then we think
[02:00:24] it's magic so he gets away with it I

[02:07:36] the guards okay
[02:07:40] unfortunately the person who is in the
[02:07:42] magic box has been pronounced dead his
[02:07:44] name was Cowell
[02:07:48] apparently the fireworks on stage
[02:07:50] ignited the ropes that were suspending
[02:07:52] the water tanks then caused the tank to
[02:07:54] fall onto the stage what did Kyle do man
[02:07:57] we are still not sure let me killed
[02:07:58] Cowell in the Box rather than the guest
[02:08:01] from the audience
[02:08:02] and after an initial search of the area
[02:08:04] the guards have confirmed that the girl
[02:08:06] is nowhere to be found minus two appears
[02:08:09] that this incident was not merely some
[02:08:11] mishap with the performance
[02:08:14] and there are many indications that it
[02:08:16] is connected with the case of the serial
[02:08:18] disappearances oh it's almost as if I
[02:08:21] could tell
[02:08:22] the serial disappearances case
[02:08:27] I mentioned before
[02:08:30] I know I know the truth okay she threw
[02:08:36] the whole thing really using such a
[02:08:39] shallow and obvious mystery as his
[02:08:42] finale
[02:08:43] he really underestimate us that she
[02:08:45] figured out good job
[02:08:49] Magister Lenny is now the prime suspect
[02:08:52] for the serial disappearance wait is
[02:08:54] sauce short for suspect oh no it's
[02:08:56] probably suspicious nevermind
[02:08:58] me
[02:08:59] nothing was an accident
[02:09:02] oh this all occurred during your magic
[02:09:06] show did it not the missing girl
[02:09:09] disappeared after being chosen did she
[02:09:12] not true
[02:09:17] three for three Farina think about it
[02:09:20] it's about magicians making things
[02:09:26] deception a bald face challenge sure
[02:09:29] four for four I guess
[02:09:39] for the show he told us they would like
[02:09:41] to catch the criminal box save
[02:09:42] discussion for a later time please
[02:09:45] lady Farina may I assume that your
[02:09:48] comments just now constitute an
[02:09:50] accusation against Mr Linney and his
[02:09:51] associates and that you are pressing
[02:09:53] charges
[02:09:57] oh she's just being goofy
[02:09:59] [Music]
[02:10:02] I guess what
[02:10:05] so stupid dude
[02:10:09] makes looks like she's gonna personally
[02:10:11] deliver Justice she's just goofing
[02:10:13] around she's just being goofy murder
[02:10:14] carried out under the cover of a magic
[02:10:16] show
[02:10:17] Farina said it all
[02:10:21] I mean of course the my dear people but
[02:10:26] what excites me even more than the
[02:10:29] obvious truth before our eyes is the
[02:10:32] opponent I'll be The Gaslight archon
[02:10:40] [Music]
[02:10:45] as a child I was taught to pick my
[02:10:47] battles
[02:10:49] if there's something happening over
[02:10:51] there it's not my problem don't [ __ ]
[02:10:53] put me in this I don't know Lily like
[02:10:55] that we met like an hour ago
[02:11:00] then there's no problem at all
[02:11:03] you know the traveler and I already had
[02:11:05] a duel the first time we met
[02:11:09] and I won but with Lenny's help our
[02:11:12] little duel ended in a draw
[02:11:16] but draws really are the most boring
[02:11:20] possible true
[02:11:22] no more draws between the two of us
[02:11:25] there must be a clear winner and a loser
[02:11:29] and with better place to hold such a
[02:11:32] riveting Showdown and decide the true
[02:11:34] Victor than here on the ground bro we
[02:11:37] literally fought Ryden why are you
[02:11:40] trying to fight us
[02:11:46] I I understand
[02:11:48] charges have now been pressed we killed
[02:11:50] [ __ ] scarra's Mech with a dull blade
[02:11:54] well traveler seems lady Farina has set
[02:11:56] you in her sights
[02:11:58] but putting her dramatic rhetoric aside
[02:12:00] for a moment

[02:12:25] the opera house that goal both sides May

[02:12:29] cases and search for the truth wait this

[02:12:44] guards

[02:12:49] of case this big shot Outlander can
[02:12:51] build why you call me a big shot I
[02:12:54] didn't say anything new involvement I
[02:12:56] was just watching the show eating my
[02:12:58] popcorn and now I'm in the middle of
[02:13:00] this stuck in the middle I everyone is
[02:13:03] uh dismissed and the audience begins to
[02:13:04] leave along with Arena and navient okay
[02:13:11] okay I I'll if if I'm living here I'm
[02:13:13] like Lenny what the [ __ ] is wrong with
[02:13:15] you why am I in the middle of this were
[02:13:18] you frightened what do you mean were you
[02:13:19] for you killed two people
[02:13:21] scared after witnessing an accident like
[02:13:23] that yeah I'm a little shaken up myself
[02:13:28] how could this happen
[02:13:29] no he didn't well someone did
[02:13:32] I know you already claimed that you
[02:13:33] would defend me but now it's just us
[02:13:35] talking
[02:13:37] tell me
[02:13:38] do you think I could possibly be the
[02:13:40] murderer okay
[02:13:42] in all honesty you probably even killed
[02:13:45] but I know you're connected to our
[02:13:47] lakino because I watched the trailer
[02:13:49] and you have the [ __ ] little
[02:13:50] psychopath hisoka teardrop on your
[02:13:53] [ __ ] face so I don't know if I can
[02:13:54] trust you no disrespect I like you but
[02:13:57] I'm just saying be honest with me what
[02:13:59] happened over there just talk to me and
[02:14:01] we can figure this out together
[02:14:03] thank you so much for trusting me
[02:14:07] I'm sure everyone sees me as the biggest
[02:14:09] suspect at this point
[02:14:11] but if you ask me the whole thing is
[02:14:13] Mysteries layered upon Mysteries such
[02:14:16] that all that's left
[02:14:18] confusion I don't know whether what
[02:14:20] happened there on the stage was purely
[02:14:22] an accident or not
[02:14:24] I don't know why poor Cal was in the Box
[02:14:26] they who [ __ ] with cowl in the Box call
[02:14:28] that girl chosen from the audience could
[02:14:29] suddenly disappear
[02:14:31] someone joined the girl kidnapped
[02:14:34] because they're like doing a kidnapping
[02:14:35] thing I don't know why but whoever it is
[02:14:37] probably a [ __ ] fatou are like you
[02:14:38] know who knows kidnapped her and then
[02:14:40] [ __ ] trucked Cowell in there poor
[02:14:42] Cowell one minute

[02:14:49] the [ __ ] Inazuma mask aware now this
[02:14:51] is the [ __ ] we saw another dude the mask
[02:14:53] I was gonna compare him to her but I
[02:14:54] forgot her name so I didn't and then he
[02:14:56] died too
[02:14:58] wait ciao oh no
[02:15:00] oh no
[02:15:05] there's a mask though this is the mask
[02:15:09] [Music]
[02:15:10] as this book says
[02:15:12] the impossible could not have happened
[02:15:15] whatever happened must have been that
[02:15:17] which is possible
[02:15:19] what the [ __ ]
[02:15:23] them when we were reading at the
[02:15:25] Bookshop in the city earlier pretty cool
[02:15:28] huh
[02:15:29] don't worry
[02:15:31] okay
[02:15:33] she actually looks better now
[02:15:36] true Lynette
[02:15:45] bro we need to get back okay no way okay
[02:15:48] okay I get it like oh that's not grieve
[02:15:51] you know there's no point in just being
[02:15:52] sad all the time I get it but your
[02:15:54] assistant died like
[02:15:57] two minutes ago you can this does not
[02:16:00] feel sincere it's been like two minutes
[02:16:02] so with the guards watching our every
[02:16:04] move it's going literally you didn't
[02:16:05] have time to prove our own innocence
[02:16:09] good thing you agreed to be our
[02:16:10] attorneys this feels like man that sucks
[02:16:12] thanks for that anyways no time to be
[02:16:14] sad
[02:16:15] yes thank you so much
[02:16:17] I'm Gonna Let You Down on the net
[02:16:21] oh uh since we're going to start
[02:16:24] investigating has a question first what
[02:16:27] go during the performance
[02:16:30] oh well I'm afraid that would involve
[02:16:33] some of our essential Trade Secrets as
[02:16:35] magicians bro I'm your lawyer just tell
[02:16:37] me we literally have a legally binding
[02:16:39] contract I can't tell anyone I suppose
[02:16:42] just [ __ ] tell me oh he's gonna tell
[02:16:43] us the truth behind our tricks is going
[02:16:45] to be important evidence that will be
[02:16:47] weighted during the trial true
[02:16:51] as a magician our magic shows a work of
[02:16:54] art we've poured countless hours and
[02:16:56] spared no effort in perfecting it but if
[02:16:59] revealing our secrets will help you
[02:17:01] uncover the truth behind what happened
[02:17:02] then it will be well worth it
[02:17:05] we should go somewhere else if we're
[02:17:07] going to do yeah I thought this was like
[02:17:08] a a lighting thing in game but I've
[02:17:12] noticed that because my monitors are
[02:17:13] like violent color settings it makes all
[02:17:15] my characters look like they have red
[02:17:16] skin and cutscenes which is really weird
[02:17:17] like it looks like they're like all
[02:17:18] sunburned
[02:17:23] it looks normal what no
[02:17:29] [Music]
[02:17:34] uh I see you must be the traveler that
[02:17:37] lady foreign
[02:17:39] come with me and you'll see
[02:17:42] the deceased is one of Lenny's I guess I
[02:17:45] should listen Allison
[02:17:46] even though he hadn't joined the troop
[02:17:48] long he was hard working can I unique
[02:17:50] chat because it's kind of diesel cringe
[02:17:51] yeah you can I trust you mods do
[02:17:53] whatever you got to do setting up and
[02:17:54] inspecting the props as well as
[02:17:55] assisting with the show and keeping the
[02:17:57] crowd engaged
[02:17:58] as you probably saw when you were in the
[02:18:02] audience the water tank suddenly fell
[02:18:05] and smashed the Box wait a second howl
[02:18:07] inside it just
[02:18:09] uh regulations and etiquette
[02:18:12] um to my client Lenny why don't you just
[02:18:15] put the water box because you're not
[02:18:16] gonna use it anymore why don't you just
[02:18:17] put the water box like over there and
[02:18:19] then the magic box here so then even if
[02:18:21] it falls it doesn't why are you putting
[02:18:24] it under the like
[02:18:27] is there a reason why it's above like
[02:18:31] all good this is the real mystery what
[02:18:34] the [ __ ] the scene and we're unable to
[02:18:36] find any traces of the girl what was
[02:18:38] that however if you look carefully the
[02:18:39] box was positioned directly under the
[02:18:41] water tank the ropes holding the tank
[02:18:43] were then burned by the pyrotechnics on
[02:18:45] stage causing them to snap all these
[02:18:48] factors lining up so perfectly makes it
[02:18:50] hard to see this as a mere accident if
[02:18:53] anything the more logical explanation is
[02:18:55] that the whole incident was
[02:18:56] intentionally planned intentionally
[02:18:57] planned just like a person to have
[02:18:59] access to all these areas
[02:19:01] if he doesn't have a move
[02:19:04] unless are you both good friends of his
[02:19:07] we've just met him
[02:19:11] so in just a short time he was not only
[02:19:14] able to win your trust but you know this
[02:19:16] guy's making a lot of good points right
[02:19:17] now attorneys I know there's no such
[02:19:19] thing as magic the real trick of a
[02:19:22] magician is holding the audience in the
[02:19:24] palm of their hand
[02:19:26] you know this guy's doing some good
[02:19:28] points a lot of cases
[02:19:29] and I can tell you that people are the
[02:19:32] least reliable kind of evidence
[02:19:35] sorry I tend to be pretty
[02:19:37] straightforward anyway you may
[02:19:38] investigate the scene of the crime
[02:19:40] yourselves if you're curious who knows
[02:19:42] maybe you'll be able to come up with
[02:19:44] some new this guy looks like commemos
[02:19:46] wait does he wait let me look at him
[02:19:48] case record okay
[02:19:50] perception skill okay
[02:19:55] I should probably read these uh this is
[02:19:57] one of Lenny's assistants named Cowell
[02:19:59] because it doesn't matter
[02:20:05] wait where was he I want to look at him
[02:20:10] wait does he actually look like kameos
[02:20:12] let me look at him
[02:20:15] in the end we're both after the truth
[02:20:19] he does it he doesn't chill he doesn't
[02:20:21] do it
[02:20:21] [Laughter]
[02:20:24] examine the magic box the broken Magic
[02:20:26] Box wait we need some detective music
[02:20:28] one sec chat
[02:20:41] all right
[02:20:42] the broken Magic to the guards completed
[02:20:45] their investigation
[02:20:48] it's loud not as fun
[02:20:50] okay uh let me press Eve
[02:20:53] oh
[02:20:55] see them in the white lines
[02:20:57] this is where the magic box was struck
[02:20:59] if Cowell wasn't inside the box he might
[02:21:02] have dodged it
[02:21:09] what's up Quentin
[02:21:11] isn't that Tarantino's name
[02:21:13] investigation
[02:21:15] turns out there's an issue with the
[02:21:17] random number selector after all
[02:21:20] see told you what is the machine
[02:21:33] number selector
[02:21:36] you're trying to help them
[02:21:39] it's a little loud it's louder than the
[02:21:41] [ __ ] game I'm sorry let me use the
[02:21:44] machine to pick a random member of the
[02:21:45] audience during his performance right
[02:21:48] lucky girl that later disappeared well
[02:21:51] we thought there might be a serious
[02:21:53] problem with the machine so we had it
[02:21:54] taken away for further inspection
[02:21:56] it turns out the seat numbered pick
[02:21:58] wasn't random at all the machine picks
[02:22:01] that same number every time
[02:22:04] I know that you have to make a
[02:22:06] reservation in advance to get a seat
[02:22:08] regardless of whether it's a trial or
[02:22:10] some performance in other words Lenny
[02:22:13] knew who would be sitting where from the
[02:22:15] very beginning you know that is pretty
[02:22:16] damning evidence but what if Lenny just
[02:22:18] didn't know oh never mind
[02:22:25] so he knew where everyone would be is
[02:22:28] what you're saying
[02:22:31] hmm
[02:22:34] it was someone tampered with it
[02:22:37] okay
[02:22:39] okay you know that is a pretty that is
[02:22:41] some pretty damning evidence
[02:22:44] let me look uh over here
[02:22:50] meow right now
[02:22:53] 100 gifted
[02:22:57] so quickly by fireworks
[02:23:02] [Music]
[02:23:05] hmm
[02:23:07] interesting
[02:23:12] is made from different materials most of
[02:23:15] it was burned away but there's still a
[02:23:17] little bit of it left
[02:23:18] it seems to be flammable
[02:23:23] [Music]
[02:23:31] yeah just check the Monokuma file true
[02:23:33] it'll tell us how he died material
[02:23:40] also not all of the road just where it's
[02:23:42] not well maybe I'll throw but it says
[02:23:43] the location
[02:23:47] hmm that is interesting okay let's talk
[02:23:50] to this guy
[02:23:51] what up mojis
[02:23:56] I'm gonna pause the music
[02:23:59] oh this location has also been cordoned
[02:24:02] off because the magic troop members are
[02:24:03] currently considered Prime suspects
[02:24:06] the investigation team is still
[02:24:08] collecting evidence okay seats were all
[02:24:10] booked in advance so we were able to
[02:24:12] deduce them can you tell us who the
[02:24:13] woman is sure it's not like this is
[02:24:15] confidential her name is Halsey Halsey
[02:24:18] painter from Fontaine who's made a bit
[02:24:19] of a name first okay
[02:24:22] apparently she wasn't a regular at the
[02:24:24] opera house but she'd been feeling some
[02:24:26] pressure with her work lately which made
[02:24:27] her decide to come see them magic troop
[02:24:29] members all claim not to Nowhere we have
[02:24:31] looked into her social connections it
[02:24:34] seems that she has no personal
[02:24:35] grievances or conflicts of interest with
[02:24:37] the suspects that simply put she wasn't
[02:24:39] related to the magic troupe at all which
[02:24:41] matches the features of the previous
[02:24:43] serial disappearances
[02:24:45] were the victims of previous cases also
[02:24:47] chosen at random that's how it seems to
[02:24:50] us in any case apart from the fact that
[02:24:52] they were all young women
[02:24:54] y'all remember we're on the same age
[02:24:56] range if you do happen to see the
[02:24:58] missing girl please be sure to contact
[02:25:00] us
[02:25:01] it is of utmost importance that we get
[02:25:03] to the bottom of these disappearances
[02:25:07] how's this looks comparison she's a
[02:25:08] famous painter and she came to watch the
[02:25:09] show in order to take a break from her
[02:25:10] work
[02:25:13] um
[02:25:17] okay well that is uh okay that's a clue
[02:25:26] what up essel door
[02:25:29] I see that you're investigating the area
[02:25:32] well it just so happens that I'm
[02:25:34] interested too it's kid no one cares
[02:25:36] yeah yeah you're not gonna help in the
[02:25:39] case five gifted says this guy does not
[02:25:41] actually help
[02:25:45] then why don't I tell you my hypothesis
[02:25:47] first
[02:25:54] exactly
[02:25:55] it wasn't terribly loud but I suspect
[02:25:58] that most people heard it tab there was
[02:26:00] a thought one was awaiting the results
[02:26:01] of Lenny's trick with baited breath
[02:26:04] so no one paid it much mind I paid much
[02:26:06] mind
[02:26:07] that makes sense I'm of the opinion that
[02:26:10] it may have been the sound of Lenny's
[02:26:12] accomplice Lynette perhaps jumping atop
[02:26:15] the water tank or something like that
[02:26:17] and when the pirate Technics went off
[02:26:19] she cut the rope sending the water tank
[02:26:22] Crashing Down
[02:26:23] wait wasn't the noise we heard too loud
[02:26:26] for that
[02:26:27] perhaps the balance wasn't right leading
[02:26:30] to a particularly rough Landing
[02:26:33] yeah when I jump on something it does a
[02:26:36] true no that's true
[02:26:39] [ __ ] idiot bro
[02:26:41] that does remind him on though the only
[02:26:44] thing this guy said was yeah remember
[02:26:45] the bang sound
[02:26:48] I mean true but his whole guess was dog
[02:26:50] [ __ ] if I had abilities I would use them
[02:26:52] on them what's what weapon I think wait
[02:26:54] is it a key my weapon or does uh what
[02:26:57] should we equip her with dull blade is
[02:26:59] too low accurate it's like funny
[02:27:01] there you go
[02:27:04] fog
[02:27:08] magic box
[02:27:12] looks like I ordered a box but Lenny
[02:27:13] move basically from the stage how did he
[02:27:15] do it
[02:27:16] what if there's a trap door
[02:27:19] no but it was like two seconds he
[02:27:20] wouldn't have time
[02:27:23] what if there's two Lenny's he has a
[02:27:25] twin brother The Prestige sorry if I
[02:27:28] spoiled a 20 year old movie for you guys

[02:27:44] should hey Molly money's still talking
[02:27:46] to the guards
[02:27:47] it seems he'll have a lot of explaining
[02:27:49] to do I think someone will be assigned
[02:27:51] to monitor us later but that's all right
[02:27:55] I was gonna watch that there's a lot
[02:27:56] more to it don't worry it's still worth

[02:30:06] now back to the situation at hand that's
[02:30:09] right I've always kept an eye on the
[02:30:12] serial disappearance cases my interest
[02:30:14] stems from a matter back from my
[02:30:15] father's time
[02:30:16] judging from the look of things
[02:30:19] I find Lenny an unlikely Mastermind why
[02:30:22] does everyone like silver
[02:30:35] was quick to point the finger at Lenny
[02:30:37] without any decisive evidence whatsoever
[02:30:39] yeah she's just silly like that don't
[02:30:40] worry about her she's just pretty goofy
[02:30:44] that's not her
[02:30:45] the Justice had to interrupt her and ask
[02:30:47] if she was pressing charges just to keep
[02:30:49] her from getting carried away anyway a
[02:30:52] trial Begins the moment someone levels
[02:30:54] charges and of course there was no way
[02:30:57] Farina was going to back down in that
[02:30:59] situation
[02:31:00] I like you just don't trust the hydro
[02:31:03] archon well what's your opinion I must
[02:31:07] admit that she can be interesting at
[02:31:09] times but liking her doesn't mean that
[02:31:11] she's just goofy with her all right I've
[02:31:14] answered your question now it's time you
[02:31:17] answer mine a minute
[02:31:20] well I say it does but don't worry you
[02:31:24] won't hear any pointless questions from
[02:31:26] me
[02:31:27] in your opinion do you think it's right
[02:31:29] to treat a trial like it's an opera
[02:31:32] um
[02:31:33] well so there is more gigas
[02:31:36] and my lift combined dude she's just a
[02:31:39] live streamer you know the people that
[02:31:40] like they'll have like a like you know
[02:31:43] the people that are like stream they're
[02:31:45] like relationship problems for views
[02:31:47] it's literally Farina she just does that
[02:31:49] for trials they're like oh there's drama
[02:31:51] in my life let me stream it and then
[02:31:52] they turn the live stream on and they're
[02:31:54] like wow my girlfriend I cheated on her
[02:31:57] and then they talk about it because
[02:31:58] they're [ __ ] weird and then that's
[02:31:59] like the whole thing and then they make
[02:32:00] videos on it that's Reno but I'm I like
[02:32:04] freedom
[02:32:05] she's just a live streamer
[02:32:09] most astute album
[02:32:11] who think that the traveler traveler
[02:32:13] spawns was most excellent no matter how
[02:32:16] wonderful the script or how fervent the
[02:32:18] audience's expectations may be the
[02:32:21] trials that go on stage here must be
[02:32:23] based in fact then if that can be done
[02:32:26] boss then
[02:32:28] all right that's quite enough
[02:32:31] anyway I like your answer you pass with
[02:32:35] flying colors no I feel like foreign
[02:32:43] [Music]
[02:32:46] oh well I can be the assistant sure or
[02:32:51] your companion if you like
[02:32:53] really nice [ __ ] oh never mind
[02:32:57] the fire be it for me to brag but I
[02:33:00] believe that the Marcel's intuition will
[02:33:02] be instrumental and uncut you wish to
[02:33:04] save a friend from false accusations and
[02:33:07] we wish to unravel the disappearances
[02:33:11] you have a point
[02:33:15] [Music]
[02:33:17] yeah what's up silver
[02:33:19] okay the shades are growing on me
[02:33:22] I have nothing to add okay
[02:33:25] thanks man
[02:33:28] we'll be making some preparations first
[02:33:34] Lenny's tricks she does the same hair as
[02:33:36] bronia
[02:33:40] okay
[02:33:42] so now he's just [ __ ] chilling here
[02:33:43] that's pretty cool I like her hot
[02:33:45] I actually cried a lot
[02:33:51] I feel like Farina
[02:33:53] so far very interesting character
[02:33:56] which makes her make me likes her oh
[02:33:58] it's me [ __ ] which means you like her as
[02:34:00] a character but I feel like if she was
[02:34:01] like real she'd be annoying as [ __ ] does
[02:34:03] that make sense like if that was really
[02:34:04] how courts were decided I'd be like dude
[02:34:06] what the [ __ ] is this garbage but
[02:34:08] because it's a game okay that's pretty
[02:34:09] funny you must register your identity
[02:34:12] with us so like I like your intention
[02:34:13] but if she was like real I'd be like oh
[02:34:15] this is kinda I don't know how I feel
[02:34:17] about her
[02:34:23] Excel again
[02:34:33] we have left from here at least not from
[02:34:36] that point on
[02:34:38] it's like I'll hide them you'd be able
[02:34:39] to send her IRL no I'll hide them like
[02:34:41] he's pretty like
[02:34:46] like he's kind of like socially doesn't
[02:34:48] give a [ __ ] but he's like I feel like
[02:34:50] he's like smart like I feel like he has
[02:34:51] like
[02:34:52] good qualities
[02:34:54] I'm not saying Freda doesn't I'm saying
[02:34:56] she like she would she would make her
[02:34:58] whole nation's court system dot like
[02:35:00] just like a theater show for fun because
[02:35:02] she's silly and goofy which I like as a
[02:35:05] gentian player I'm like this is cool but
[02:35:07] if that was like my real archon in real
[02:35:09] life and that's how my chords were I'd
[02:35:11] be like
[02:35:19] [Music]
[02:35:23] well because I was in charge of security
[02:35:26] near the entrance at that time
[02:35:29] I couldn't see Lenny's performance from
[02:35:31] here which was quite a shame just might
[02:35:33] but still I did not abandon my post and
[02:35:36] I stayed put no matter how loud the
[02:35:39] applause was if someone had so much as
[02:35:41] even approached the door I would have
[02:35:44] noticed it let alone if they had tried
[02:35:46] okay so no one could have left or
[02:35:48] entered
[02:35:49] is that what that means
[02:35:52] or maybe enter I don't know if she's
[02:35:53] talking about enter but don't could have
[02:35:54] left
[02:35:56] no one left well it didn't mention if
[02:35:59] someone entered but it says no one left
[02:36:00] okay
[02:36:04] let's go talk to Lenny
[02:36:06] wait is he no he's up lazy dolls no
[02:36:20] well we know how magic is made when
[02:36:22] Lynette oh she's like magic starto and
[02:36:24] then she Magics all over it attractions
[02:36:27] and making notes is necessary very good
[02:36:29] thanks for being like magic and then
[02:36:31] Magics I pull a rose out of my hat as a
[02:36:33] gift for you if I could
[02:36:35] fear May spare the pleasantries I'm just
[02:36:38] doing my job
[02:36:47] me I'm Spina de rosula's Guardian Angel
[02:36:50] if you've got a problem I've got the
[02:36:53] Firepower
[02:36:55] sorry I got a little carried away there
[02:36:58] call me Navia I'm a partner of theirs
[02:37:01] and we'll be helping investors yeah
[02:37:03] we're friends we're close like that I'm
[02:37:04] friends with her no big deal me and
[02:37:06] Navia are like we go way back it's no
[02:37:08] big deal
[02:37:11] I would be most grateful
[02:37:14] say we're tagging along it's not every
[02:37:17] day you get to see the secrets behind
[02:37:18] magic performed on such a large scale I
[02:37:22] like her eyes it's like a star okay I
[02:37:24] appreciate your kind interest dude her
[02:37:26] eyes okay I don't know if I'm brain
[02:37:28] rotted from Genji but Lynette's eyes
[02:37:30] literally look like the spiral Abyss
[02:37:31] like when you click on like the floor
[02:37:33] nine and it shows like the the purple
[02:37:34] circle it literally I can't stop seeing
[02:37:37] that
[02:37:50] look at that
[02:37:52] I'm not trying to be dramatic
[02:37:54] remembering the details of a trick will
[02:37:56] help you understand the methods used to
[02:37:57] perform it more easily
[02:38:00] huh
[02:38:02] balloons and other decorations here
[02:38:05] that is true where are the balloons ah
[02:38:08] good eye
[02:38:09] that said you're still far from
[02:38:11] discovering these back of the door's not
[02:38:14] the same
[02:38:18] very good indeed I thought you might not
[02:38:21] be able to catch that given that the
[02:38:23] back of this door was patterned well why
[02:38:25] is it like patterns are now gone because
[02:38:28] the flashback maybe
[02:38:29] so if you put two and two together what
[02:38:32] do you get there's another box inside of
[02:38:35] the Box exactly
[02:38:38] all right let's go
[02:38:41] four yes two and two together is four
[02:38:46] wait I literally called that there's a
[02:38:48] trap door under but that still doesn't
[02:38:49] explain
[02:38:52] how there therefore he has another twin
[02:38:54] brother true
[02:39:00] I literally called it but there's no way
[02:39:01] he does all this oh he's the Waypoint
[02:39:03] [ __ ] he has a portable Waypoint of
[02:39:06] course see this the box with the lucky
[02:39:09] audience member in it but the loading
[02:39:11] screen the other side how fast is his PC
[02:39:13] because what if he got stuck on the Geo
[02:39:15] symbol ensuring that the box is in the
[02:39:18] right direction
[02:39:22] it's the purpose of
[02:39:24] this I did another box nope precisely
[02:39:27] the inner box would descend after the
[02:39:29] audience member was put inside and be
[02:39:31] moved along the trolley all while the
[02:39:33] outer box would remain on stage as if
[02:39:36] nothing had ever changed
[02:39:39] once the box was lowered the trolley
[02:39:41] would store some energy through this
[02:39:43] device here with which it would complete
[02:39:45] the rest of the steps the audience
[02:39:48] member would only be able to feel some
[02:39:50] slight movements in the dark and by the
[02:39:52] time she walked out she would already be
[02:39:54] back on stage okay what about you
[02:40:00] yes a phonograph operated by Lynette was
[02:40:03] used to achieve that effect well you
[02:40:04] literally stepped out of the box though
[02:40:06] my assistant and I had already scripted
[02:40:09] our conversation beforehand when the
[02:40:11] countdown began I had already gone to
[02:40:13] the opposite box via a tunnel using that
[02:40:16] ladder and what about Lynette where was
[02:40:19] she
[02:40:21] I was in the mezzanine space in the back
[02:40:23] of the box
[02:40:25] oh that's how we were able to coordinate
[02:40:27] Lenny's lines with the assistant
[02:40:29] and by the way I love Layla I was the
[02:40:31] one who walked out of the box at the end
[02:40:34] I mean we are twins all it takes is a
[02:40:37] change of clothes and no one can tell
[02:40:38] who's who
[02:40:40] bro you have a mark
[02:40:42] all good
[02:40:44] also she has cat ears but I guess you
[02:40:46] could wear a hat over it true okay fair
[02:40:49] enough I guess
[02:40:53] and that's my favorite part of this
[02:40:55] trick only Lynette and I can perform it
[02:41:01] [Music]
[02:41:05] wait so they literally just
[02:41:08] amazing Lynette would briefly walk out
[02:41:09] of the box and then go back in jumping
[02:41:12] into the tunnel and escaping before the
[02:41:14] book okay whoever designed this Quest
[02:41:15] literally watched The Prestige I'm not
[02:41:17] even [ __ ] kidding go watch the movie
[02:41:19] and tell me and the trick I mean I like
[02:41:22] the movie so it's not like a bad thing
[02:41:23] but word here being wood
[02:41:25] but as you saw Cal was in the Box not
[02:41:28] our audience member she on the other
[02:41:31] hand mysteriously vanished we really
[02:41:34] don't know how that happened
[02:41:38] if not for that interlude this would
[02:41:40] have been an astonishing trick I
[02:41:43] probably never would have figured out
[02:41:44] how you pulled it off
[02:41:48] that someone was able to use this magic
[02:41:50] trick to commit a crime
[02:41:54] you have a look around I think we can
[02:41:55] come up with some more leads
[02:41:57] this is the scene of the crime so Lenny
[02:42:00] and Lynette are not permitted to stay
[02:42:01] here I'll escort them back up yes of
[02:42:04] course no need to be so strict now I
[02:42:07] won't disappear Into Thin Air you know
[02:42:09] suspicious anyone we're counting on you
[02:42:14] by using a box out of the box it is for
[02:42:16] the Box containing the audience member
[02:42:18] to be transported across via tunnel
[02:42:19] underneath and Lenny would use this on
[02:42:20] all the other side meal having her
[02:42:21] Ginger outfit Lynette and her sister
[02:42:23] would take charge of onstage
[02:42:24] interactions
[02:42:32] cool it sorry
[02:42:36] I still don't have my phone I mean I
[02:42:38] don't need it but
[02:42:45] uh uh let's examine the clothing
[02:42:58] he's wearing right her clothes are here
[02:43:03] to be found wait what
[02:43:07] right
[02:43:10] that if you're kidnapping them
[02:43:12] ugh this is so confusing Hannah doesn't
[02:43:16] want to be a detective anymore
[02:43:19] the [ __ ] they're just yelling their
[02:43:20] clothes
[02:43:25] sus
[02:43:33] sis
[02:43:35] it's roadhog from OverWatch he has the
[02:43:38] fisherman skin on Ice fisherman which
[02:43:40] you could buy during uh winter and then
[02:43:42] it could
[02:43:44] perhaps was a different trick
[02:43:48] but why would it have been left here
[02:43:51] whatever it is
[02:43:57] that could be my mom I think
[02:44:01] base
[02:44:03] the floor is wet please be careful not
[02:44:06] to slip
[02:44:07] speaking of which
[02:44:09] why would there be water
[02:44:14] and here's a broken vase
[02:44:19] that can't be
[02:44:21] completely moves along tracks from start
[02:44:23] to finish
[02:44:24] I couldn't have hit the vase at this
[02:44:25] distance
[02:44:26] [Music]
[02:44:28] note this down too vase of the water
[02:44:32] got hit
[02:44:35] there
[02:44:39] all right
[02:44:41] um I'm happy that it shows a check mark
[02:44:43] over the ones that you already did
[02:44:44] because uh in Danganronpa it doesn't and
[02:44:47] I get I'm too [ __ ] stupid to remember
[02:44:48] so I keep going over the same clue like
[02:44:50] 50 times
[02:44:52] before finding the new one a lot is
[02:44:54] required in order to return to the magic
[02:44:55] box above
[02:44:57] okay cool
[02:45:07] High Precision is required
[02:45:10] okay is that it
[02:45:19] I think so
[02:45:21] unless I'm missing one let me just look
[02:45:23] one more time
[02:45:26] it looks like that is oh unless there's
[02:45:27] some here I didn't really check here
[02:45:30] okay there's okay well there's a lot
[02:45:32] more storage boxes all kinds of props
[02:45:35] and costumes are haphazardly stuffed
[02:45:38] inside
[02:45:39] okay what about here
[02:45:41] examine the trolley trolley is crucial
[02:45:44] transformation okay
[02:45:48] oh what is this place offense
[02:45:54] it seems someone could fit through here
[02:45:58] could this have been the suspect's
[02:46:00] Escape Route
[02:46:03] [Music]
[02:46:11] now the magic boxes okay
[02:46:14] okay
[02:46:15] there's a tunnel vent noted
[02:46:18] now we can get out of here
[02:46:20] [Music]
[02:46:23] let's head back up
[02:46:25] foreign
[02:46:40] [ __ ] killing me out
[02:46:43] bro let me out can I not climb the [ __ ]
[02:46:46] he doesn't go to the other ladder okay
[02:46:47] whatever
[02:46:49] haha there's two ladders but only one
[02:46:50] works
[02:46:58] oh I just haven't played his attorney
[02:46:59] yet though not all of them but
[02:47:02] so I don't know which one would be more
[02:47:03] like I just know that this is like
[02:47:05] contain the state of the crime scene
[02:47:08] place to sword
[02:47:11] out what the [ __ ] is malus oh the old
[02:47:13] dude there are several things that don't
[02:47:14] add up here him apologies for the wait
[02:47:17] demoiselle oh apologies for the wait
[02:47:20] what did the guards say
[02:47:22] oh yeah
[02:47:24] they believe oh I'm [ __ ] British I've
[02:47:28] got to take a [ __ ] bro
[02:47:30] speak okay the guards have checked the
[02:47:32] area carefully no one left through the
[02:47:34] basement during the performance or after
[02:47:36] the incident and no one was found hiding
[02:47:39] there
[02:47:40] so the tunnels become like a secret
[02:47:42] chamber then you
[02:47:45] know
[02:47:48] plot chickens
[02:47:51] disappearance and Powell's death
[02:47:55] pen to those who know no wonder for
[02:47:58] arena was so confident in her act in
[02:47:59] other words the
[02:48:03] considerable progress charges and then
[02:48:06] trial
[02:48:08] okay
[02:48:09] they'll announce a sentence that's right
[02:48:12] this is how a trial goes in the opera
[02:48:14] house during the proceedings the Chief
[02:48:16] Justice and the oratories will hear
[02:48:18] statements from both sides dude silver
[02:48:21] does not look like code I'm sorry I
[02:48:23] guess like the hair color maybe but the
[02:48:25] rest does not look like them
[02:48:29] remember that I don't know his name
[02:48:31] because I always call him okay code
[02:48:32] looks like okay pantalones looks like
[02:48:34] okay code the other one's done
[02:48:40] it's as if the oratrice has its own will
[02:48:42] and is a judge in its own right
[02:48:45] this also precludes any kind of
[02:48:47] favoritism on the part of the Chief
[02:48:49] Justice and not that this has ever
[02:48:51] happened anyway once both sides have
[02:48:53] finished speaking the Chief Justice will
[02:48:55] make his final decision
[02:48:57] finally the aura Trace will be consulted
[02:49:00] by officials
[02:49:02] the resultant returns is the will of
[02:49:04] Justice itself
[02:49:10] practice there is very little
[02:49:13] come to the same
[02:49:15] in this uh uh Laura like you could have
[02:49:18] like dissident judges that write their
[02:49:20] opinions a lot of them they do a lot of
[02:49:21] them they'll be like five judges agree
[02:49:23] and then one's like some random idiot
[02:49:24] who's like oh actually and then they'll
[02:49:26] write like an essay of why he doesn't
[02:49:28] agree and then like no one cares and no
[02:49:29] one ever cites it but sometimes it's
[02:49:31] informative and sometimes it's cool but
[02:49:32] here's what it is
[02:49:38] because we've chosen to act as the twins
[02:49:40] proxies that makes us persons relief
[02:49:43] they're
[02:49:50] coming even if that were not so it could
[02:49:52] prove problematic if we happen to spread
[02:49:54] key information about the case ahead of
[02:49:56] time I'm ready to break out at any time
[02:50:02] dad said I didn't find any food of
[02:50:06] course I just hope you don't mind the
[02:50:08] lack of options
[02:50:15] over some tea and sweets
[02:50:18] breaking out suddenly doesn't seem just
[02:50:20] kidding just kidding
[02:50:22] I will still do her best even if there
[02:50:24] are no snaps hmm
[02:50:26] I mean no snacks of course we'll have
[02:50:29] snacks if we cannot buy some then we'll
[02:50:32] simply make some okay Chad respectfully
[02:50:33] and I mean this with literally the most
[02:50:36] respect possible genuinely like
[02:50:38] genuinely respectfully I just now
[02:50:42] noticed
[02:50:44] how do I say this nicely I noticed
[02:50:45] navia's thighs I just wanted to mention
[02:50:47] it in case you're like oh I love my I
[02:50:49] just want to mention it no no like
[02:50:51] disrespectfully uh uh compliments of the
[02:50:53] artist that's all I'm saying sir
[02:50:57] I have eggs sugar and almonds at the
[02:50:59] ready cool
[02:51:07] enough these three are quite the
[02:51:10] interesting group
[02:51:13] methodologically handles the ingredients
[02:51:15] and pulls fresh macaroons out of the she
[02:51:17] made his macaroons
[02:51:19] Ryan can't do that
[02:51:21] Rider would have burnt the [ __ ] high
[02:51:22] style house down
[02:51:24] [Music]
[02:51:25] your macarons are so good
[02:51:31] bring the baking process
[02:51:34] foreign
[02:51:36] shut the [ __ ] up no one asked you I'm
[02:51:39] sorry
[02:51:41] I'm sorry
[02:51:42] I was applauding
[02:51:45] I was giving encouraging smiles
[02:51:48] aren't you worried about getting your
[02:51:50] fancy dress dirty beating egg whites and
[02:51:52] baking like this
[02:51:55] well I don't think it's carved in stone
[02:51:57] anywhere that fancy ladies can only read
[02:51:59] books sip tea ride horses and play the
[02:52:02] piano true I just really enjoy making
[02:52:05] snacks don't underestimate beating egg
[02:52:07] whites by the way it's a real arm
[02:52:09] workout true you also need to beat them
[02:52:11] to just the right consistency or your
[02:52:13] macarons will crack
[02:52:15] anyway give these a try fresh out of the
[02:52:17] oven there's three for each of us only
[02:52:21] well eating too it's actually better to
[02:52:23] hand whisk your egg whites or your
[02:52:25] whipped cream because it leaves more
[02:52:27] like air pockets in it whereas a
[02:52:28] mechanical electric blender will
[02:52:30] actually like do it too fast and
[02:52:31] there'll be no more air and it'll be
[02:52:33] less fluffy true and uh uh Taylor Swift
[02:52:36] whatever her name is Navia she knows
[02:52:37] that fragrance the mind and lift
[02:52:48] all right then
[02:52:49] down to business
[02:52:52] mentioned previously the tunnel seems to
[02:52:55] be something of a secret chamber
[02:52:58] however we can assume that Lenny and
[02:53:00] Lynette were not alone within it some
[02:53:02] Chris Kelly thinks they're two years
[02:53:04] confined the magician twins could have
[02:53:07] committed the crimes of course but they
[02:53:10] lack any logical motive exactly it's
[02:53:13] funny because the real Taylor Swift
[02:53:14] likes baking them out yeah uh the one
[02:53:16] time yeah yeah last time I hung out with
[02:53:18] Taylor she actually made me some snacks
[02:53:20] because she's like yo you're a big
[02:53:20] inspiration of mine no big deal but yeah
[02:53:22] I knew that too so that's pretty cool
[02:53:24] anyways uh part of the Twins were left
[02:53:25] with two other people the missing girl
[02:53:26] and the deceased true
[02:53:31] yeah altercation
[02:53:33] in the tunnel resulting in the
[02:53:35] shattering of the vase the discarding of
[02:53:37] her clothes and her abduction perhaps
[02:53:40] the criminal thought that since she was
[02:53:41] chosen from the crowd she would be too
[02:53:43] easy to identify if she was still
[02:53:45] wearing the same clothes
[02:53:48] that makes sense but the real trouble is
[02:53:52] there's no person there's no visit this
[02:53:54] third person even exists
[02:53:57] we found thus far support the existence
[02:53:59] of this third person but the only people
[02:54:02] left to consider are both technically
[02:54:05] victims whether it's the missing girl oh
[02:54:07] Cowell isn't actually dead and he
[02:54:10] kidnapped
[02:54:11] and all of these secretly made
[02:54:13] modifications to the magic props in
[02:54:16] order to murder Cowell before making her
[02:54:18] Escape
[02:54:20] that's right and even if she had
[02:54:22] tampered with a setup she would need to
[02:54:24] understand the entire trick to pull it
[02:54:26] off
[02:54:27] or does she have any motive the guard
[02:54:29] said that she has never had any dealings
[02:54:31] with the magic troops members
[02:54:37] of things this is turned to a few
[02:54:39] macarons are amazing though true thanks
[02:54:41] Nadia
[02:54:51] please don't worry about it at my age a
[02:54:55] few less sweets might actually be a good
[02:54:57] thing
[02:54:59] um time on 80 many
[02:55:04] knows that if she ate too many then
[02:55:06] others wouldn't have enough
[02:55:12] nobody cares on the [ __ ] my group did
[02:55:15] he get it well I suppose one of us might
[02:55:18] have gotten too engrossed in our chat
[02:55:19] and eaten them by mistake no but the
[02:55:21] loose set up the stove again if you
[02:55:23] would
[02:55:24] huh making sure everyone gets three
[02:55:27] macarons of course
[02:55:31] I trouble you as you wish the mother and
[02:55:35] I have the egg surely this is important
[02:55:36] to the story and someone ate two
[02:55:38] macaroons because if not why would this
[02:55:40] be a whole ass cutscene surely if this
[02:55:42] has nothing to do with anything I'll be
[02:55:43] pissed surely someone ate this oh it was
[02:55:45] a cat oh silly goose
[02:55:49] but we've still got some time as
[02:55:52] attorneys I suggest the two of you think
[02:55:54] the case over again it would be awkward
[02:55:57] if you got all tongue-tied on stage
[02:55:58] during the trial
[02:56:00] maybe we're just nervous around you w
[02:56:02] rizz
[02:56:03] [Music]
[02:56:13] uh probably the third person being
[02:56:15] involved another calendar house
[02:56:16] Automotive but after talking to Navia
[02:56:17] later three percent seems very low
[02:56:28] wait until the following day
[02:56:31] okay
[02:56:33] I love changing the time
[02:56:38] foreign
[02:56:42] but surely we're about to finish the
[02:56:45] quest so I don't actually need to get
[02:56:46] food for the Stream True that's a lie
[02:56:48] it's probably gonna take another [ __ ]
[02:56:49] 17 hours so we'll probably get it later
[02:56:52] wait why did okay I don't have my phone
[02:56:54] so I can't see notifications but why did
[02:56:57] why okay yo yo why did yo why did koi
[02:57:02] reply to this tweet with how did you
[02:57:04] know it was my birthday

[02:57:16] days so

[02:57:26] in nine days
[02:57:31] gif

[02:57:36] Overlord okay
[02:57:38] um let me search Albedo genchen Albedo
[02:57:40] genshin
[02:57:47] [ __ ] are these
[02:57:52] okay these are terrible
[02:58:00] okay I'll just I'll just no GIF I guess
[02:58:14] banned no I think they're fine let me
[02:58:17] wait let me search again offstream what
[02:58:18] was the Albedo one I think that's fine
[02:58:19] right
[02:58:20] I didn't see any Bubba yeah no no that's
[02:58:23] nothing
[02:58:26] yeah no
[02:58:34] you got so lucky yeah maybe I should
[02:58:36] have searched it on stream but all good
[02:58:38] this place is pretty elegant
[02:58:53] what do we do whole situation is so
[02:58:57] confusing
[02:58:59] is the made out of it comfy no not at
[02:59:01] all impossible it's tight so okay
[02:59:05] I'm tall but I'm not like even
[02:59:09] even like I'm relatively small like like
[02:59:12] in terms of like like I'm huge I'm
[02:59:13] [ __ ] massive but like because I'm so
[02:59:15] tall I have to buy the size for tall
[02:59:18] people but it also assumes I'm like
[02:59:19] larger than I am so like for example
[02:59:22] I kind of have to go in the middle
[02:59:24] ground where it's like the the thing
[02:59:25] that's supposed to go to my waist is
[02:59:27] like here it's like mid like
[02:59:29] abdominal whereas it's supposed to be
[02:59:31] like here so it's like higher because
[02:59:32] I'm taller but but but but and then here
[02:59:35] it's like tight and then my legs are
[02:59:37] cold but it is where it is
[02:59:40] all right Navia doesn't think it's
[02:59:42] linear either or we're supporting them
[02:59:52] well we'll be going then
[02:59:55] best of luck to you
[03:00:05] she's papega true
[03:00:08] she is
[03:00:11] all right what's up finally you're back
[03:00:14] well how did your investigation go uh
[03:00:17] you're guilty
[03:00:20] disappointment it is looking around for
[03:00:21] you we're already very grateful that you
[03:00:23] were willing to help
[03:00:24] now
[03:00:26] oh look disappointed don't tell me that
[03:00:29] your investigation came up empty-handed
[03:00:33] and that was to be expected of course
[03:00:35] the guilty can never produce proof of
[03:00:38] their innocence
[03:00:39] no but don't let that stop you I shall
[03:00:43] be terribly disappointed should you my
[03:00:46] most anticipated foe concede so easily
[03:00:50] since both parties are present I declare
[03:00:53] that the trial regarding them dude look
[03:00:56] at his chest
[03:00:57] firstly
[03:00:59] the audience to understand the causes
[03:01:01] and results of the incident could we
[03:01:03] please have Mr Linney explain farina's
[03:01:05] the archon of Justice isn't she like I
[03:01:07] will explain while Lynette demonstrates
[03:01:09] on stage okay not to sound like the
[03:01:11] cringe people on [ __ ] Twitter but if
[03:01:14] free does the archive Justice wouldn't
[03:01:15] she be like
[03:01:16] you're innocent until we prove otherwise
[03:01:18] why is she like accusing people
[03:01:24] thank you Mr Linney in that case I take
[03:01:27] your statement to be that
[03:01:29] you ran to and remained hidden within
[03:01:31] the magic she loves the drama that's
[03:01:33] true I guess the trick began and thus
[03:01:36] could not have committed the crime is
[03:01:38] this correct yes that's correct your
[03:01:40] honor okay in that case I call upon the
[03:01:43] prosecution lady Farina
[03:01:46] do you wish to refute his statement in
[03:01:49] any way
[03:01:50] my of course I do why is she so close to
[03:01:52] the camera
[03:01:55] case why is wide open
[03:01:57] [Music]
[03:02:00] okay
[03:02:01] bold words I like the pose though I do
[03:02:03] like the pose
[03:02:05] way you could have been in the Box the
[03:02:07] whole time if you were to abduct Halsey
[03:02:10] and murder Cowell in fact I'd say yes
[03:02:15] those are some sentences she just said
[03:02:17] hey okay okay Farina simply your
[03:02:20] hypothesis based on the presumption that
[03:02:22] I'm guilty okay
[03:02:25] is that so what's that split screen
[03:02:27] transition
[03:02:30] you were inside your box good question
[03:02:33] the Roaring countdown of the crowd of
[03:02:35] course good answer that's how I kept
[03:02:37] track of the time and built anticipation
[03:02:39] for the finale
[03:02:40] and you didn't hear anything else at all
[03:02:44] nothing that might leave an impression
[03:02:46] of any kind
[03:02:48] no nothing
[03:02:50] what about the bang that's when the
[03:02:53] counter reached 30 seconds or so there
[03:02:55] was a thud one so loud that I believe
[03:02:58] practically everyone you fell for my
[03:03:00] trap
[03:03:02] well I need the sound effect ah whatever
[03:03:04] I'm gonna find a time all good
[03:03:08] here
[03:03:10] yeah Lenny how come you don't know what
[03:03:12] the sound yeah I'm sure he could have
[03:03:14] heard a noise that loud from inside the
[03:03:15] Box
[03:03:16] I was right by the box and I definitely
[03:03:18] heard the thud
[03:03:20] no one asked you suspicious audience
[03:03:22] member you don't have a [ __ ] name
[03:03:24] that's how irrelevant you are
[03:03:32] well then ladies and gentlemen allow me
[03:03:36] to use the words of the magician himself
[03:03:39] you never know what can happen in the
[03:03:42] blink of an eye
[03:03:44] indeed it seems his Alibi can also
[03:03:47] collapse oh no I was underground I
[03:03:49] promise
[03:03:50] sorry of course I have armed myself to
[03:03:53] do far more than smash your Alibi
[03:03:56] confidence cannot go unfounded and my
[03:04:00] foundations are Rock Solid okay aren't
[03:04:05] you and Lynette actually from the house
[03:04:07] of the hearth
[03:04:13] oh yeah they are for doing I see we knew
[03:04:16] it
[03:04:18] no wonder they did something like this
[03:04:21] so the serial disappearances were the
[03:04:23] fatou he's doing now it all makes sense
[03:04:26] I've got a feeling that what happened on
[03:04:28] stage probably wasn't just an accident
[03:04:34] that's irrelevant our identities have
[03:04:36] nothing to do with what happened
[03:04:39] true but also minus two fatouies doesn't
[03:04:42] sound that bad but you're right it
[03:04:44] doesn't have anything to do with this
[03:04:45] case
[03:04:46] true
[03:04:47] perhaps everything that happened during
[03:04:49] that one minute
[03:04:51] yeah
[03:04:53] your first innocent after all I'm sure
[03:04:56] there is little that needs to be kept
[03:04:57] secret now
[03:04:59] unless you're script already has holes
[03:05:02] in it
[03:05:06] what was that it's speechless
[03:05:10] what the [ __ ] is this
[03:05:15] now comes the infighting in Discord
[03:05:17] Discord yeah farina's gonna call me on
[03:05:19] Discord yeah we're close like that
[03:05:26] yeah who's the all-nighter I pulled last
[03:05:28] night is real okay all right
[03:05:33] she's just goofy
[03:05:36] Goofy
[03:05:39] dude we're literally best friends with
[03:05:41] child and Wanderer I guess wander kind
[03:05:44] of got debated by datori but it doesn't
[03:05:45] matter we're literally we're literally
[03:05:46] child
[03:05:49] order order
[03:05:52] Mr Linney allow me to re-establish the
[03:05:54] facts lady Farina has raised two points
[03:05:57] first when the thud was heard in the
[03:06:00] Opera House you were neither in the box
[03:06:01] nor the tunnel true thank you you and Ms
[03:06:04] Lynette are both members of the House of
[03:06:06] the Hearth I feel like Farina just says
[03:06:08] whatever's on her goofy mind and then
[03:06:09] navient actually like makes sense Navia
[03:06:12] is just like the
[03:06:14] he's just like a yeah she's kind of
[03:06:15] she's kind of out of her mind but
[03:06:17] you know we like her that's not yet are
[03:06:20] these claims true
[03:06:22] that's like
[03:06:25] not me chat
[03:06:26] navient is ours
[03:06:30] I'm Farina and if it is a Jeff
[03:06:34] there's no doubt about a magician's
[03:06:36] ability to con others given how Lenny it
[03:06:37] because concealer's identity this could
[03:06:39] all have been set up beforehand
[03:06:43] plus child is here in Fontana that's
[03:06:44] actually true and [ __ ] Lenny was like
[03:06:47] daddy's coming home to [ __ ] his
[03:06:49] little brother whatever his [ __ ] name
[03:06:51] is which might be arlikino just saying
[03:06:56] please answer my question Mr Linney
[03:07:00] sorry
[03:07:02] yes they're true your honor
[03:07:06] okay
[03:07:09] okay eyes looking I knew it
[03:07:13] didn't know anything man that's it we
[03:07:15] might as well move on to the sentencing
[03:07:16] already this is literally twitch shot
[03:07:18] this is literally twitch shot they're
[03:07:20] like oh hi we knew it and then they know
[03:07:22] nothing freak you chat
[03:07:24] my defense cannot proceed in that case
[03:07:26] what is your request I request a be
[03:07:29] brief adjourment is that really Siri
[03:07:31] they're already as good as guilty the
[03:07:34] defendant deceived their own attorneys
[03:07:36] you guys are acting like it's not you
[03:07:38] but you know for a fact if you guys are
[03:07:40] in the audience and Farina was talking
[03:07:41] you'd be like so true Farina and then
[03:07:43] the the lydney would die order order I
[03:07:46] say
[03:07:49] your request is reasonable and we shall
[03:07:52] adjourn
[03:07:53] this trial will reconvene in one hour
[03:07:55] maybe not all of you but like 60 70 80.
[03:07:59] you would stick to Mr Lenny's defense
[03:08:01] even after knowing what you do now
[03:08:04] you certainly have more professionalism
[03:08:06] than I thought in that case my dear dear
[03:08:10] oh I really like her outfits allow the
[03:08:12] joy of Victory I like her hat too a
[03:08:14] little
[03:08:15] [Music]
[03:08:18] also like her laugh
[03:08:21] toothpaste hair true she does look like
[03:08:24] [ __ ] Crest toothpaste
[03:08:26] nine out of ten dentists
[03:08:29] farina's the 10th dentist we found we
[03:08:31] found the one that disagrees well this
[03:08:35] is
[03:08:37] I didn't think the hydroarcon would take
[03:08:39] all that up I'm sorry yeah
[03:08:48] [Music]
[03:08:50] guys
[03:08:52] let's set the wrong tone or anything but
[03:08:55] I'm very sorry
[03:08:58] I know you're angry and reasonably so
[03:09:00] but please let me explain I know you've
[03:09:04] clashed with a batui several times
[03:09:05] before I wouldn't be surprised if just
[03:09:08] hearing the word is enough to make you
[03:09:10] upset I can't wait for the story of dude
[03:09:13] look I know Lenny is probably like he's
[03:09:16] like a kid right kind of but it's
[03:09:18] probably articino like pulling strings
[03:09:20] and [ __ ] but I love how Gidget has to do
[03:09:22] this thing where it's like oh no the
[03:09:23] playable character isn't actually evil
[03:09:25] here's why and then they just explain it
[03:09:27] oh okay child's cool oh wander he's a
[03:09:30] good guy and then okay but surely we can
[03:09:32] play evil characters because I know for
[03:09:34] a fact the Tori is not getting a
[03:09:35] Redemption Arc he [ __ ] better not but
[03:09:37] we I still want to play him I want him
[03:09:39] to die but I want to play him but our
[03:09:41] organization is very very large and the
[03:09:44] harbingers have very different
[03:09:45] personalities and goals right now we
[03:09:48] want to save people as many Travelers
[03:09:51] and Friends of child dude we were like
[03:09:53] dude we were like Against Child and then
[03:09:54] he rised us up he showed us his little
[03:09:56] brother it was propaganda oh look I'm
[03:09:58] two sir's big brother oh I make Rune
[03:10:01] guards and now we're like all right I
[03:10:02] love you child that's how it went
[03:10:05] that's right I'm sure we're on this now
[03:10:07] we have his vision he has too much
[03:10:08] disaster that it's people might face
[03:10:13] I knew if it weren't for our respective
[03:10:15] identities we could become good friends
[03:10:20] that's why I didn't wish to flat out lie
[03:10:22] to you but chose to hide some details
[03:10:24] instead the truth is very important but
[03:10:27] being completely transparent about
[03:10:29] everything would see us spending more
[03:10:30] effort than we need to
[03:10:42] right
[03:10:43] so you be the judge Heck if I were you I
[03:10:47] fear that I'd even struggle to trust me
[03:10:49] at this point
[03:10:50] [Music]
[03:10:51] yeah well okay Travelers kind of like
[03:10:53] kind of like doesn't trust child it's
[03:10:55] kind of like neutral face but then every
[03:10:56] time child shows up he's like oh hey
[03:10:58] bestie and then I feel like deep down
[03:10:59] inside the mean like child or ether
[03:11:01] whoever it doesn't matter I'm saying I
[03:11:03] feel like trying to like like they're
[03:11:04] like won't admit it but like they're
[03:11:05] homies they just won't admit it
[03:11:08] I don't know I don't know I don't know I
[03:11:09] don't know I'm just saying because
[03:11:11] eventually we know this in patch like
[03:11:13] 5.8 or 6.4 or 7.1 child's gonna be like
[03:11:17] gonna sacrifice himself to save us and
[03:11:19] then we're gonna be like oh my God
[03:11:20] tartaglia and then he's gonna die but
[03:11:22] it's gonna be like a villain Redemption
[03:11:24] Arc where he's like an like he's like
[03:11:25] not a good guy but not a bad guy and he
[03:11:27] kind of like saved us true
[03:11:29] you met a fatous who works as a magician
[03:11:32] by trade all by coincidence too
[03:11:37] but still I'm asking you to trust me I
[03:11:41] am no criminal I don't think your word
[03:11:42] for it I trust you please forgive us all
[03:11:44] right I forgive you
[03:11:47] explain the other issue
[03:11:52] I'll answer any question you ask I asked
[03:11:55] you just [ __ ] say everything bro what
[03:11:57] do you mean
[03:11:57] [Music]
[03:11:59] we want to know why it has Consciousness
[03:12:01] why can it deliver sentences accurately
[03:12:05] during our investigations we learned
[03:12:07] that the machine's core is beneath it
[03:12:09] from that moment on Lynette and I have
[03:12:11] been designing this box swap trick with
[03:12:13] the objective of getting close to the
[03:12:15] Core
[03:12:17] is that what you needed
[03:12:19] a hole that's right in truth the
[03:12:22] audience would take about 75 seconds to
[03:12:24] count down from 60 while I would only
[03:12:26] need 15 to get to the opposite box
[03:12:29] so after jumping into the tunnel I
[03:12:31] access the opera house basement via the
[03:12:33] vent and when to investigate the room in
[03:12:36] which the core is stored that air vent
[03:12:38] was created during the construction of
[03:12:40] the tunnel specifically to execute the
[03:12:42] step well nothing
[03:12:45] as soon as I reached that room and was
[03:12:47] about to investigate I heard someone's
[03:12:49] voice vashi which should have been
[03:12:51] impossible never mind of course I was
[03:12:53] quite certain that I was the only one in
[03:12:55] the room he vented the boys seemed to
[03:12:57] recognize me and tried to speak to me I
[03:12:59] chose to err on the side of caution wait
[03:13:02] that's how you spell air
[03:13:03] okay I did not know I thought error was
[03:13:07] like energy regeneration rate or
[03:13:09] whatever almost finished so there wasn't
[03:13:11] time to give it any thought
[03:13:14] after that the homicide occurred just as
[03:13:17] you saw well that explains why you
[03:13:19] didn't hear the thud
[03:13:21] but while you are understand how the
[03:13:22] onatis operates because of that prophecy
[03:13:25] I told you about of course we must know
[03:13:27] all we can about this nation's secrets
[03:13:30] in order to deal with that prophesized
[03:13:31] crisis that's the only way we can save
[03:13:34] everyone so there you have it the whole
[03:13:37] truth
[03:13:38] I swear I didn't hide anything from you
[03:13:41] this time it was never my wish to
[03:13:43] proceed Under This Cloud of mistrust
[03:13:45] either but like I said earlier you can
[03:13:47] be the judge
[03:13:49] if you want to leave because you don't
[03:13:50] trust the fatoui there's nothing I can
[03:13:52] do to stop you
[03:13:54] [Music]
[03:13:59] I believe in the facts
[03:14:03] I'll defend you from these charges
[03:14:05] thank you thanks for giving us a check
[03:14:13] conversations we're gonna need a
[03:14:15] seriously water type defense we already
[03:14:17] have the key we need
[03:14:18] the adjournment's almost over let's go
[03:14:20] back
[03:14:21] Lenny claims that he headed to the
[03:14:23] chamber containing the agathis core upon
[03:14:25] entering the tunnel and did not witness
[03:14:27] the witness the crime taking place
[03:14:31] and then hear the thud
[03:14:34] mysterious voice
[03:14:37] okay
[03:14:38] interesting interesting interesting
[03:14:40] interesting one again new mail
[03:14:41] interesting interesting
[03:14:48] interesting
[03:14:53] the brief adjournment ends
[03:14:57] both parties have returned to their
[03:14:59] positions let us continue the trial okay
[03:15:02] when last we left off Mr Linney
[03:15:04] acknowledged the New Evidence presented
[03:15:06] by Lady Farina as fact therefore lady
[03:15:09] Farina may continue stating her
[03:15:11] reconstruction of the events okay
[03:15:15] that took long enough
[03:15:17] now then if everyone would lend me their
[03:15:20] attention
[03:15:21] oh whatever glows is white one of them's
[03:15:24] black or like blue I didn't know there
[03:15:25] were different colors it's cool
[03:15:30] business oppositions account of events
[03:15:32] you can identify loopholes like okay
[03:15:34] this is literally
[03:15:36] use evidence and clues to refute any
[03:15:38] iranis assortments of facts
[03:15:42] dude
[03:15:53] it's a [ __ ]
[03:15:55] wait what's this song called uh
[03:16:02] [Music]
[03:16:04] God I got it
[03:16:06] when you finally reviewed all incorrect
[03:16:08] content you can complete the cycle of
[03:16:10] reputation
[03:16:14] as the countdown began he entered the
[03:16:17] tunnel
[03:16:20] okay
[03:16:22] when the flatbed trolley passed he
[03:16:25] opened the box and got into an
[03:16:27] altercation with Halsey which caused the
[03:16:29] loud thud
[03:16:31] no but okay he did not realize that this
[03:16:35] sound could be heard by everyone in the
[03:16:37] opera house which is why he claimed
[03:16:39] earlier that he could not hear the sound
[03:16:42] finally he used the boss to knock her
[03:16:45] out before making her change clothes to
[03:16:47] prevent others from recognizing her
[03:16:50] at this time Cowell arrived haven't
[03:16:54] heard
[03:16:55] this is gonna be fast
[03:17:00] so Lenny
[03:17:02] press to come out too before not true
[03:17:05] he's guilty
[03:17:14] spreading the devices such that cow's
[03:17:16] death would be ruled an accident
[03:17:21] and there you have it that's the truth
[03:17:24] behind what happened does the
[03:17:26] defendant's side have any objections yes
[03:17:29] the key to Refuge
[03:17:33] oh the means talking
[03:17:37] no that's wrong that's wrong
[03:17:49] oh do I choose a [ __ ] truthful to
[03:17:51] review it okay so Lenny claims I did not
[03:17:54] witness the craw yes
[03:17:58] no
[03:17:59] no
[03:18:02] no yes what's this
[03:18:05] whoa
[03:18:11] oh Lenny entered okay that was
[03:18:13] that was this one what I meant what I
[03:18:15] meant to use was for this one I didn't
[03:18:17] mean it for this one for this one it's
[03:18:18] easy so he didn't enter the tunnel
[03:18:19] because uh uh uh
[03:18:22] uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
[03:18:28] no it can't be that
[03:18:32] [ __ ] it we'll we'll review this one so
[03:18:34] we use this here
[03:18:36] I am so intellect
[03:18:43] no copium okay
[03:18:46] uh do I repeat all of them let's do this
[03:18:48] one let me kidnapped Halsey uh well he
[03:18:51] wasn't in the [ __ ] tunnel I told you
[03:18:53] I [ __ ] told you
[03:18:55] well do I still refuted if I just
[03:18:57] repeated this one because the same thing
[03:18:58] he's on the I just told you why he's not
[03:18:59] in the tunnel
[03:19:01] uh when the knee returned to the tunnel
[03:19:03] the crime had already taken place and
[03:19:05] all that Lenny saw was
[03:19:07] the clothes
[03:19:12] let him cook where's the music
[03:19:16] no this song's no it's not the right one
[03:19:20] that's the same one
[03:19:30] I met together this design ready
[03:19:31] activated
[03:19:34] [Applause]
[03:19:38] wait what
[03:19:44] do you have to refute all of them I feel
[03:19:46] like
[03:19:47] I feel like this can't happen if this
[03:19:49] happened and then this I guess is this
[03:19:50] one
[03:19:54] wait what is this a meticulous design uh
[03:19:57] claims have heard
[03:20:01] [ __ ] it I
[03:20:05] okay Enter the tunnel
[03:20:07] um
[03:20:14] victory
[03:20:17] dude I refuted the two ones that
[03:20:19] mattered
[03:20:22] this doesn't say anything wait let me
[03:20:24] read it again this is a water break
[03:20:27] [Music]
[03:20:38] oh you have to do all of all the okay I
[03:20:40] see
[03:20:42] Lenny claims that he headed into the
[03:20:45] chamber chamber you want to play Let's
[03:20:48] Play containing the uh that's his core
[03:20:50] about entering the tunnel and did not
[03:20:52] witness the crime thus he didn't hear
[03:20:54] the thud which is something that we
[03:20:56] could use
[03:21:04] [ __ ] it yup
[03:21:08] uh-huh so
[03:21:10] okay cool yeah you're after all of them
[03:21:11] that's what I thought okay cool
[03:21:14] because I was like how the [ __ ] could
[03:21:15] you do all of them it makes sense
[03:21:17] easy
[03:21:21] did indeed go into the tunnel true but
[03:21:25] he
[03:21:26] an event to access the opera house
[03:21:28] basement which is where the
[03:21:33] door sure
[03:21:38] empty room but it wasn't
[03:21:41] something was amiss he returned
[03:21:43] immediately
[03:21:46] true
[03:21:49] [Music]
[03:21:51] it's okay
[03:21:54] bro admitted he vented
[03:22:00] sorry
[03:22:03] yep
[03:22:10] successful refutation
[03:22:13] wait refutation refutation
[03:22:17] what the [ __ ] is a refutation
[03:22:30] yeah
[03:22:31] is that how you spell it oh
[03:22:39] tation
[03:22:41] I'm listening I'm tired listen it's
[03:22:44] tayshen like ta and then TI is like a I
[03:22:47] get it shut the [ __ ] up shut the [ __ ] up
[03:22:49] I am I was I was
[03:22:54] that's right
[03:22:58] my reasoning no foreign
[03:23:03] equipment was clearly tampered with but
[03:23:06] you say cow will bumped into Lenny
[03:23:16] wait Chad how long did you guys say act
[03:23:18] one would take
[03:23:20] [Music]
[03:23:28] it three to four points
[03:23:30] I think
[03:23:32] [Music]
[03:23:33] that's why they're partners of mine true
[03:23:35] me and Navia we go way back yeah
[03:23:38] I was at her concert on her first tour
[03:23:41] very strident I'll give you that
[03:23:44] about what proof do you have to back
[03:23:47] your claims
[03:23:49] uh you happen to remember how you
[03:23:51] refuted Lenny's initial alibi
[03:23:54] of course I do if he had been in the
[03:23:57] magic box the whole time how could he
[03:24:00] have not heard that sound
[03:24:02] do you ask
[03:24:04] you're saying that he wasn't
[03:24:09] your claim has now become my weapon your
[03:24:12] claim has also become a critical clue
[03:24:18] what choose wait uh well evidence okay
[03:24:23] what irrelevant
[03:24:26] okay so we have to choose
[03:24:28] what makes sense wait was I reading okay
[03:24:30] I'm just gonna pretend I read okay so
[03:24:32] she said okay
[03:24:33] how's he's a missing person during the
[03:24:36] performance there's an audible thump
[03:24:38] no one left oh this is okay
[03:24:49] I think it's that no one left but wait
[03:24:51] what the [ __ ] what did we say again wait
[03:24:52] so she refuted
[03:24:54] Lily's thing when he said that he went
[03:24:56] in the Box no that he wasn't or whatever
[03:24:59] the [ __ ] she was like yeah you entered
[03:25:00] the box and then you must have heard it
[03:25:02] but then he was like no I wasn't which
[03:25:03] means
[03:25:09] was it just this
[03:25:10] okay no one gives a [ __ ] about it has to
[03:25:12] be unless it's not this
[03:25:14] okay
[03:25:16] yeah that's right
[03:25:20] he was an event
[03:25:26] true
[03:25:27] you use to disprove his Alibi dude I
[03:25:29] wasn't the Imposter I was in the van I
[03:25:31] didn't kill it dude I didn't kill that I
[03:25:33] I was I was in the van
[03:25:37] thanks navio I think you'd use such
[03:25:40] logic
[03:25:43] well then
[03:25:44] wasn't Lenny who committed the crimes
[03:25:46] then who wasn't
[03:25:50] the murder was
[03:25:54] [Music]
[03:25:57] logic chain
[03:26:02] the cars investigation report against
[03:26:04] the fireworks near the end of the show
[03:26:06] indicated it ignited ignited like League
[03:26:09] of Legend and burned through the ropes
[03:26:11] suspending the water tank above the
[03:26:12] stage this caused the water tank to fall
[03:26:15] and kill Cowell in the box below
[03:26:23] if Lindy's no longer suspicion only the
[03:26:24] other members of The Troop would be able
[03:26:26] to Tamper the props okay no spoil this
[03:26:28] for this trap I got this demons
[03:26:33] supposed to work by using a box out of
[03:26:35] the box and then lady changes with him
[03:26:38] let me yup
[03:26:40] the clothes belong to Halsey they went
[03:26:43] missing okay
[03:26:44] select any clue wait who was the person
[03:26:46] who could have committed the crime
[03:26:52] all right let me see what they say
[03:26:55] I'm not gonna look at Chad for a bit
[03:26:58] well actually let me okay close chat
[03:27:10] [Music]
[03:27:14] stop really a possibility
[03:27:19] okay my heart was like yo there's a
[03:27:22] third but there can't be because the
[03:27:23] little girl at the front I was like no
[03:27:25] no so it can't be that it's dumb to
[03:27:26] click it because of what we know in game
[03:27:28] they don't want us to click this I saw
[03:27:29] it well as I got what if it's just but
[03:27:31] it's not that so it's one of these two
[03:27:32] realistically do we know this guy's dead
[03:27:35] we didn't see his body did we I feel
[03:27:37] like if he was dead we'd [ __ ] know
[03:27:38] they're just like oh their God will die
[03:27:39] but like how the [ __ ] do we know
[03:27:41] name is Cowell and then he's assistant
[03:27:44] palsy is the missing person and an
[03:27:46] ordinary audience member
[03:27:49] or
[03:27:50] she have her own
[03:27:59] the deceased's name is Cowell okay where
[03:28:01] the [ __ ] is his body
[03:28:05] let me watch out again
[03:28:09] I'm too good dude we would have seen his
[03:28:11] [ __ ] body
[03:28:13] where's in his [ __ ] body every
[03:28:15] [ __ ] Danganronpa execution you see
[03:28:17] their body
[03:28:20] we did
[03:28:23] he died yeah it was probably a [ __ ]
[03:28:25] fake body oh maybe he did die okay maybe
[03:28:27] he did die maybe he did die maybe he
[03:28:29] died but then he was being used okay but
[03:28:31] it couldn't have been the [ __ ] girl
[03:28:32] anyways doesn't matter it was literally
[03:28:34] a 50 50. and then there's no way as a
[03:28:36] girl
[03:28:37] oh yeah serial killer kidnaps women and
[03:28:40] it's her who kidnapped herself
[03:28:42] okay let's say it's her let's say it was
[03:28:44] her what would have been the point of
[03:28:46] the [ __ ] crime to kill a random dude
[03:28:48] wow
[03:28:57] reasoning then what I must do next is
[03:28:59] recreate the truth
[03:29:01] what Howell did and how he went we
[03:29:04] learned how to make a [ __ ] comic book
[03:29:13] um Let Me Close chat again
[03:29:15] okay
[03:29:19] Lenny as having been unable to interfere
[03:29:21] with the crime okay so we'll start with
[03:29:24] Lenny was not in the tunnel at that
[03:29:26] moment which gave our criminal ample
[03:29:29] time
[03:29:32] we heard may have come from a clock
[03:29:35] all right let me let me I wanted to hear
[03:29:37] that again
[03:29:40] so there must have been some fear that
[03:29:43] she would attract attention
[03:29:45] the deceased's name is Cowell Mimi's
[03:29:48] assistant
[03:29:49] he would have been able to tamper with
[03:29:51] the equipment
[03:29:52] no one entered or left the Opera House
[03:29:55] through its entrances
[03:29:57] so
[03:29:58] where would the criminal have wanted to
[03:30:00] take Halsey
[03:30:02] it was shangling she cooked her and then
[03:30:05] they ate she returned at the food
[03:30:07] knowing the Del she was gone Shang Ling
[03:30:09] was actually the murderer the whole time
[03:30:12] sorry
[03:30:13] um no one entered or left
[03:30:15] okay
[03:30:22] they would likely have bumped into Lenny
[03:30:25] as well
[03:30:27] Lenny was not in the tunnel at that
[03:30:30] moment which gave our criminal ample
[03:30:32] time
[03:30:34] the deceased's name is Cowell when he's
[03:30:37] just
[03:30:38] halsey's clothing was in the tunnel
[03:30:41] so there must have been some fear that
[03:30:44] she would attract attention I don't get
[03:30:46] what the so there must have been some
[03:30:47] failure to attract attention means
[03:30:49] sound we heard may have come from a
[03:30:51] clash between the missing Halsey and the
[03:30:53] criminal
[03:30:56] okay so that's the thought that probably
[03:30:57] goes there like second and then it's
[03:30:59] like
[03:31:00] like two three and then four is one of
[03:31:02] them and then five is the other one of
[03:31:03] them
[03:31:05] it would have been tough for both people
[03:31:06] to fit into that vent
[03:31:09] Lenny was not in the tunnel at that [ __ ]
[03:31:11] it
[03:31:13] okay halsey's clothing was in the tunnel
[03:31:16] does that mean this right
[03:31:18] so there must have been some fear that
[03:31:20] she would attract the sound we heard may
[03:31:22] have come from a clash between the
[03:31:24] missing that's probably third I guess
[03:31:25] and then second would be like
[03:31:29] the deceased's name is
[03:31:31] uh I'm not sure the order I guess the is
[03:31:34] that a grief it might be this one it
[03:31:36] would have been tough for both people to
[03:31:39] shorty
[03:31:40] halsey's clothing [ __ ] it
[03:31:44] oh the question changed I didn't even
[03:31:46] notice clothing oh I'm right oh I'm so
[03:31:49] good okay
[03:31:51] who's the Prime Suspect this guy's name
[03:31:53] is Cowell
[03:31:54] where the missing houses go uh she can't
[03:31:57] go in the van she can't go out here so
[03:31:58] it's whatever this is
[03:32:01] thank you
[03:32:04] it would have been tough for both people
[03:32:06] to fit into that vent
[03:32:08] they would like I mean she could also
[03:32:10] went into the event after Lenny left is
[03:32:11] that a dumb take What if after Lenny
[03:32:13] left the vent they [ __ ] trucked her
[03:32:14] in the vent
[03:32:16] you probably could have done that it's
[03:32:18] not that
[03:32:20] I didn't music like that
[03:32:27] I mean I guess this proves where she is
[03:32:28] but I feel like she chucked they chucked
[03:32:30] her into oh he chucked her into event
[03:32:33] [ __ ] I knew okay okay I knew it I knew
[03:32:35] it wait the last one they literally
[03:32:36] chucked her into event it would have
[03:32:37] been it's literally an event they
[03:32:39] chucked her event
[03:32:43] for both people
[03:32:46] 's clothing
[03:32:48] and then this one's the event it's been
[03:32:50] tough for both people to fit no no it's
[03:32:53] the sound may have come from a class
[03:32:54] yeah that goes there
[03:32:58] what there was a okay but I knew it it
[03:33:00] was the best I told
[03:33:06] no one entered or left wait house okay
[03:33:09] I'm opening shot again yo okay I got
[03:33:11] most of them though I actually got most
[03:33:13] of them this is actually stupid though
[03:33:15] how okay okay okay okay okay okay
[03:33:18] if this this clue says hey no one left
[03:33:22] why the [ __ ] would the answer to where
[03:33:24] did Halsey go be no one left wow good
[03:33:28] [ __ ] answer I literally said they
[03:33:30] [ __ ] stuffed her in the van which is
[03:33:32] probably gonna be the correct answer I
[03:33:34] game baited me game baited me that
[03:33:36] wasn't my fault
[03:33:44] there's no answer
[03:33:48] so I was right
[03:33:55] I literally was right
[03:34:00] wait she's in the audience
[03:34:04] trouble figuring things out
[03:34:07] she's either in the audience or they
[03:34:09] stopped her into a van I think if I'm
[03:34:11] the criminal you suffer an event you
[03:34:13] wait for them to leave you put her in
[03:34:14] there GG what the [ __ ] is she gonna do
[03:34:16] in-game in-game in-game
[03:34:19] look
[03:34:20] since we're at a dead end why not
[03:34:22] consider a different track
[03:34:25] just like the trick is it transpired the
[03:34:28] end result must have been bad ending
[03:34:30] what the [ __ ] are you talking about
[03:34:33] if only we knew how Halsey disappeared
[03:34:38] [Music]
[03:34:44] well that's a real live person disappear
[03:34:47] you know like you did from that one
[03:34:49] she's still here if no one left she's
[03:34:51] probably in the [ __ ] audience
[03:34:55] could it have been the water
[03:34:57] accuse my Interruption dear opponents
[03:34:59] but do you not see oh yeah there is
[03:35:02] actually a lot of clues that we didn't
[03:35:03] use we didn't use the vase we didn't use
[03:35:05] the
[03:35:07] vase awkward delay in the performance
[03:35:15] if the defense is unable to make further
[03:35:18] effective arguments we will move on to
[03:35:20] the next stage of the trial no no I have
[03:35:21] I can make something objection
[03:35:26] at that moment
[03:35:28] which gave our criminal ample time
[03:35:32] sound we heard may have come from a
[03:35:34] clash between the missing okay I
[03:35:36] literally said all this the deceased
[03:35:37] name is I literally said all this
[03:35:40] oh oh let's just not give them the
[03:35:43] correct clue so he looks like an idiot
[03:35:44] in front of his chat and everyone makes
[03:35:45] fun of him oh now the correct Blue's
[03:35:47] here and I even said we didn't use the
[03:35:49] vase and how it chose the vase oh who
[03:35:51] would have [ __ ] thunk it who would
[03:35:53] have [ __ ] thunk it
[03:35:54] it was
[03:35:56] hover important
[03:36:03] I'm pissed
[03:36:16] Lynette escaped from the water tank
[03:36:18] Vanishing gradually and leaving only
[03:36:20] clothes behind
[03:36:23] why does not say chat GPT lawyer what
[03:36:25] does that even mean
[03:36:26] [Music]
[03:36:32] [Laughter]
[03:36:35] Mona Dash it was Mona
[03:36:41] [Music]
[03:36:46] no this is reality we're talking about
[03:36:49] here objection Farina I would like to
[03:36:52] introduce you to Mona and ayaka
[03:36:58] well I rolled over my headset again all
[03:37:00] right
[03:37:03] I love farina's laugh yeah it's actually
[03:37:04] pretty good
[03:37:07] sorry I request to examine Cowell's
[03:37:09] personal effects we might find something
[03:37:10] there
[03:37:11] must we really
[03:37:14] think that of anyone your friend Lenny
[03:37:17] already knows this truth are they okay
[03:37:19] this is bad writing I like Frida but I
[03:37:21] feel like she's kind of like silly and
[03:37:23] likes being entertained by like a good
[03:37:24] trial in the sense of like she just gets
[03:37:27] off on it like the thrill so she should
[03:37:28] be like happy that it's like the plot
[03:37:31] thickens and then it goes longer she
[03:37:32] shouldn't be like do we really have to
[03:37:33] go over it so this line should be
[03:37:35] Rewritten true
[03:37:41] but halsey's disappearance is very real
[03:37:44] she wants to win yeah I know but I think
[03:37:46] maybe this is just me projecting what I
[03:37:48] wish Farina was I feel like she should
[03:37:50] be like
[03:37:51] the Crazy Character that's like I just
[03:37:53] want to see a cool trial but I I guess
[03:37:55] she just has the ego and wants to win so
[03:37:57] fair enough
[03:38:00] milkmaid no LS donated five dollars diet
[03:38:04] caffeine free fiscal
[03:38:08] caffeine free fish oil she definitely
[03:38:10] has more caffeine than official even so
[03:38:13] I trust the Traveler's judgment
[03:38:16] the truth must be out there somewhere
[03:38:19] perhaps some new line of reasoning may
[03:38:21] open if we try to gather all the focal
[03:38:23] points that don't make sense
[03:38:25] Cal was the deceased we haven't placed
[03:38:28] much attention on him
[03:38:30] but given that we aren't making much
[03:38:31] progress with the case it wouldn't hurt
[03:38:33] to have a look at his belongings oh was
[03:38:35] the [ __ ] line that they drew on the
[03:38:37] ground his body am I stupid did they did
[03:38:39] they actually show it and I missed it
[03:38:40] why have I not seen his physical body
[03:38:45] is it just because it's like a
[03:38:46] children's game and they don't want to
[03:38:47] put
[03:38:48] they did what oh it was in the cutscene
[03:38:51] well I guess I just haven't [ __ ] I
[03:38:53] don't know maybe I just wasn't looking
[03:38:54] or something I was like why did I see
[03:38:56] his physical [ __ ] body they moved the
[03:38:59] body and Drew a Chalk Outline okay okay
[03:39:00] I see fair enough
[03:39:02] [Music]
[03:39:04] the way I see it your suggestion that we
[03:39:07] brought in the scope of our
[03:39:09] investigation is nothing but a tactic
[03:39:11] for stalling the trial nevertheless I
[03:39:15] believe that this is a reasonable
[03:39:16] request on the part of an attorney
[03:39:18] since the trial does indeed appear to be
[03:39:20] at an impasse I believe that additional
[03:39:22] evidence may help us make more progress
[03:39:25] guards please step into the lounge and
[03:39:27] examine the personal effects of this
[03:39:32] who spells guard like that
[03:39:34] we are still examining the items but we
[03:39:37] have already made critical progress
[03:39:40] whole taste we discovered several test
[03:39:43] tubes
[03:39:45] each labeled separately
[03:39:50] claims that these fluids are
[03:39:53] water from the primordial sea the
[03:39:57] primordial sea the notes contents also
[03:40:00] indicate that cow belong to an
[03:40:02] organization that sells illegal drugs
[03:40:03] and that he had an accomplice wow the
[03:40:07] notebook has many entries concerning
[03:40:08] safe usage of these fluids in which the
[03:40:11] keyword dissolve appears many times
[03:40:15] one of these tubes was labeled Opera
[03:40:17] epicles along with yesterday's date
[03:40:20] it is empty the notes also state that
[03:40:23] these dissolution properties work
[03:40:25] exclusively on people from Fontaine wait
[03:40:27] he just solved her that Halsey was
[03:40:29] chosen as some sort of test subject
[03:40:33] not a test subject and then you kill
[03:40:35] them
[03:40:37] as such we believe that the defense is
[03:40:39] hypothesis yeah whatever fact supported
[03:40:42] by sufficient evidence another test
[03:40:44] subject
[03:40:46] gotta be kidding people dissolving into
[03:40:49] water could something so ridiculous
[03:40:51] actually wait a moment this reminds me
[03:40:54] of a certain prophecy but it's just a
[03:40:57] coincidence isn't it huh
[03:40:59] can become water
[03:41:04] Saints
[03:41:05] and if Cowell was targeting that girl
[03:41:09] wait just a minute could that mean
[03:41:13] you do with me quick
[03:41:15] the Moselle wait what about your
[03:41:17] partners
[03:41:19] let's go just trust me
[03:41:22] huh order oh my
[03:41:26] it is undeniable that further example
[03:41:28] the deceased's personal effects has
[03:41:31] yielded some surprising results but we
[03:41:33] cannot yet that is pretty large
[03:41:37] still let us assume that these Clues are
[03:41:39] indeed authentic albeit with the
[03:41:41] understanding that Ms Halsey has yet to
[03:41:43] be found guards please continue
[03:41:46] examining the items along these lines yo
[03:41:48] [ __ ] you whoever said this looks like
[03:41:49] coils [ __ ] you you ruined it for me Mr
[03:41:51] Vinnie it appears your hypothesis is
[03:41:53] supported by the evidence so please
[03:41:55] continue speaking
[03:41:57] of course thank you your honor
[03:42:01] yep let me feel sometimes I believe that
[03:42:04] many of these cases seemingly unrelated
[03:42:06] Clues can be connected together
[03:42:15] that water from the primordial sea oh
[03:42:19] primordial Jade Wing spear it's ciao
[03:42:23] who's the Prime Suspect this
[03:42:24] [ __ ] bro we know why you asking
[03:42:27] me again
[03:42:29] what I under the culture to use the
[03:42:31] timing
[03:42:39] yeah probably the [ __ ] hook right he
[03:42:42] roadhog hooked it
[03:42:46] man I miss when OverWatch was good I was
[03:42:48] actually dude I was the best hooker like
[03:42:50] roadhogs what item did the culprit use
[03:42:52] to dissolve Haley this [ __ ] water
[03:42:53] from the Jade spear what I know the
[03:42:55] companies to hide the mechanic mechanism
[03:42:58] uh uh no not a rope if you didn't use
[03:43:00] Rob to hide anything
[03:43:02] oh was it the hook
[03:43:04] wait let me read again
[03:43:08] magic trick but was instead now it seems
[03:43:11] like the hook rope was not meant the
[03:43:14] rope that strung the water maybe the
[03:43:16] Rope is here and then hook his other one
[03:43:17] hook for like the the hide thing wait
[03:43:21] what is this that was in the magic box
[03:43:22] on stage the entire time oh wait they
[03:43:25] use the water the water though
[03:43:29] the water box
[03:43:33] the entire time no but where's the water
[03:43:35] one
[03:43:41] wait I'm no longer cooking anymore
[03:43:48] I am no longer cooking he used water to
[03:43:50] hide it
[03:43:52] like a vase but there's no [ __ ] vase
[03:43:54] here
[03:43:57] when that was in the magical I remember
[03:43:59] there was some oh Jesus I guess no no no
[03:44:02] I was going to roll I swear I knew it I
[03:44:05] was gonna put the hook I actually got it
[03:44:06] I just I thought I could I didn't think
[03:44:08] that would lock in I thought I could
[03:44:09] change I literally knew it first try I
[03:44:11] was gonna go I wanted to put that there
[03:44:13] and then go back to the other one and
[03:44:14] put the hook I was just testing I
[03:44:16] literally got it
[03:44:18] I got it first try I got it first try
[03:44:22] what the [ __ ] was that sound
[03:44:24] boom
[03:44:25] okay buy one
[03:44:31] Powell would tamper with the water tank
[03:44:33] rope and the number the number selector
[03:44:35] securing his Target when the magic box
[03:44:39] containing Halsey would slower the metal
[03:44:41] hook would retract gradually and Pierce
[03:44:44] the balloon at the top of the box
[03:44:50] when the balloon attached to the Box
[03:44:52] popped popped the water from the
[03:44:54] primordial seed inside it would pour
[03:44:57] down and dissolve Halsey
[03:45:01] afterward Cowell would enter the tunnel
[03:45:04] and break the flower base to conceal the
[03:45:06] water inside the tunnel with the
[03:45:09] remaining evidence being covered up by
[03:45:11] the water tank on stage
[03:45:14] but but he encountered something
[03:45:17] unexpected in the tunnel and wound up
[03:45:20] being failed failed by the city
[03:45:26] huh well that actually links together a
[03:45:30] lot of them were confusing pieces of
[03:45:31] evidence
[03:45:34] how's it 50 50 after that
[03:45:38] you even I think they sound convincing
[03:45:41] now
[03:45:42] have I falsely accused an innocent
[03:45:44] person
[03:45:45] I have a question I have a question
[03:45:49] no disrespect you're great but if you're
[03:45:51] the archon of Justice right okay hear me
[03:45:52] out if you're the arcade of Justice
[03:45:53] right sure you care more about like
[03:45:55] justice than being correct so can you be
[03:45:57] like that sounds convincing I'm on your
[03:45:59] true no it seems like the only point of
[03:46:02] contention remaining is exact
[03:46:04] circumstances
[03:46:07] deleted Holes
[03:46:09] his notes mentioned he had an accomplice
[03:46:12] who could be related to the situation
[03:46:14] it's not how lawyers work yeah but
[03:46:18] the archon of Justice shouldn't be a
[03:46:21] lawyer
[03:46:22] you should be trying to deliver Justice
[03:46:24] not trying to represent your client do
[03:46:26] you know what a lawyer does you try to
[03:46:27] give your client the fairer the fairest
[03:46:29] uh uh like the fairest interpretation of
[03:46:33] the law type of thing is this what you
[03:46:35] want you're not trying to [ __ ] if
[03:46:37] your client comes with you says I killed
[03:46:39] this person you can't just go in court
[03:46:40] and be like yeah he didn't kill anyone
[03:46:45] or like if you're just like okay
[03:46:47] whatever dude she's not okay but listen
[03:46:49] she's not
[03:46:58] I mean okay there's ways to go around it
[03:47:00] like you kind of can but like you should
[03:47:02] like there's ways that it's more
[03:47:03] detailed than that but the point is if
[03:47:05] you're gonna be like the the symbol of
[03:47:07] Justice it's more nive yet than a lawyer
[03:47:10] if you're a lawyer it's not like
[03:47:13] you're gonna take your clients [ __ ]
[03:47:15] best interest in mind
[03:47:17] whatever it's fine on back note the
[03:47:19] guards have just silly and goofy
[03:47:21] indicating that they uncovered new
[03:47:22] evidence I shall now invite him on stage
[03:47:25] to share it with us
[03:47:29] thank you your honor we were just
[03:47:31] inspecting the luggage of the other
[03:47:33] people involved in this case
[03:47:35] and we found an identical sample of the
[03:47:37] water from the primordial sea among
[03:47:39] Lenny's personal effects
[03:47:41] what wait they forged it it can't be
[03:47:45] [Music]
[03:47:47] I see well how wonderfully comedic to
[03:47:52] have your own counter-attack only to
[03:47:55] come back and wound you the train is
[03:47:57] insane she's actually insane not clear
[03:48:00] all doubt
[03:48:01] my dear citizens
[03:48:07] but I do appreciate the subs thanks a
[03:48:09] lot CJ Jason Ellie [ __ ] hello
[03:48:15] what
[03:48:22] he did leave the scene via the vent okay
[03:48:24] true
[03:48:27] modification
[03:48:34] the water from the primordial sea
[03:48:38] okay Cowell did do that
[03:48:46] and prepare to do away with his partner
[03:48:48] I don't know about that one
[03:48:51] I don't want Lenny you know
[03:48:53] ultimately
[03:48:54] out and the tool meant to cover the
[03:48:57] crime up dude look how Lenny's built
[03:48:59] this guy is like [ __ ] 90 90 pounds at
[03:49:03] most
[03:49:04] 90 pounds he can't knock anyone out he
[03:49:06] doesn't have his pyro vision
[03:49:09] no as much as I regret having come to
[03:49:12] such a viciously straightforward
[03:49:14] conclusion it does seem that the fame
[03:49:17] fatoui is quite the cold-blooded and
[03:49:20] ruthless organization
[03:49:24] am I right Mr Lenny we've used up all
[03:49:29] the evidence we collected there's no way
[03:49:31] for us to make a rebuttal here is this
[03:49:34] the end of the road
[03:49:37] Matt do we just lose Quest over
[03:49:42] oh we actually just imagine
[03:49:47] we've all seen enough now and we have
[03:49:50] ample witnesses to my Flawless reasoning
[03:49:53] I believe this is indeed the finale
[03:50:00] wait it was missing a DOT we're not done
[03:50:11] no Miss I know her do not to shout she
[03:50:15] made me uh some sweets we ate them

[03:50:21] reason for interrupting you know now
[03:50:23] would anyone here like to take a little
[03:50:25] break from all this debate and see a
[03:50:28] little magic I'll show you an amazing
[03:50:30] trick one that can bring a young woman
[03:50:32] who has disappeared back in wait a
[03:50:35] second right right for your very eyes
[03:50:39] the honors Mr Linney
[03:50:42] what what what in the world is she
[03:50:44] saying no offense Miss but Miracles like
[03:50:47] that are beyond my scope oh just roll
[03:50:49] with it she's clearly setting you up
[03:50:51] don't be silly
[03:50:55] it often conceals the truth while
[03:50:57] presenting a fascinating illusion
[03:51:00] but once everyone believes the illusion
[03:51:02] can't magic reveal the truth to them
[03:51:04] once again true
[03:51:07] such a trick be the most marvelous
[03:51:10] finale to today's performance true

[03:52:46] also I just got a fishing level so
[03:52:48] please type progress for me thank you
[03:52:49] chat I'm the one who killed Cowell I
[03:52:52] admit it
[03:52:54] no what
[03:52:58] firstly my name isn't Halsey it's
[03:53:01] Lillian Lillian originally from monstat
[03:53:04] what I heard that Lenny's show was gonna
[03:53:06] be a real Thriller but I missed the
[03:53:08] chance to buy a ticket so I stole one
[03:53:11] wait but didn't the okay they're
[03:53:13] probably gonna explain it like two
[03:53:14] sentences but then the dude just say the
[03:53:16] the [ __ ] dissolve only works on
[03:53:17] Fontaine blood people or whatever
[03:53:19] that's how I make a living I still
[03:53:21] sausage maybe that's why she's still
[03:53:23] here friends I'd never been caught for
[03:53:25] that's why she's not dead
[03:53:27] with Harbor a few days ago it is chamber
[03:53:29] and harbor
[03:53:31] two dollar in agents yeah what's next
[03:53:34] I'll shut up that was cringe I'm sorry
[03:53:43] [Music]
[03:53:45] I literally said it was the thief
[03:53:48] wait okay I'm actually like I dude I'm
[03:53:50] I'm like
[03:53:53] well and I thought that would have been
[03:53:55] the end of it but then the number
[03:53:57] selector chose me
[03:54:01] he even mentioned the Fortress of
[03:54:03] maripede that's a prison isn't it so you
[03:54:06] can imagine how shocked I was I thought
[03:54:08] he was on to me for sure
[03:54:09] so I played along with the show while
[03:54:11] looking for an opening to flee but then
[03:54:14] I got water poured on me for no reason
[03:54:15] and then someone jumped into the tunnel
[03:54:17] to NAB me okay so she didn't she hid
[03:54:19] outside and said to like saying anything
[03:54:21] and she thieved an innocent civilian I
[03:54:23] still think I still agree with my
[03:54:25] initial take [ __ ] this person
[03:54:31] okay that's pretty base though yeah
[03:54:32] where to run from there though so I had
[03:54:34] to never mind now I'm back to neutral on
[03:54:36] her
[03:54:38] [Music]
[03:54:45] box can a person even hide in these
[03:54:49] professional Thief could make it work
[03:54:50] could I swear I didn't know that the
[03:54:52] water tank would fall down
[03:54:55] um like I got [ __ ] finessed I
[03:54:57] wouldn't have put him in the magic box I
[03:55:00] may be a thief but I'm no killer well
[03:55:02] that makes everything pretty clear now
[03:55:05] definite
[03:55:07] this time we need to tell the entire
[03:55:10] story from wait why Shirley Farina
[03:55:12] doesn't disagree with us now oh she
[03:55:14] [ __ ] heard she just heard the witness
[03:55:19] this was true I'm pretty sure this is
[03:55:20] the one that wasn't
[03:55:23] um
[03:55:24] wait what did that say Cole plant either
[03:55:28] [Music]
[03:55:36] wait okay wait what is this
[03:55:38] um I infrared between Lenny and Cowell
[03:55:41] put the music on okay true
[03:55:45] uh uh what is that one called it's when
[03:55:48] you make the final
[03:55:50] argument OST
[03:55:58] no not that one where is it
[03:56:03] did I hear the song in my [ __ ] dreams
[03:56:05] because I fell asleep with my switch on
[03:56:06] listening to this so now it's been stuck
[03:56:08] in my head all right anyways
[03:56:11] all right invite between Lenny and
[03:56:14] Cowell
[03:56:17] uh Lenny wants to get credit and glory
[03:56:19] to get rid of us partners uh as a house
[03:56:21] see as if you're completely unharmed
[03:56:23] free this conjecture no longer holds
[03:56:25] water but there's evidence proving that
[03:56:26] a fight did indeed break out
[03:56:28] yes there was because of this
[03:56:35] right yep
[03:56:40] during the struggle between Lillian and
[03:56:43] Cowell
[03:56:44] Lenny knocked out Cowell Noble it was
[03:56:47] the girl whatever her [ __ ] name is uh
[03:56:50] um
[03:56:52] but there's no [ __ ] way to prove it
[03:56:54] though maybe the clothes why would she
[03:56:56] take her clothes off I remember I
[03:56:58] Maybe
[03:57:01] oh yeah should be afraid it should be
[03:57:03] recognized okay although he just didn't
[03:57:05] listen when she was talking all good
[03:57:06] just what one might expect of an
[03:57:08] experience be this is so many lumine
[03:57:11] voice lines dude we like never get to
[03:57:12] hear a talk
[03:57:23] Howard Halsey have reject reacted when
[03:57:26] the water from the sea
[03:57:28] well she's from monstat how do I say
[03:57:30] that

[03:57:43] but maybe it's this one uh no but this
[03:57:45] is true this is true the thing did fall
[03:57:52] he did use the vent
[03:57:55] wait let's see let's see let's read
[03:57:56] let's read
[03:58:05] oh maybe the thumb wait wait what did it
[03:58:07] say how would Halsey have reacted when
[03:58:09] the water began to tickle in
[03:58:30] there was a
[03:58:46] it's one of these two I don't really
[03:58:48] know why though so I can understood a
[03:58:50] review how's he dissolved oh there's a
[03:58:51] thumb because they fought true yup she
[03:58:53] punched it she [ __ ] punched his ass
[03:58:55] true true LW true LW easy
[03:59:00] true
[03:59:02] Lillian
[03:59:06] she picnicked
[03:59:14] Cowell lift into the tunnel only to
[03:59:17] discover that Lillian had
[03:59:20] she did not know that Lillian was not
[03:59:22] from Fontaine but was a thief who made
[03:59:26] her way in by stealing a ticket
[03:59:29] mistakenly believing that the water from
[03:59:31] the primordial sea needed time to take
[03:59:34] effect he tried
[03:59:36] Lillian back into the box the two broke
[03:59:39] the flower vase during the struggle but
[03:59:42] Lillian you got your weakest monster
[03:59:44] civilian
[03:59:46] true no way of escaping she changed her
[03:59:50] clothes and hid in the costume trunk
[03:59:52] until the performance ended
[04:00:12] I was shouting my bed
[04:00:20] so I already run an ad okay but I can't
[04:00:22] do that right now
[04:00:35] she had already become desperately
[04:00:37] hungry by the time we were chatting over
[04:00:39] macarons so she swiped two of them right
[04:00:42] under our noses okay
[04:00:45] sneaky Thief
[04:00:48] came out like okay that actually doesn't
[04:00:50] make sense why the F okay I mean
[04:00:52] whatever
[04:00:53] what
[04:00:55] [Music]
[04:00:59] also macarons aren't even filling what
[04:01:01] okay whatever
[04:01:11] now then lady Farina do you wish to
[04:01:15] speak against the defensive statements
[04:01:20] please answer the question lady Farina
[04:01:24] also if I may add the trial has not yet
[04:01:26] Ended as such I request that the
[04:01:29] prosecution not leave the room before
[04:01:31] the proceedings have included
[04:01:36] what are you reading my mind now holy
[04:01:40] no what a [ __ ] Chad further argument
[04:01:45] S I admit defeat
[04:01:47] but really could you at least have left
[04:01:49] me with some dignity
[04:01:51] no
[04:01:53] if there are no objections then as the
[04:01:56] chief what a [ __ ] Chad I shall once
[04:01:58] again repeat the full sequence of events
[04:02:00] okay
[04:02:01] thank God I got to hear him saying that
[04:02:03] [ __ ] Primal disappearances Carol
[04:02:05] selected his next victim from the
[04:02:07] audience reservation list with some
[04:02:10] modifications to the selector he could
[04:02:12] ensure that the pre-selected young woman
[04:02:14] would be chosen to cover up any evidence
[04:02:17] while committing the deed Cowell thought
[04:02:19] of allowing the water tank to fall which
[04:02:21] would conceal the water left behind
[04:02:23] after the young woman was dissolved he
[04:02:26] also tempered with the Rope suspending
[04:02:28] the water tank using the fireworks at
[04:02:30] the end of the performance to cause the
[04:02:32] tank to drop and hide the watermarks he
[04:02:35] poured the water from the primordial sea
[04:02:37] into a balloon during the preparation of
[04:02:39] a magic box and stuck it to the Box's
[04:02:42] lid
[04:02:43] finally he passed the prepared hook on a
[04:02:45] rope through the Gap in the magic Box's
[04:02:47] door when bringing the young woman to
[04:02:49] said box when the magic trick officially
[04:02:52] began the Box containing the woman was
[04:02:55] lowered into the tunnel tightening the
[04:02:57] hook rope and bursting the balloon
[04:02:59] containing the water
[04:03:00] if all had gone to plan the young woman
[04:03:03] would be dissolved at this time however
[04:03:05] Liliane was not from Fontaine and thus
[04:03:08] fled the box with a loud noise
[04:03:11] realizing that there was trouble Cowell
[04:03:13] entered the tunnel and met Liliane
[04:03:15] thinking that the waters had not yet
[04:03:17] taken effect he decided to proceed
[04:03:21] however his opponent was more capable
[04:03:22] than he thought um what a [ __ ] Chad
[04:03:24] not unconscious and placed into the
[04:03:27] magic box and thus became his own final
[04:03:30] victim Lillian according to her own
[04:03:33] statements then changed clothes and hid
[04:03:35] until the performance ended before
[04:03:37] hiding in other parts of the Opera House
[04:03:41] as for Lenny he was in the underground
[04:03:44] structures within the opera house yeah
[04:03:46] he was an event he didn't know he's
[04:03:47] happening he was venting from this
[04:03:49] reconstruction of events we can conclude
[04:03:51] that Lenny the accused is in fact
[04:03:54] innocent
[04:03:58] foreign
[04:04:01] 's conduct that should still be
[04:04:03] investigated separately
[04:04:05] this case at least can be handed over to
[04:04:08] the oratories to make the final decision
[04:04:13] [ __ ] is that also a storyal wish
[04:04:17] report
[04:04:21] it's a [ __ ] star uh astral Express
[04:04:29] as such Lenny and Lynette are officially
[04:04:32] declared not guilty thanks naviette

[04:04:50] the water from the primordial sea in
[04:04:52] Lenny's bed yeah
[04:04:54] yeah
[04:04:57] it caused me to make a serious mistake
[04:04:59] you know
[04:05:00] or was that seems like you were you
[04:05:02] placed something uh in the scene of the
[04:05:05] crime
[04:05:06] before this court that's why allegedly
[04:05:09] there are some allegedly free criminals
[04:05:11] allegedly from a famous case allegedly
[04:05:13] because there was allegedly a glove
[04:05:15] placed allegedly despite everyone
[04:05:17] allegedly knowing allegedly
[04:05:22] I'm sure you know what you must do to
[04:05:24] lessen your sentence
[04:05:32] I I was just following orders
[04:05:35] we were supposed to place blame for the
[04:05:37] serial disappearances on to Lenny and
[04:05:39] thus caused suspicion to fall on the
[04:05:41] fatoui the higher-ups said this was the
[04:05:44] best opportunity to do so and now that
[04:05:46] your plan has fallen through and the
[04:05:48] secrets of the water have been removed
[04:05:50] we just saw you earlier you just said
[04:05:52] higher ups yes
[04:05:54] therefore you would be wise to tell
[04:05:56] everything you know and seek the
[04:05:58] protection of the Gods
[04:06:04] discovered that the water can cause
[04:06:06] people to dissolve
[04:06:08] it can also be made into a potion which
[04:06:11] when extremely diluted can cause people
[04:06:13] to experience Unforgettable corrupt High
[04:06:16] Reps like IRL been in this business for
[04:06:18] a while now and have made decent more
[04:06:20] off it
[04:06:22] I mean
[04:06:25] we're talking about the
[04:06:35] what the [ __ ]
[04:06:41] such ruthlessness
[04:06:45] I shouldn't have expected any less I
[04:06:46] mean deserve an outrageous Act
[04:06:49] all present please submit to inspection
[04:06:51] immediately wait a second
[04:06:54] how do you know the higher-ups of the
[04:06:55] [ __ ] guards aren't you literally the
[04:06:57] archon and the Chief Justice

[04:07:22] is dissolving them listen I have seen
[04:07:24] this picture many times
[04:07:26] what do you think this vial is hmm
[04:07:30] what if it dissolves people

[04:07:54] right now maybe you don't even want to
[04:07:56] look at me
[04:07:57] but still
[04:07:59] let me thank you again for defending me
[04:08:01] to the end
[04:08:02] even after you learned that I'm a member
[04:08:04] of the fatoui
[04:08:06] I guess
[04:08:08] but regardless I'd like the opportunity
[04:08:10] yeah that means [ __ ] pissed I didn't
[04:08:12] approach he's [ __ ] angry dude I'm so
[04:08:14] ill intent
[04:08:16] I've spoken to you as myself
[04:08:18] plain Lenny this entire time okay this
[04:08:21] guy's actually the rizzler dude this is
[04:08:22] literally a child too as for why I'm a
[04:08:24] fetus it's because the goals of the
[04:08:27] House of the Hearth align with those of
[04:08:29] an orphan like me
[04:08:30] that's all that was how father who you
[04:08:33] might know wait that's who father is
[04:08:36] recruiting us back the Nave wait no
[04:08:38] isn't the neighbor like you know wait a
[04:08:39] second who the [ __ ] is the name
[04:08:41] there's an article yeah it is early you
[04:08:43] know okay it is
[04:08:46] wait they call wait arloquino is father
[04:09:00] the one who controls the flush
[04:09:04] she's your father
[04:09:09] that's right and since we're here that
[04:09:13] means father in Russian oh I see would
[04:09:15] you mind hearing
[04:09:17] it's about my past back when our parents
[04:09:19] first died
[04:09:20] Lynette and I were left wandering the
[04:09:22] streets
[04:09:23] survive I took to surreptitiously
[04:09:26] observing an older street performer dude
[04:09:28] they do not give a [ __ ] about [ __ ]
[04:09:30] freminate huh he never talks about him
[04:09:31] pulled off his amazing tricks
[04:09:35] okay
[04:09:37] I took my sister through several streets
[04:09:39] until we found a crowded corner and we
[04:09:42] began to perform magic tricks there to
[04:09:44] my surprise they proved to be pretty
[04:09:47] popular and we could at least stop
[04:09:49] worrying about where our next meal would
[04:09:50] come from for a Time
[04:09:52] but I didn't want my sister to remain a
[04:09:55] street rat together with me forever
[04:09:57] monka W along and Aristocrat came to me
[04:10:00] and claimed that he wished to take us in
[04:10:02] after watching my performances
[04:10:04] so you went from orphans to nobility
[04:10:07] just like that that was how we felt at
[04:10:09] first too
[04:10:11] as if fate was on our side and we could
[04:10:13] say goodbye to those painful days
[04:10:16] but I gradually discovered that while we
[04:10:18] were called foster children he was
[04:10:21] really after my talent for magic tricks
[04:10:23] okay constantly take me to all sorts of
[04:10:26] Banquets to Garner attention which he
[04:10:29] would then use to expand his Social
[04:10:30] Circles that doesn't seem too bad either
[04:10:34] than roaming the streets at any rate but
[04:10:37] then he
[04:10:40] took a while for me to realize just how
[04:10:43] to tell us oh after one particular
[04:10:45] performance at a banquet
[04:10:47] I discovered that Lynette was not on the
[04:10:50] same return vehicle as me
[04:10:52] I waited a long time after we returned
[04:10:54] home but she did not come back
[04:10:57] I went to that Noble's bedroom and asked
[04:10:59] him about her whereabouts uh-oh the
[04:11:02] answer he gave me was
[04:11:04] she caught the eye of the most eminent
[04:11:06] person at the banquet so I sent her over
[04:11:08] as a gift
[04:11:09] I mean you'll be able to perform your
[04:11:11] magic regardless of who your assistant
[04:11:13] is yes and then let me kill them
[04:11:16] so he was gonna
[04:11:17] huh but what if fontaine's laws deal
[04:11:21] with such people
[04:11:22] as far as Outsiders are concerned this
[04:11:25] is a relationship akin to adoption or
[04:11:27] foster care
[04:11:28] and they have their ways of escaping the
[04:11:30] eye of the law
[04:11:34] n that's what I'm after that I managed
[04:11:37] to ferret out the location of the
[04:11:39] Mansion of that so-called eminent person
[04:11:41] and hurried through the night
[04:11:43] but by the time I leaped over the walls
[04:11:45] afforded the guards and made my way in
[04:11:48] all I saw was the Moonlight ground
[04:11:50] covered in blood
[04:11:53] and the knave standing there I okay this
[04:11:56] game tells me they always there has to
[04:11:59] be okay every time it's yeah this
[04:12:01] villain did nothing wrong see now our
[04:12:02] like he knows a good guy I I'm all for
[04:12:05] it that means she's playable okay true
[04:12:06] thanks now we have our lakino deserved
[04:12:09] deserved deserved that guy had it coming
[04:12:13] I'm sorry
[04:12:14] are like you know [ __ ] deserved so
[04:12:17] she'd already taken care of that guy
[04:12:20] that's right
[04:12:22] she had rescued my sister before she
[04:12:23] could come to any harm and had even
[04:12:25] discovered several girls hidden in a
[04:12:27] basement all of them orphans
[04:12:30] huh father I mean the knave might have
[04:12:35] seen something in me and so she made me
[04:12:37] an offer
[04:12:40] The House of the Hearth welcomes you for
[04:12:42] your interests align with ours
[04:12:45] here none will ever betray you
[04:12:48] indeed betrayal shall never be permitted
[04:12:51] here wait I was also right trust her
[04:12:54] I mean I had just been betrayed by okay
[04:12:56] not to make this about me but I was also
[04:12:58] right about Charlotte's [ __ ] case
[04:13:00] that she was looking after being
[04:13:02] literally Lenny Lynette like they're a
[04:13:04] little it was literally okay anyways
[04:13:06] that's [ __ ] up but she was also quick
[04:13:08] to destroy the noble who had taken us in
[04:13:10] at first giving us back our freedom it
[04:13:13] isn't wait aren't they looking after
[04:13:16] oh I guess it was 20 years ago okay
[04:13:18] never mind I guess it's not the same
[04:13:21] damn
[04:13:24] oh
[04:13:29] the knave isn't after the gnosis is wait
[04:13:31] is after the gnosis isn't she
[04:13:33] [Music]
[04:13:34] it's her own plants
[04:13:36] she has gained permission from the
[04:13:38] Sarita to first use the gnosis
[04:13:42] to find a way to break the prophecy and
[04:13:45] save Fontaine
[04:13:49] not
[04:13:50] let someone else whatever
[04:13:52] close enough
[04:13:54] that's right the whole house of the
[04:13:56] Hearth is currently working to combat
[04:13:58] that correct today's case has also
[04:14:00] proven that people from Fontaine can
[04:14:01] indeed dissolve into some sort of water
[04:14:03] thus further supporting the prophecy
[04:14:08] all of us house members here lady
[04:14:10] arlikino herself included are from
[04:14:12] Fontaine We Won't Give Up on defending
[04:14:15] our homeland
[04:14:17] to us orphans the only connection we
[04:14:19] have left to this world apart from our
[04:14:22] family is our homeland
[04:14:25] okay fun small dudes like Distributing I
[04:14:28] mean that makes sense
[04:14:30] like feeling a gnosis everything is
[04:14:33] aimed at dealing with that prophecy
[04:14:37] it's all right I understand
[04:14:40] the only thing I can do is relate all
[04:14:42] this to you
[04:14:43] I just hope you can understand that even
[04:14:45] as a member of the house I have never
[04:14:48] stopped making my own decisions and that
[04:14:50] I believe what I'm doing is right if you
[04:14:53] should need anything at all in the
[04:14:54] future feel free to find me
[04:14:57] I will do my best to help you
[04:15:00] plain Lenny
[04:15:05] okay
[04:15:10] um
[04:15:16] uh I don't know how I feel about what I
[04:15:18] just learned but okay
[04:15:27] I mean based our lakino I guess
[04:15:31] hey there
[04:15:33] what was with the disappearing act you
[04:15:34] pulled right as the trial ended were you
[04:15:37] looking for us
[04:15:39] well this whole thing isn't exactly over
[04:15:42] is it I do feel that we're getting
[04:15:45] closer to solving the serial
[04:15:46] disappearances case though huh
[04:15:49] what's wrong my dear partner
[04:15:54] [Music]
[04:15:56] the ones have been crack a case it's
[04:15:58] been cold for decades now
[04:16:00] and given that there's new evidence from
[04:16:03] The Trial
[04:16:05] of breadcrumbs for the hydro archons
[04:16:07] people to follow now
[04:16:10] there's one good thing immediately a
[04:16:12] good guy I mean I'm sure like you know
[04:16:13] so [ __ ] evil but at least you say at
[04:16:15] least she killed that dude
[04:16:18] I can fix her maybe I don't know we'll
[04:16:21] see what we'll see we'll see what
[04:16:22] happens in act two but I could probably
[04:16:24] fix her
[04:16:25] might have been too presumptuous
[04:16:28] say that Nadia oh and we were having so
[04:16:31] much fun investigating with you too
[04:16:35] having new Waters flowing into a
[04:16:37] stagnant mire causing New Hope to Spring
[04:16:40] forth and the reflection in the Merc to
[04:16:42] become clearer well sorry about that I'm
[04:16:47] a bit prone to Nostalgia don't mind me
[04:16:49] wait shall we have a farewell meal you
[04:16:52] know to commemorate our time as partners
[04:16:55] huh
[04:16:56] do we really need to get that formal
[04:17:00] she really did treat us as partners huh
[04:17:03] well I'd just like to have a proper
[04:17:05] ending anyway it would just be a meal so
[04:17:08] it's you don't have to twist oh
[04:17:10] wonderful in that case why don't we
[04:17:12] return hi Nathan

[04:17:30] 43.50 a bit less than four how is part
[04:17:34] two okay be honest is part two longer
[04:17:36] than part one be honest please say no
[04:17:41] okay if you're saying no

[04:18:29] at least at least she killed that dude
[04:18:42] also until we see what Sarita looks like
[04:18:45] every time I see that name I'll just
[04:18:46] think of Senora I know they're not the
[04:18:48] same person I know okay but anytime I
[04:18:50] see a name and I don't associate a face
[04:18:52] to it I associate the nearest person to
[04:18:54] it I'm sorry I'm just [ __ ] stupid

[04:21:28] foreign
[04:22:06] concert I would like to but

[04:23:48] again
[04:23:53] foreign
[04:23:55] though I enjoyed it uh I don't know what
[04:23:57] I would rate it I think it was
[04:24:01] it was pretty like
[04:24:02] okay farina's kind of insane but like
[04:24:04] outside of her reasoning being kind of
[04:24:06] weird I guess it's just she doesn't want
[04:24:07] to lose I mean I enjoyed it it was fun
[04:24:10] there's a few things that I'm like
[04:24:12] question mark about but I like overall
[04:24:14] it was fun I do enjoy the investigation
[04:24:16] mechanic
[04:24:20] um
[04:24:22] I was like
[04:24:25] to me nothing still tops the
[04:24:32] I think he was most likely manipulating
[04:24:33] them I mean yeah obviously he's the
[04:24:34] [ __ ] fatui no [ __ ] the Tori just
[04:24:37] [ __ ] used scarra the whole time but
[04:24:39] like at least she killed the dude
[04:24:52] nothing comes to what nothing comes the
[04:24:54] to me the
[04:24:56] nahida like archon Quest where we like
[04:24:59] beep and then we woke up
[04:25:01] was probably my favorite
[04:25:04] I also like the archon quest that had
[04:25:06] Xiao and like Ito and [ __ ] 2.8 or
[04:25:09] whatever the [ __ ] it was I don't know
[04:25:10] three point something I don't know 2.7
[04:25:12] 3.24 217 218 whatever whichever one
[04:25:15] seven yeah that one
[04:25:25] okay shot
[04:25:27] how is act two compared to act one like
[04:25:29] lengthwise
[04:25:31] because I need to know
[04:25:34] [Music]
[04:25:38] it feels like a little bit shorter
[04:25:40] mostly the same but short is what it
[04:25:42] looks like felt shorter to me

[04:33:00] so there you go
[04:33:02] under the Asia account review vid it's
[04:33:04] being edited but uh it's like very
[04:33:07] delayed so don't worry about it but it
[04:33:08] will be out
[04:33:14] wow food
[04:33:17] s
[04:33:21] all right I'll listen I'm sorry
[04:33:31] people in Fontaine sure know how to
[04:33:33] enjoy life
[04:33:35] why of course go ahead try whatever you
[04:33:38] like if the food's good I'll make a
[04:33:40] group reservation for the rest of spina
[04:33:42] de rosula next time and if it's not no
[04:33:45] it's a baguette well well uh
[04:33:48] [Music]
[04:33:49] bring everyone also why did pyman call
[04:33:52] Subaru food burnt but she's hyper about
[04:33:54] Fontan food
[04:33:55] for coupon sure have your own way of
[04:33:57] doing things
[04:33:58] oh
[04:34:00] what this A Farewell meal but we
[04:34:02] couldn't also treat it like a victory
[04:34:04] oh true very true
[04:34:08] in that case boss another two dishes I
[04:34:12] like the way she thinks
[04:34:20] speaking of cases do you think that the
[04:34:23] Mastermind behind the serial
[04:34:25] disappearances will get caught soon now
[04:34:27] that this has all happened well we've
[04:34:30] certainly taken a big step forward but I
[04:34:33] feel that's about it we know that
[04:34:35] there's an organization that means to
[04:34:37] dissolve these young women but we still
[04:34:39] don't know what they are really after
[04:34:41] if it hadn't happened right in front of
[04:34:43] us
[04:34:44] I wouldn't have ever believed that a
[04:34:46] person could be dissolved like that
[04:34:49] right yeah it was because this was such
[04:34:53] a Preposterous notion that the
[04:34:55] investigation could never really move
[04:34:56] forward before ugh
[04:34:59] he's always I could have finished
[04:35:00] speaking
[04:35:02] in such investigations even the smallest
[04:35:05] step can seem like a yawning Chasm of
[04:35:07] the trail of Clues is cut off
[04:35:10] to be honest I don't have high hopes for
[04:35:13] any follow-up that the authorities might
[04:35:14] conduct
[04:35:16] said I don't have faith in their ability
[04:35:17] it's just that a different perspective
[04:35:20] is required in some matters
[04:35:22] it's easy to guard against and deceive a
[04:35:25] single narrow perspective a shift in
[04:35:27] thinking is required at such times in
[04:35:30] order to produce a breakthrough which is
[04:35:32] exactly why the Spina de rosule exist
[04:35:34] those highfalutin folk are not
[04:35:36] all-knowing that's why we exist to seep
[04:35:40] into the cracks where filth falls
[04:35:41] through where their watch fails them hmm
[04:35:46] and thought things were simpler it's all
[04:35:49] right
[04:35:50] hydrate I will hydrate this was supposed
[04:35:52] to be a farewell meal so I doubt you
[04:35:54] have further interest in this fist let's
[04:35:56] talk about something else
[04:35:58] like uh what are your future plans
[04:36:01] that's true
[04:36:04] I've heard that okay part one was
[04:36:07] interesting I could not give lots of a
[04:36:09] [ __ ] about this I'm sorry maybe it's
[04:36:10] just like a skill issue but you missed
[04:36:13] your chance today
[04:36:14] yeah wow there must be an organization
[04:36:17] that dissolves people okay we saw that
[04:36:19] in act one
[04:36:21] wow this food is good okay
[04:36:26] unique ways perhaps even methods of
[04:36:30] let's say questionable legality
[04:36:34] guess that's Spina de rosula's Boss For
[04:36:37] You Chuck full of sketchy ideas well one
[04:36:41] way would be to infiltrate a performance
[04:36:43] troop at the Opera House only to abandon
[04:36:45] your act at the place Climax and ask to
[04:36:47] speak to her son it gets better I'm sure
[04:36:50] lady for arena would be eager see the
[04:36:52] ending and would agree in order to
[04:36:54] finish watching the play
[04:36:57] just something a little more
[04:37:00] it's not even like it's good build up
[04:37:02] calm the [ __ ] down it's not it's just
[04:37:04] recapping random facts wake her up in
[04:37:06] the dead of night and demand answers
[04:37:08] don't let her go back I like Navia
[04:37:10] though until she answers
[04:37:12] and personally testify that this one
[04:37:14] works when I'm sleepy
[04:37:16] anything as long as I can finally get
[04:37:18] some sleep
[04:37:21] ah valid point I overlooked that part I
[04:37:26] was just thinking about leveraging a
[04:37:27] person's desire for sleep
[04:37:30] all right all right no more joking
[04:37:32] around
[04:37:33] huh
[04:37:35] you could
[04:37:37] oh I don't know cut the line when she's
[04:37:40] on a break you did defeat her in court
[04:37:42] clearing citizens of hers from false
[04:37:44] accusations
[04:37:46] false accusation she had nearly upheld
[04:37:49] personally
[04:37:50] I imagine that she feels quite ashamed
[04:37:52] about the whole thing you mean that if
[04:37:55] we catch her while she's on a break she
[04:37:57] might be too embarrassed to refuse why
[04:37:59] don't we give it a try after this meal
[04:38:01] you know strike while the iron is hot
[04:38:04] enough huh hi mon did you drink my Fanta
[04:38:07] uh was this your drink
[04:38:11] no it's fun all right

[04:38:17] finished eating then I'll go pay
[04:38:21] okay
[04:38:34] so those are important things she drank
[04:38:35] the thought that didn't like it

[04:46:39] don't know play play Pirate Play Hydro
[04:46:43] but before I do so could you explain how
[04:46:46] you managed to show up here
[04:46:48] I
[04:46:49] followed you
[04:46:51] it seemed to me that danger has followed
[04:46:53] you more closely watch you follow
[04:46:55] okay that's that's suspicious I believe
[04:47:06] and I will not betray his Trust
[04:47:10] okay do the same
[04:47:12] were he alive today
[04:47:13] do not
[04:47:15] of my father
[04:47:17] damson your father
[04:47:19] I was not strong enough
[04:47:22] but do keep an eye out for your manner
[04:47:25] of speech I believe we all wish to avoid
[04:47:28] unnecessary emotional harm
[04:47:30] sorry I
[04:47:32] did not consider your feelings okay let
[04:47:34] me pause for a second yo
[04:47:36] real talk like just between me and you
[04:47:38] why is she built like that
[04:47:42] whatever
[04:47:43] what else do you know
[04:47:45] how did you come to the conclusion that
[04:47:46] I'd be in grave Danger
[04:47:48] I doubt I know much more than you
[04:47:50] but I believe that the Mastermind behind
[04:47:52] the serial disappearances is very
[04:47:54] powerful
[04:47:55] your performance tonight will almost
[04:47:57] certainly attract their attention
[04:48:01] about me
[04:48:07] and what about these garter Macs I
[04:48:10] thought only those associated with
[04:48:12] Amazon guardianage could control them
[04:48:14] none of these Mecca have serial numbers
[04:48:16] I was sure to check a moment ago they
[04:48:19] are not the ones please please
[04:48:23] just keep in mind
[04:48:25] that every character we've seen through
[04:48:27] this Quest
[04:48:30] well at least like the important ones
[04:48:31] will be playable so so start saving your
[04:48:34] Primo gems okay ignore the rerun banners
[04:48:36] unless you want them Yo you might want
[04:48:38] wrongly you might want child you might
[04:48:39] want whoever else is next that's fine
[04:48:41] I'm just saying be smart with your Gems
[04:48:44] or you might have to use the limited
[04:48:46] five-star credit card uh to obtain them
[04:48:49] I'm just saying
[04:48:52] I can only conclude that some powerful
[04:48:55] or wealthy party must have obtained them
[04:48:57] via illegal means deploying them as a
[04:49:00] private force of sorts what she's not
[04:49:02] gonna be like Daya dude there's on the
[04:49:04] standard Banner
[04:49:05] there is no way they sounded about her
[04:49:08] and do not act rashly I would record
[04:49:10] myself eating an entire keyboard they're
[04:49:13] not gonna do that we will
[04:49:16] my father's true Last Wish
[04:49:20] regardless
[04:49:21] thank you for your help today Clarence
[04:49:24] but if you get any ideas tell me first I
[04:49:28] don't much appreciate being followed
[04:49:31] I do not think that they'll strike again
[04:49:33] anytime soon
[04:49:34] so I shall stop following you
[04:49:37] good day all no she looks too she looks
[04:49:39] too five-star for the standard Banner
[04:49:41] there I have a theory and like when I
[04:49:42] watch Like an anime or something if I
[04:49:44] see someone with like colorful hair that
[04:49:46] the camera pans on you know they're
[04:49:47] gonna be an important character always
[04:49:48] she has like that colorful purple like
[04:49:52] she's like yeah like that poor purple
[04:49:53] like fit hair hat like she has to be
[04:49:56] important
[04:49:58] they are also okay Daya did look
[04:50:00] important they kind of did her dirty she
[04:50:02] was just an exception they just but I
[04:50:04] will say yeah they're just the day of
[04:50:06] dirty there's no excuse they're just the
[04:50:07] dare dirty with that in mind if you put
[04:50:10] chlorine D and Dia and you're like which
[04:50:13] one do you think's gonna be more broken
[04:50:15] purple hair always beats any other color
[04:50:17] of hair or pink or white those are the
[04:50:19] Opie hair colors I'm sorry it just is
[04:50:21] what it is the more colorful the hair
[04:50:23] the more damage they deal
[04:50:28] but yeah they just did that dirty which
[04:50:30] I still don't forgive them for but
[04:50:45] right I suppose that's the best subject
[04:50:48] we've gotten today
[04:50:52] was being sincere with you
[04:50:56] if we tried we could attempt to Thor
[04:50:59] relations a little if we tried
[04:51:03] oh whoa whoa whoa
[04:51:05] whoa
[04:51:06] she's what
[04:51:08] was that
[04:51:10] she's what
[04:51:12] this is important
[04:51:16] she's also Champion duelist
[04:51:18] surely they don't make a champion during
[04:51:21] this not good
[04:51:24] also she's Electro
[04:51:28] dude you can just play any electric
[04:51:29] character in aggravate or hyperbloom
[04:51:33] even the bad Electro characters that
[04:51:34] were bad before dendro became okay with
[04:51:37] the exception of like Sarah became good
[04:51:41] Dory if Sarah didn't exist and you were
[04:51:44] in a funnel and you didn't have em right
[04:51:45] in and you didn't know that kustaro was
[04:51:47] a character and you also lost your
[04:51:48] official at Sea you could use Dory
[04:51:53] laughs
[04:51:57] yeah but okay yeah we don't talk about
[04:52:00] her though
[04:52:02] Dory is not a character
[04:52:13] I hope that every meal we have together
[04:52:16] shall be a victory feast
[04:52:18] as such we're still Partners there's no
[04:52:21] need to thank me
[04:52:23] stop saying my sinus bench chat he's not
[04:52:26] magnanimity
[04:52:28] if it were me I would have joined
[04:52:31] all right you two that's enough
[04:52:39] Nick that's me well to be honest you're
[04:52:43] the one who tipped us off pymon maybe
[04:52:44] it's wholesome really
[04:52:47] honey
[04:52:48] [Music]
[04:52:49] oh [ __ ] that actually [ __ ] with me
[04:52:55] broken a wholesome picture
[04:52:57] I guess Chang Ling's wholesome okay
[04:52:59] never mind I take that back I just she
[04:53:01] gave me too much like white blind looked
[04:53:04] Less in the cutscene was less like
[04:53:06] intense than chlorindi
[04:53:09] and then it was being like giving me
[04:53:10] like Amber vibes but I guess a lot of
[04:53:13] the wholesome characters like shangling
[04:53:14] and like Nikita are kind of broken so
[04:53:15] okay we'll see hopefully
[04:53:21] after we parted ways I was on the way
[04:53:24] back to one of our bases when I suddenly
[04:53:26] thought of what you said
[04:53:27] that the Fanta tasted kind of salty and
[04:53:30] icky
[04:53:32] oh that's what I missed okay I'm sorry
[04:53:35] for skipping that line but she just said
[04:53:37] it okay she said it now I know you don't
[04:53:39] have to get mad at me okay okay the font
[04:53:41] and the tasted the salty and icky what
[04:53:43] the [ __ ] okay
[04:53:45] someone [ __ ] spit in it
[04:53:48] what do you mean
[04:53:49] Fanta only comes in sweet flavor true so
[04:53:53] tasted salt
[04:53:56] Al had also been a bit off I thought it
[04:53:59] was Fanta it was actually Fonda
[04:54:04] oh like I know it's spelled with an A
[04:54:05] but so how do you pronounce it
[04:54:08] for me
[04:54:10] is preparing the grandest of a world
[04:54:12] copyright Yeah but I
[04:54:15] see okay I've heard people pronounce
[04:54:17] Fanta Fanta though which is why I don't
[04:54:19] know
[04:54:22] really
[04:54:24] I sent people to Hotel Deborah to
[04:54:26] investigate but whoever did this left no
[04:54:29] Trace at all
[04:54:33] that's when I figured out that you might
[04:54:35] be in danger and heard here as quickly
[04:54:37] as I could
[04:54:44] [Music]
[04:54:45] uh now we're caught up in this mess too
[04:54:48] well
[04:54:49] you did foil a plan that they were
[04:54:51] probably pretty proud of true and almost
[04:54:52] got their name in the process true
[04:54:54] speaking of which did anything did the
[04:54:57] black girls in our house primordial sea
[04:54:59] water
[04:55:00] Well it can't be coincidence that the
[04:55:02] traveler fainted just now she said that
[04:55:05] she heard that voice calling for vase
[04:55:07] again
[04:55:08] and this time
[04:55:11] but it was real faint on that the
[04:55:15] ability to hear voices like that through
[04:55:16] the one's sensitivity to the Hydra
[04:55:17] element
[04:55:23] to hydro when it's used on people who
[04:55:26] are not from Fontaine that doesn't sound
[04:55:28] like too much of a bad thing to be
[04:55:30] honest new Intel
[04:55:33] well let's hear it shall we there wasn't
[04:55:36] enough one of the missing women a person
[04:55:37] named vashi was a witness when she
[04:55:39] dissolved
[04:55:41] that is important
[04:55:47] vashay that name doesn't ring a bell
[04:55:51] I suppose he hasn't stepped forward as a
[04:55:53] witness in court lately
[04:55:54] since he saw that young woman dissolve
[04:55:57] he was at least at the crime scene but
[04:55:59] he never gave testimony or any
[04:56:01] information regarding people dissolving
[04:56:03] in the primordial sea water we should
[04:56:04] search from
[04:56:06] been threatened let's find them thank
[04:56:09] you this is very important all right
[04:56:11] partner

[04:58:51] confidently say it's the best we have
[04:58:53] thank you
[04:58:55] well our fun stuff she's broken a little
[04:58:58] tight lately
[04:59:00] allow illegal or unethical profiteering
[04:59:03] it's okay
[04:59:05] who support us
[04:59:08] like it's tough times for everyone
[04:59:10] but if you have the support of the
[04:59:12] people that does sound like it's worth
[04:59:14] it
[04:59:15] to be honest our financial situation was
[04:59:18] a lot better back when my father was in
[04:59:20] charge a few years ago
[04:59:23] I'm afraid I'm not quite as equal
[04:59:25] your father
[04:59:27] he was the previous boss of spina de
[04:59:30] rosula right
[04:59:32] how did he
[04:59:34] if you'll allow me to explain
[04:59:38] and no I'll explain it myself
[04:59:44] and partners this is something I hope
[04:59:46] they
[04:59:49] Baker's name is callus okay we know that
[04:59:52] one they call callous the Unfaithful
[04:59:54] streets the Unfaithful he was accused of
[04:59:58] murdering his own friend
[05:00:00] but he chose a duel to defend his honor
[05:00:02] instead of standing trial
[05:00:05] he died in the Duelist ring oh he died
[05:00:08] the [ __ ] chlorine because she's the
[05:00:09] Doula hey I know your father's
[05:00:11] Unfaithful I would be faithful just so
[05:00:14] you know it
[05:00:15] sorry I'll save it for Nev yet I'm sorry
[05:00:17] I'm sorry let me keep going okay so he
[05:00:19] died in the Duelist ring probably the
[05:00:20] [ __ ] floor end we'll see though I do
[05:00:23] my father was a murder
[05:00:25] I'm sure he was set up at the time I
[05:00:28] believed that if he only stood trial and
[05:00:30] was duly investigated something amiss
[05:00:33] would crop up and prove his innocence
[05:00:35] but strangely he not only requested the
[05:00:38] duel himself but Rumor Has It that even
[05:00:42] after being seriously injured to the
[05:00:44] point where he could be deemed as having
[05:00:46] lost the dude
[05:00:48] is to surrender determined to die in the
[05:00:51] arena
[05:00:53] three years later I still don't
[05:00:56] understand why he did that how could he
[05:00:58] protect his honor if he's dead
[05:01:02] if anything he gave up his chance to
[05:01:04] defend himself
[05:01:07] the closest piece of info I have is that
[05:01:09] my father had been investigating the
[05:01:11] serial disappearances case at the time
[05:01:13] of his death did he not have like a
[05:01:14] notebook that you could
[05:01:16] get to the bottom of that case
[05:01:19] that's right
[05:01:21] I've also tried to investigate the
[05:01:23] murder she couldn't end on a loss you
[05:01:26] have to run it back single new clue in
[05:01:28] my countless reviews
[05:01:31] however I believe that if the murder
[05:01:33] case is related to those behind the
[05:01:35] disappearances they must know something
[05:01:38] I must know what really happened
[05:01:41] was my father coerced framed even if he
[05:01:44] really did kill his friend I must get to
[05:01:47] the truth
[05:01:49] if only he'd been more open with me when
[05:01:52] he was still alive
[05:01:54] he even hid the fact that my mother died
[05:01:56] due to complications when giving birth
[05:01:58] to me such now here I am investigating
[05:02:01] his death
[05:02:03] you really are a handful aren't you Papa
[05:02:10] there was a place if there is anything I
[05:02:14] can do
[05:02:14] anything at all let me just say we're
[05:02:17] quite alike in the sense that we're
[05:02:19] looking for Truth for our family bro her
[05:02:21] mom died giving birth to her and then
[05:02:23] her dad died like defending some [ __ ]
[05:02:25] all we're doing is finding our brother
[05:02:27] our brother oh no well my brother that's
[05:02:30] it that's literally it
[05:02:32] we got to live their comfortable life
[05:02:34] with [ __ ] with [ __ ] any of the
[05:02:36] people we met thus far
[05:02:38] I'm sorry there's more to that I know I
[05:02:40] know there's more lower to lumine but I
[05:02:43] I also will never believe that Master
[05:02:46] kallus murdered yeah also our brother is
[05:02:48] a criminal the head of the crypt I mean
[05:02:51] he's probably like mind controlled but
[05:02:53] still he's definitely yet
[05:02:56] all it took was one murder case for him
[05:02:59] to be dubbed callous the unfaithful
[05:03:02] leaving our supporters decreased greatly
[05:03:04] due to that incident hence our strained
[05:03:07] finances at present great if Paris was
[05:03:12] such a good man what people at least be
[05:03:15] a little suspicious
[05:03:16] used
[05:03:17] ah no perhaps people just could you
[05:03:20] imagine what kind of drama it's not
[05:03:22] something exclusive to people from
[05:03:24] Fontaine really everyone's like that
[05:03:28] people love watching the evil turn over
[05:03:30] a new Leaf but they also enjoy watching
[05:03:33] good people fall into an abyss from one
[05:03:35] slip up just as much
[05:03:39] never mind
[05:03:41] if callus was really falsely accused we
[05:03:44] have to find the truth
[05:03:46] to have that happen to him and there is
[05:03:49] one other thing yeah
[05:03:53] I figured that on our own
[05:03:58] huh
[05:04:00] well then isn't that yeah
[05:04:03] Miss clorand has always placed great
[05:04:06] emphasis on the honorable nature of the
[05:04:09] duel
[05:04:10] if her opponent doesn't yield she will
[05:04:13] not stop either she knew Master kallus
[05:04:16] beforehand and greatly respected him but
[05:04:18] I mean she probably could have just been
[05:04:20] like I mean she probably could have been
[05:04:22] like you know maybe I won't kill my my
[05:04:24] friend's dad but is what it is I guess
[05:04:28] not that I don't understand her at all
[05:04:30] but I
[05:04:35] died
[05:04:36] knows how you feel
[05:04:38] you don't have to force yourself to do
[05:04:40] that
[05:04:41] afterward Ms Quran told us that at the
[05:04:44] start of the jewel Master kallus
[05:04:46] requested that she ensured the Marcel
[05:04:49] navia's safety
[05:04:52] yeah that makes sense he did indicate
[05:04:55] that yeah he didn't tend to die in the
[05:04:57] door
[05:04:58] oh papa
[05:05:00] what Madness drove you to ask the person
[05:05:02] who killed you to take care of me all
[05:05:05] right anyway that's the information I
[05:05:08] wanted to share with you even if it did
[05:05:10] sound like I was just yeah that's right
[05:05:12] yeah I don't think clarin's in the wrong
[05:05:13] but still she could have just like tied
[05:05:15] him up [ __ ] it you lost and then he's
[05:05:17] not dead then it goes to the [ __ ]
[05:05:19] jail or whatever but I mean I guess he
[05:05:21] just wanted to die so whatever
[05:05:23] huh I mean no like actually like not in
[05:05:25] a weird way just like don't kill him
[05:05:26] [ __ ] cut his legs there you go you
[05:05:28] can't walk
[05:05:29] [Laughter]
[05:05:31] whatever
[05:05:40] why are you question marking I'd rather
[05:05:42] not have legs than be dead what are you
[05:05:44] talking about Jackson get some sleep we
[05:05:46] will ensure you rest soundly
[05:05:49] ahaha mutilation so funny are you brain
[05:05:52] damaged actually like I'm concerned what
[05:05:54] are you saying what are you talking
[05:05:56] about I'm saying I'd rather not kill my
[05:05:59] friend's dad
[05:06:03] I'm not laughing actually yeah what okay
[05:06:05] I'm not laughing at the act of cutting
[05:06:07] his legs I'm saying I'd rather do that
[05:06:09] than kill him
[05:06:11] yeah
[05:06:12] anyways this person's weird
[05:06:20] uh
[05:06:22] uh what the [ __ ] is this
[05:06:23] let me redo it I missed it I didn't miss
[05:06:26] it
[05:06:36] they're not friends yeah I mean fair
[05:06:38] enough but still
[05:06:41] like it makes sense for her to kill him
[05:06:42] I'm just saying like if she didn't want
[05:06:44] you shouldn't you know
[05:06:46] but it does make sense like I get it
[05:06:48] where did the other two Go Master
[05:06:50] duelist opponent doesn't yield you're
[05:06:52] gonna kill them origin
[05:07:00] the feeling that you're just trying to
[05:07:01] get them off your back
[05:07:05] but never mind that when did you get
[05:07:08] back were you
[05:07:09] weird the whole time
[05:07:10] no I just returned after going out for a
[05:07:13] while yeah it's also more yeah I mean
[05:07:16] like regarding you probably wouldn't
[05:07:17] want to live after that though you're
[05:07:18] getting disrespected like that I don't
[05:07:20] know
[05:07:21] hi
[05:07:26] I guess time I wasn't speaking for it
[05:07:29] unfortunately this name seems to have
[05:07:31] been wiped from existence it doesn't
[05:07:33] seem to have a match anywhere I suspect
[05:07:37] that those behind this have already
[05:07:38] taken steps to hinder an investigation
[05:07:41] from this angle
[05:07:42] but that does prove that this fashay
[05:07:46] person is a key witness in the incident
[05:07:48] sauce
[05:07:52] no there is one Ray of Hope one place
[05:07:57] that they would find almost impossible
[05:07:59] to threaten no matter how much they
[05:08:01] wanted to
[05:08:02] and that is the archives kept by Chief
[05:08:05] yes okay oh don't worry I'll go visit
[05:08:09] him no worries I'll take care of this
[05:08:10] you just stay here I'll go check up on
[05:08:12] them make sure everything have you met
[05:08:13] is one of the young women who went
[05:08:15] missing recently we should be able to
[05:08:17] find some related info in there
[05:08:23] Hive of Case Files
[05:08:25] guess that's the hard-working chief
[05:08:28] justice for you in that case let's go
[05:08:30] talk to him
[05:08:31] um
[05:08:32] aren't you coming along now no I got it
[05:08:35] don't worry pop on you can stay here too

[05:08:45] okay
[05:08:46] Quest step complete
[05:08:51] that was uh I mean I guess that was like
[05:08:53] more
[05:08:55] we got to learn Navi has passed
[05:08:58] dual system's weird in general yeah I
[05:09:01] mean I assume that the moral of this
[05:09:03] story is that [ __ ] the whole justice
[05:09:05] system in this region is flawed I don't
[05:09:07] know maybe that won't be the [ __ ]
[05:09:08] conclusion but it feels like it so we'll
[05:09:11] see
[05:09:12] hopefully hopefully they come to that
[05:09:14] realization but maybe not I mean I don't
[05:09:17] know
[05:09:19] [Music]

[05:13:02] case criminal or civil in the past
[05:13:04] several years
[05:13:06] there are no records of him either in
[05:13:08] the files or in my memory
[05:13:11] what if it was really just a dream is
[05:13:14] that so
[05:13:16] okay no wish that what if it was a dream
[05:13:17] after what happened in [ __ ] sumeru
[05:13:19] we'll take car leave now do you not
[05:13:21] remember
[05:13:23] beep
[05:13:31] Miss Navia I can understand how you feel

[05:13:37] the hell look at that it was a truly
[05:13:38] exceptional man
[05:13:40] we deeply regret his past
[05:13:43] thumb
[05:13:50] and what are you trying to say Mr
[05:13:52] novelette uh oh
[05:13:55] are you trying to console me
[05:13:58] he was just like your dad's cool press
[05:14:01] some tendril of regret yo you you don't
[05:14:05] need to do any of that I can hear it in
[05:14:07] your voice no no emotion behind your
[05:14:11] words you only said those things because
[05:14:14] you felt like you should no
[05:14:20] it's just like last time
[05:14:22] after my father took his place in the
[05:14:24] Duelist ring I pushed through the guards
[05:14:26] to talk to you as a last resort oh she's
[05:14:29] got a cooking but chill you thought
[05:14:31] there was something fishy with the case
[05:14:32] yet you still allowed the girl to go
[05:14:34] ahead in your eyes the value of a human
[05:14:37] life is nothing compared to those cold
[05:14:40] laws you hold so dear if you truly
[05:14:43] regret my father's death
[05:14:45] then why didn't you call a stop to the
[05:14:47] duel
[05:14:48] why didn't you give me the power to stop
[05:14:50] him from throwing his life away why did
[05:14:53] you just let him die argon's order is
[05:14:55] not his fault
[05:14:57] okay
[05:14:59] on a thread at that moment
[05:15:01] just the tiniest effort could have
[05:15:04] changed everything
[05:15:06] there are still so many things I never
[05:15:08] got to tell him such
[05:15:11] so many questions he still owes me
[05:15:13] answers too
[05:15:14] if you really have no heart then just
[05:15:18] look me in the eyes
[05:15:20] I Nadia will show you the true meaning
[05:15:23] of regret
[05:15:30] navya
[05:15:32] you and my father are truly alike you
[05:15:36] keep all kinds of things in your heart
[05:15:38] and never say a word to anyone
[05:15:45] so much that you can't feel but that you
[05:15:48] would never express anything
[05:15:50] oh well in any case everyone already
[05:15:53] knows full well the apathy of the Chief
[05:15:56] Justice
[05:15:57] my apologies for taking my emotions out
[05:16:00] on you Michelle chief justice she's just
[05:16:01] leaving let's go traveler in pymon
[05:16:08] with that okay what the [ __ ]
[05:16:12] just said what you have to say in Feast
[05:16:14] I mean
[05:16:16] I mean fair enough
[05:16:18] I mean
[05:16:24] [Music]
[05:16:27] Navia are you okay
[05:16:31] but it's raining
[05:16:40] wasn't it still sunny when we went into
[05:16:42] the building and there shouldn't be any
[05:16:44] active trials today now that I think of
[05:16:46] it on the day my father was convicted I
[05:16:49] might be spoiler because I remember
[05:16:50] seeing fan art of this so I might have
[05:16:52] debated all of me but like
[05:16:54] the [ __ ] the the emo boy at the start
[05:16:57] was like when the rain dragon cries it
[05:16:59] rains and then he's probably crying now
[05:17:01] so it's raining so I assume that makes
[05:17:03] it that means that he's you know so
[05:17:05] that's probably what just happened but
[05:17:12] perfect did you think of something
[05:17:18] um
[05:17:21] obviously like a more though is that
[05:17:22] [ __ ] up I don't know
[05:17:25] yeah he probably didn't have a choice to
[05:17:27] be honest why
[05:17:31] do you think the rain could have
[05:17:32] affected the crime scene
[05:17:34] that thought has occurred to us before
[05:17:35] we've even expanded the search area to
[05:17:38] try to account for that but didn't find
[05:17:40] anything of value
[05:17:44] oh
[05:17:46] wait
[05:17:47] you don't mean well I didn't really know
[05:17:49] what I clicked on I'm a [ __ ] dumbass
[05:17:51] I heard what she said the fact that
[05:17:53] people can be turned into water
[05:17:55] that the true murderer could have been
[05:17:57] turned into water and then got washed
[05:17:59] away with the rain
[05:18:03] what happened
[05:18:04] no one would have believed your dad even
[05:18:06] if he explained explicit the authorities
[05:18:09] um I really think I found a true genius
[05:18:11] for a partner
[05:18:13] you're completely wait that's [ __ ]
[05:18:15] imagine
[05:18:17] that's earlier

[05:18:43] but if her dad didn't ego he literally
[05:18:45] could have just not fought went to jail
[05:18:47] then his daughter would have proved his
[05:18:48] [ __ ] innocence because she's about to
[05:18:49] and then boomi's saved because we're
[05:18:51] about to be like oh he was innocent

[05:18:56] but he had to Ego it

[05:19:09] beat you

[05:19:59] Discovery opportunity ambition and
[05:20:02] Conquest

[05:21:25] I like how it's Yolanda scarra's like
[05:21:27] biggest enemies are like slightly
[05:21:29] slanted slopes
[05:21:39] apologies for the wait
[05:21:41] apologies you said before that you still
[05:21:44] had some business at the court what
[05:21:46] brings you back to Boston oh thanks to
[05:21:48] the plus one raid huge about that it's
[05:21:52] because my partner here reminded me of
[05:21:54] something really important
[05:21:55] you see what if my father's case had
[05:21:58] something to do with water from the
[05:21:59] primordial sea you still remember right
[05:22:01] the loose on that night it was raining
[05:22:04] yes the case was quite similar to that
[05:22:07] of Mr linny's both were what you'd call
[05:22:11] impossible murders
[05:22:13] can the mass mind be the same person
[05:22:16] can you tell more about what happened
[05:22:17] before Oh yes of course
[05:22:21] heard on him
[05:22:28] drink that could oh like absence your
[05:22:30] mood literally absence which is like 70
[05:22:33] alcohol
[05:22:40] to produce some kind of potion yes he
[05:22:44] did
[05:22:45] considering what we know now it's almost
[05:22:47] a drug okay
[05:22:51] if you drink sins for an extended amount
[05:22:53] of time you'll suffer many side effects
[05:22:55] such as losing the ability to focus or
[05:22:57] control your I mean that's literally
[05:22:59] alcohol so I mean it might be true
[05:23:00] completely you'll experience also
[05:23:03] literally alcohol
[05:23:05] lacking energy to do anything
[05:23:07] it's an extremely dangerous substance as
[05:23:10] he overslept with some my father was
[05:23:13] compelled to put a stop to scent of use
[05:23:15] and called for a complete ban of it
[05:23:17] boss's uncompromising attitude incurred
[05:23:20] the synth Fender's wrath but no matter
[05:23:22] how much they threatened or bribed him
[05:23:25] he refused to yield not only that boss
[05:23:29] became determined to find the Mastermind
[05:23:31] behind the synth operation and put an
[05:23:34] end to the problem once did holy uh I'm
[05:23:36] not gonna say that I am going to say
[05:23:38] that
[05:23:41] so he could never get anything
[05:23:42] respectfully respectfully respectfully
[05:23:43] respectfully respectfully he sold the
[05:23:45] stuff and weren't privy to the rest of
[05:23:47] the operations
[05:23:48] I appreciate the art from the artist
[05:23:50] that's all contact the dealers anything
[05:23:52] weird and cultivate personal
[05:23:54] relationships with them
[05:23:56] finally he was able to convince someone
[05:23:58] to become his informant
[05:24:00] the man's name was Jacques Jacques he
[05:24:03] felt greatly ashamed about his work
[05:24:04] after seeing many families destroyed oh
[05:24:07] it's like open hype okay I'm sorry I'm
[05:24:10] sorry I'm sorry at his Countryside
[05:24:12] estate
[05:24:21] he raced to the scene and found my
[05:24:22] father oh still hold ing a gun
[05:24:25] I mean based honestly W father for doing
[05:24:28] that if he did
[05:24:30] happen aren't they on the same side
[05:24:35] sounds just like Lenny's case doesn't it
[05:24:37] in both cases the culprit seemed obvious
[05:24:40] but neither appeared to have any motive
[05:24:42] at all
[05:24:43] looking back on it though I I now
[05:24:46] believe the most important clue was
[05:24:48] something we all overlooked at the time
[05:24:50] there were pieces of clothing left at
[05:24:52] the scene
[05:24:59] precisely it's all things to you that I
[05:25:02] made the connection now back then we all
[05:25:04] just thought they were some costumes
[05:25:06] that Jacques used to disguise himself at
[05:25:08] the banquet but considering it now it's
[05:25:12] almost certain that they belong to a
[05:25:14] third person at the scene with one extra
[05:25:17] person well actually maybe I'm just too
[05:25:19] tired and I didn't [ __ ] remember but
[05:25:21] I don't remember what the wait what the
[05:25:22] [ __ ] is the relationship between the
[05:25:23] father and jok was just the dude that
[05:25:25] made the thing but maybe I [ __ ] I'm
[05:25:28] too tired to focus like maybe your
[05:25:29] father onto argument with a joke but
[05:25:31] it's also possible that the third person
[05:25:32] was to blame you're right
[05:25:34] you're right we still don't know what
[05:25:35] happened
[05:25:36] but my intuition tells me that became
[05:25:39] allies to figuring it all out
[05:25:42] foreign
[05:25:52] it's unlikely that he turned on boss
[05:25:54] with zero warning I think this third
[05:25:57] person is probably the key to the full
[05:25:59] truth
[05:26:01] on that note however
[05:26:03] even though this yeah maybe don't shoot
[05:26:05] the information
[05:26:08] I must still offer a word of warning
[05:26:12] is Insidious and cruel they are
[05:26:16] extremely difficult to deal with and
[05:26:17] boss has already lost his life trying to
[05:26:20] bring them to justice even though Spina
[05:26:22] de rosula is lost most of its former
[05:26:25] glory poisson has welcomed songs
[05:26:29] that bird looks cool live out our lives
[05:26:32] okay there's no need to follow your
[05:26:34] father's path
[05:26:36] it'll be both wise and in line with
[05:26:38] bosses wishes to step back and give up
[05:26:42] on the case if that's indeed what he
[05:26:45] wished for then he should have told me
[05:26:47] that himself was I not the closest
[05:26:50] person to him
[05:26:51] and yet I was the one most kept in the
[05:26:54] dark what was the point of him dying
[05:26:57] without sharing any of the secrets he
[05:26:59] knew did he manage to protect anything
[05:27:02] in the end synth is still here
[05:27:06] callous the Unfaithful is still his
[05:27:09] epithet and spina de rosula is barely
[05:27:12] getting by
[05:27:14] nothing has changed did he think I just
[05:27:17] accept his meaningless death and live
[05:27:19] out my life just as meaninglessly I've
[05:27:22] never accepted that ever not since that
[05:27:26] day and certainly not now I want to find
[05:27:29] out the real answer for everyone's sake
[05:27:32] for the missing girls for the victims
[05:27:35] and for myself
[05:27:37] yeah this is indeed the best moment to
[05:27:40] act
[05:27:41] your partner appears to be quite
[05:27:43] reliable and more importantly de Marcel
[05:27:46] I think you're also ready to take this
[05:27:49] off okay
[05:27:52] yes I do
[05:27:55] in fact even before that banquet's boss
[05:27:57] already knew of the connection between
[05:27:59] synth and the serial disappearances case
[05:28:02] but what drove all the tensions to the
[05:28:05] boiling point was the Revelation that
[05:28:07] you de moiselle all selected as the next
[05:28:10] Target disappear
[05:28:12] what
[05:28:16] boss also didn't tell you that he
[05:28:20] had been diagnosed with a rare illness
[05:28:23] the doctors told me Elias are we cured
[05:28:26] that we did the Subaru thing
[05:28:31] caused him great anxiety
[05:28:35] five years was nowhere near enough time
[05:28:38] to resolve this long-standing conflict
[05:28:43] all the danger would pass on to you
[05:28:46] knowing all of this
[05:28:48] he decided to use one final intimidation
[05:28:51] tactic before his death
[05:28:54] he claimed to have already gotten his
[05:28:56] hands on some key incriminating evidence
[05:28:58] for the other side and even told some
[05:29:01] members of spina de rosula about the
[05:29:04] details but as long as you remain safe
[05:29:06] he would not share the evidence with the
[05:29:09] plank if something were to happen to you
[05:29:12] then he and all those he told would
[05:29:14] immediately expose all they knew about
[05:29:16] synth in the Disappeared victims right
[05:29:19] so nobody would be as we've seen bosses
[05:29:22] acting has worked even though boss has
[05:29:24] been gone for a long time the other side
[05:29:26] has not tried to take to myself's life
[05:29:29] no
[05:29:31] I don't believe it he never appeared to
[05:29:33] look sick to me no father wants their
[05:29:36] daughter to see them weak and Haggard
[05:29:38] especially someone as proud as boss
[05:29:43] that's true I'm dying in a jewel and
[05:29:45] suffering lasting dishonor as the
[05:29:47] Unfaithful dude okay uh dad Laura I
[05:29:51] guess I'm still pissed at him for this
[05:29:53] to this day well my dad had kovid we
[05:29:55] laugh okay I have in my extended family
[05:29:57] there's like a few like medical
[05:29:59] professionals like my my cousin's a
[05:30:01] doctor and like literally like when he
[05:30:03] had kovid it was like really bad for him
[05:30:05] but anytime we'd ask or check it on him
[05:30:07] or like whatever you'd never say
[05:30:09] anything and then there's a point where
[05:30:10] you're like literally
[05:30:12] he literally rewrote his will without
[05:30:15] [ __ ] telling us and I was like dude
[05:30:17] we have like we could have done whatever
[05:30:19] he's fine all's good now but like
[05:30:22] [ __ ] I don't know so I swear
[05:30:25] it's like they don't want to just they
[05:30:26] don't want to let anyone know they're in
[05:30:27] pain it's like bro it's like it's okay
[05:30:30] so he chose to die that was like two
[05:30:32] years ago so that he could
[05:30:44] put a sword if boss's Spirit could hear
[05:30:48] you telling me that you want to find the
[05:30:51] answer for the sake of everyone involved
[05:30:53] I mean hey he beat it but still it's
[05:30:54] like dude
[05:30:57] that fool
[05:31:00] couldn't he have just given it to me
[05:31:02] straight no
[05:31:04] he might have set up everything
[05:31:06] precisely because
[05:31:07] he never thought I'd be able to
[05:31:10] understand him is that the amount of
[05:31:12] confidence he had in me
[05:31:14] and what if I was never able to make it
[05:31:16] to where I am now such
[05:31:19] he wanted to give you the choice to live
[05:31:21] how you want or he gave you the choice
[05:31:22] to live how you want yeah
[05:31:25] I suppose that's true
[05:31:34] it's true but thankfully he rarely
[05:31:36] talked to me about complex matters and
[05:31:39] thus understood little of me as a person
[05:31:42] in this case he really didn't need to
[05:31:44] give me an easy way out
[05:31:47] the loose what was the key evidence that
[05:31:49] he shared with you okay
[05:31:53] actually it's fine I was just gonna say
[05:31:55] you could have said this before we went
[05:31:56] and like talked to nevia and all that
[05:31:58] but all good I mean location where synth
[05:32:01] is produced essentially
[05:32:04] it's the enemy's headquarters
[05:32:07] when he was threatening the enemy boss
[05:32:09] didn't share the specifics of the
[05:32:12] incriminating evidence he found
[05:32:14] but if you want to use it against the
[05:32:16] enemy
[05:32:17] you'll still have to take several things
[05:32:19] into consideration
[05:32:21] why if we know where the place are you
[05:32:25] gonna do all the acts today at ziox
[05:32:27] clueless isn't this the last Act is it
[05:32:29] just two this is two what do you mean
[05:32:31] there's literally about to finish
[05:32:34] fighting against a mysterious and
[05:32:37] dangerous
[05:32:42] there's no telling what
[05:32:48] whatems we may be able to find inside
[05:32:50] nor what people we may be able to
[05:32:52] capture the only thing is single visit
[05:32:55] to their headquarters it looks like the
[05:32:57] accident at the end but I remember
[05:32:58] people telling me that act two
[05:33:00] makes you like Farina more and we
[05:33:02] haven't seen her at all in this act so
[05:33:04] that means there's probably at least
[05:33:05] another like [ __ ] hour but anyways
[05:33:07] worst case would be that we leave
[05:33:10] empty-handed
[05:33:11] or like at least you get to know her
[05:33:13] more I don't know but retaliation maybe
[05:33:15] not I mean maybe not but
[05:33:17] why not work with the Fontaine
[05:33:19] authorities well you saw one of them
[05:33:21] dissolve during Mr linny's I don't like
[05:33:23] her more and I didn't act too okay well
[05:33:25] we'll see just how thoroughly they may
[05:33:27] have been infiltrated
[05:33:30] it's true
[05:33:31] seems my father really had no choice but
[05:33:34] things are different now it should be a
[05:33:37] lot easier to prove the other side's
[05:33:39] guilt now that we've connected since
[05:33:41] with a disappearances case
[05:33:43] you sound like you've put a lot of stuff
[05:33:45] I am the butler after all I live but to
[05:33:48] serve the boss and the muscle let's get
[05:33:50] the chat I like them I've always do we
[05:33:52] get to learn more about silver because
[05:33:54] all of you guys love [ __ ] silver what
[05:33:55] did he do he didn't say anything he was
[05:33:57] just like I dab shades
[05:34:07] he's not even here have you discovered
[05:34:10] anything new in the past few years
[05:34:17] he's just there with shades
[05:34:21] when I announced orders to the
[05:34:23] organization's members on demoiselle's
[05:34:25] behalf I used to deliver he did have the
[05:34:28] almonds ready that is true he had the
[05:34:30] almonds ready for the [ __ ] macaroons
[05:34:31] true
[05:34:38] if the vendors backed up and fled
[05:34:40] however then someone must have given
[05:34:42] them the news after several rounds of
[05:34:45] testing an investigative tracing I've
[05:34:48] narrowed the suspect list down to three
[05:34:50] people okay three first is floral Spina
[05:34:54] de rasula's senior advisor
[05:34:56] okay he's dressed like Lugoff no one
[05:35:00] dressed like a girl who do anything
[05:35:01] wrong but I also think look up evil boss
[05:35:04] trust Ed the most which also means that
[05:35:07] he was someone who understood boss
[05:35:09] really well okay thanks to his position
[05:35:11] within bosses in a most Circle he always
[05:35:14] knew our upcoming plan there's someone
[05:35:16] else like him too
[05:35:18] Marcel Carrie bear oh my God
[05:35:22] Uncle Marcel
[05:35:28] Marcel
[05:35:29] the boss helped it to grow to its
[05:35:32] current size and prominence in the
[05:35:34] beginning there were only reselling some
[05:35:37] daily Goods but now they're one of the
[05:35:40] richest guilds around with a lot of
[05:35:41] Business Connection so they're like a
[05:35:44] sister yes you can say that okay when we
[05:35:47] were fighting against the synth dealers
[05:35:49] they provided us with plenty of support
[05:35:52] it's a bit difficult to imagine someone
[05:35:54] using their own money to hunt down
[05:35:57] themselves the final suspect is teary
[05:36:01] responsible for coordinating information
[05:36:03] this guy looks like a car gotta miss him
[05:36:06] it's him get him get him get him all the
[05:36:08] guards mostly leave us to our own
[05:36:10] devices there are still many activities
[05:36:13] we have to report to the local
[05:36:14] authorities since teary is always in the
[05:36:17] know about our current activities he
[05:36:20] could theoretically always plan one step
[05:36:22] ahead I see
[05:36:24] these these all people who I communicate
[05:36:27] with quite regularly
[05:36:30] you've been fighting fighting against
[05:36:31] has been right next to me all along
[05:36:33] among us the most
[05:36:36] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'll stop too
[05:36:38] hard if you want to investigate them
[05:36:40] please take every precaution to not
[05:36:42] alert the Quarry judging from our
[05:36:45] experience the enemy is extremely
[05:36:48] cautious
[05:36:49] of course and thank you malus you're too
[05:36:53] kind my lady you're too quiet my lady
[05:36:55] forgets approving boss after that
[05:36:58] incident Jacques wife and daughter were
[05:37:00] taken into the spina's care they still
[05:37:02] live in poisson today if it might help
[05:37:05] you could also pay them a visit
[05:37:08] a new case awaits my dear partner
[05:37:12] hell yeah partner we can work together
[05:37:14] to uncover the truth
[05:37:17] huh kallus case records
[05:37:21] okay
[05:37:22] is there another trial to do
[05:37:25] pog

[05:37:29] uh hydroculus here is it over here
[05:37:34] there it is
[05:37:40] all right let's go visit Jacques family

[05:37:56] excuse me and enjoy your conversation at
[05:37:58] your leisure thank you for us we didn't
[05:38:02] actually hit the cat don't worry
[05:38:06] Excuse Me Miss
[05:38:08] do you need anything from us you should
[05:38:10] skip the kids dialogue and wait why
[05:38:18] is she mad badge
[05:38:21] I'm sorry that I only came to visit
[05:38:24] after all this time
[05:38:26] after what happened I didn't know how I
[05:38:29] was supposed to face the two of you ah
[05:38:32] if it's about that there's no need to
[05:38:34] apologize
[05:38:35] after my husband died Spina di rasula
[05:38:39] sent us a lot of mura and support but
[05:38:41] wait did I skip something things nothing
[05:38:44] compared to the loss of Jacques
[05:38:48] I can understand the kind of pain that
[05:38:51] comes with losing a father so needlessly
[05:38:53] okay I'm gonna say it I'm not gonna say
[05:38:55] it you don't understand at all I didn't
[05:38:58] know how to face you because I didn't
[05:39:00] know what I could possibly bring as a
[05:39:02] consolation gift I know only the full
[05:39:05] truth could bring closure to you mm-hmm
[05:39:08] I'm sorry
[05:39:10] I appreciate the sentiment but you don't
[05:39:13] have to carry all that guilt on the
[05:39:15] matter regarding my husband my daughter
[05:39:18] and I have more or less found our answer
[05:39:20] already would you mind sharing it with
[05:39:23] me
[05:39:24] I really can't believe that my father
[05:39:27] could ever bring himself to shoot
[05:39:29] Jacques I always knew that my husband's
[05:39:31] money was earned through others
[05:39:33] suffering thumb he told me countless
[05:39:35] times that if he could turn back the
[05:39:37] clock he would never go into the synth
[05:39:39] business again he had many regrets and
[05:39:42] felt that he took the idea of providing
[05:39:44] for his family too little time he was
[05:39:46] literally Walter White
[05:39:51] he's callus came to
[05:39:52] proposal he accepted it almost
[05:39:54] immediately he tried to be as careful as
[05:39:57] he could
[05:39:58] Walter he was still found out by the
[05:40:00] higher-ups
[05:40:02] they found out about his betrayal Papa
[05:40:05] didn't say that exactly but Papa did
[05:40:08] tell me that I should never be
[05:40:09] ungrateful who asked or he left that day
[05:40:12] he told me that he had no choice
[05:40:16] it was only later that I realized it was
[05:40:18] his final farewell wait does that mean
[05:40:21] someone ordered Jack to take out callous
[05:40:23] I don't know that for sure
[05:40:25] but you could say that's the conclusion
[05:40:28] I eventually came to okay that's [ __ ]
[05:40:32] which is why I'm the one who should feel
[05:40:34] guilty callus had always taken great
[05:40:37] care of us both when he was still alive
[05:40:39] and after he passed away hey Jack wanted
[05:40:41] to kill her dad he fired the shot that
[05:40:43] killed my husband husband it was likely
[05:40:46] in self-defense
[05:40:48] it is impossible for me to hate him for
[05:40:50] what he had but mama why is Papa still
[05:40:53] the bad guy if he did the right thing
[05:40:57] shut up kid go do your homework
[05:41:11] Papa was a really good man
[05:41:14] the best in the whole too far too far
[05:41:15] too far too far then you should hold on
[05:41:17] to that
[05:41:18] if a good man had to do a bad thing
[05:41:22] then he must have had his reasons
[05:41:24] regardless of whether he left you a
[05:41:26] parasol or a sword
[05:41:29] he must have done so to give you a
[05:41:32] better life true
[05:41:34] thank you for everything you've told me
[05:41:38] I will definitely find the truth maybe
[05:41:41] it's so awesome current state of things
[05:41:42] is not something I'm willing to just sit
[05:41:44] back and accept thank you even though
[05:41:48] your personality is quite different from
[05:41:50] your father's
[05:41:51] your determination when you speak is
[05:41:54] really similar you really think so
[05:41:56] that's the first time anyone said that
[05:41:59] to me oh
[05:42:02] foreign

[05:42:47] today I don't like this guy's beard I
[05:42:49] don't like his neck beard it's giving me
[05:42:51] bad vibes I'm sure you've heard about
[05:42:52] what happens at the Opera House
[05:42:55] one got turned into water right in front
[05:42:57] of us
[05:42:58] yeah I've heard something that dramatic
[05:43:01] I'm sure journalists will milk it for
[05:43:03] all it's a great beard no it's like not
[05:43:06] full it's just like bottom it also
[05:43:09] reminds me Fang called him the Jeff he
[05:43:11] does not look like suggest that is an
[05:43:13] insult does it just looks way better
[05:43:15] than that we found some clothes left at
[05:43:16] the scene the draft 77.
[05:43:29] so see is the dev actually he actually
[05:43:31] has a beard that's like more full
[05:43:34] this guy just has just just like the
[05:43:36] chin straps after my partner here put
[05:43:38] the dots together for me I feel like we
[05:43:41] should try to reopen his case
[05:43:45] do me a favor and try to recall what
[05:43:46] happened that night
[05:43:49] I can try
[05:43:51] um
[05:43:52] let me think
[05:43:54] Mr kallus was feeling pretty upbeat that
[05:43:57] day
[05:43:58] so he was drinking and bantering Away
[05:44:00] with us at the table
[05:44:02] who is the judge F at ziox
[05:44:06] no unknown
[05:44:10] just after that
[05:44:14] I wanted to go get some
[05:44:17] freak out thinking much of it
[05:44:19] who knew that we would hear two gunshots
[05:44:21] ring out right after
[05:44:25] my first reaction was that Mr callous's
[05:44:28] life was in danger so I grabbed my
[05:44:30] holster and made a Mad Dash toward the
[05:44:32] scene but when I got there
[05:44:35] it was already too late
[05:44:37] Mr kallus was standing over a dead body
[05:44:40] with a gun so you also remember two
[05:44:42] gunshots then indeed okay the guards
[05:44:45] reason being Mr kallus had left his gun
[05:44:48] on the table
[05:44:49] I even hopefully we get to do the actual
[05:44:51] like case trial thing in this act
[05:44:53] because if we acquire a bunch of
[05:44:55] evidence and then we wait till we have
[05:44:56] to wait till next patch to actually do
[05:44:58] anything I'm gonna be [ __ ] pissed
[05:44:59] judging by
[05:45:03] it's not
[05:45:05] the gun he was holding probably yeah
[05:45:08] that makes a lot of sense
[05:45:10] so you're saying Mr callous
[05:45:13] Allison because he seized it from one of
[05:45:14] the other guys
[05:45:16] but hold on
[05:45:18] if that's what had happened
[05:45:20] then why didn't he share the truth with
[05:45:22] any of us he didn't even want to face
[05:45:25] the auratrice machine
[05:45:26] and chose instead to prove his honor in
[05:45:29] a duel
[05:45:31] maybe he didn't want to explain oh okay
[05:45:33] maybe this obvious but I feel like you
[05:45:34] didn't want to explain it because then
[05:45:35] his daughter would have been like it's
[05:45:36] all faith in the courts
[05:45:37] sings about that yeah
[05:45:42] so it's just not gonna explain it I
[05:45:43] understand why he committed to the duel
[05:45:46] I'll tell you everything once the whole
[05:45:48] truth has been revealed I understand
[05:45:51] then I'll leave Mr callous's honor in
[05:45:54] your hands boss and if I may just say
[05:45:56] one more thing
[05:45:58] the whole callous the Unfaithful epithet
[05:46:01] has been a thorn in my side since the
[05:46:03] day it was invented many people have
[05:46:05] laughed at me for still calling him Mr
[05:46:07] kallus even after so many years have
[05:46:10] passed but it was Mr callous's trust
[05:46:13] that allowed me to rise through the
[05:46:14] ranks of spina de rasula
[05:46:17] and live the life I lead today
[05:46:19] no matter what others might say
[05:46:22] don't worry I won't do anything
[05:46:26] okay we'll give on the truth sure
[05:46:30] let's go talk to [ __ ] Siri where is
[05:46:32] he this guy's a Narnia all good
[05:46:41] oh he's right here
[05:46:52] hey Thierry it's me I'm Thierry now what
[05:46:57] brings you here miss Navia oh so you've
[05:47:00] got news of that already oh okay
[05:47:03] hey I'm also a member of the guards
[05:47:06] let's go talk too slow I'm sorry are you
[05:47:08] sure there's
[05:47:16] I mean where I work is really up to me
[05:47:19] it's really up to me
[05:47:20] callous did a fantastic job running the
[05:47:23] town building Spina de rasula from the
[05:47:26] ground up and clearing many obstructions
[05:47:28] in my way it would be next to impossible
[05:47:31] for me to find a similarly easy but high
[05:47:34] paying job in the city okay anyway
[05:47:36] enough Chit Chat are these two friends
[05:47:39] of yours
[05:47:40] you were here for some formal business
[05:47:53] we're trying to reinvestigate the
[05:47:54] details of my father's old case ah I get
[05:47:58] it
[05:47:59] I think there might be more to the case
[05:48:01] now that we know people can be dissolved
[05:48:03] into water right I was I don't like this
[05:48:05] guy's talking when I first heard of it
[05:48:07] if you want to go through the original
[05:48:09] files from your father's case I can help
[05:48:12] you look for them that'd be much
[05:48:13] appreciated thank you
[05:48:16] actually I have another question
[05:48:19] do you have the authority to dispatch
[05:48:20] gardemex of course without them I
[05:48:23] couldn't possibly handle Paul saw On My
[05:48:26] Own
[05:48:27] Boss off I can handle fire on my own
[05:48:30] forcefully get more evidence for your
[05:48:33] father's well you you see just right we
[05:48:36] were attacked by a horde of unnumbered
[05:48:38] guardamex in the city
[05:48:40] so if you hypothetically wanted to do
[05:48:44] something against me
[05:48:45] all you would need to do is get rid of
[05:48:47] the mecca serial numbers and send them
[05:48:50] after me
[05:48:53] then you think too highly of my
[05:48:55] abilities okay dispatching Mecca is
[05:48:58] different from controlling them okay I
[05:49:00] had to make an analogy
[05:49:02] when you order a dish the chef will make
[05:49:04] it for you you can ask the chef if you
[05:49:07] try to make unreasonable removing a
[05:49:09] cereal nut so I can promise you those
[05:49:11] okay we're private units I skip the
[05:49:13] analogy I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[05:49:15] I'm sorry cheap so whoever their owner
[05:49:18] is must be super rich powerful or both
[05:49:23] now that you mention it though
[05:49:25] analogies dude my analogies are so much
[05:49:28] better enough to afford this what is the
[05:49:30] excellent right here right now it's
[05:49:31] that's my shark right here right now
[05:49:35] oh mine that was just so much better
[05:49:38] clear Thierry
[05:49:44] thank you for the vote of confidence
[05:49:45] enough Jokes Aside
[05:49:47] I'd like to wish you all the best with
[05:49:49] your investigation I'll be staying in
[05:49:50] the city for a little while so just come
[05:49:53] find me if you need any support from the
[05:49:54] guards
[05:49:58] hey that was definitely a dialogue
[05:50:02] how the [ __ ] do I get I just have to run
[05:50:16] thank you
[05:50:20] if I'm up today you're twitch link for
[05:50:22] the meow command but if there's another
[05:50:23] old one it's probably an updated we
[05:50:24] could do that
[05:50:27] who the [ __ ] is this hello how may I
[05:50:30] help you
[05:50:31] you're under arrest could you please let
[05:50:34] him know you can just say navias looking
[05:50:36] for him sure I will let him know right
[05:50:39] away
[05:50:46] hello sorry to keep you waiting I'm not
[05:50:50] as young as I used to be so my legs are
[05:50:52] Chad I hear my dad waking up
[05:50:54] uh I'm gonna have to sit in a way where
[05:50:57] he can't see me
[05:50:58] because it is currently 5 53 am
[05:51:03] and I don't want to explain if I don't
[05:51:05] have to
[05:51:13] I just wanted to talk to you briefly so
[05:51:16] minus one son
[05:51:18] saw everything too
[05:51:21] yes I've never seen okay so strange
[05:51:28] that's right I also witnessed
[05:51:32] quite impressive okay
[05:51:35] to beat the hydro archon at her own game
[05:51:38] on her own turf I can already imagine
[05:51:40] everyone in Fontaine discussing your
[05:51:42] exploits over a few glasses be [ __ ]
[05:51:45] pissed
[05:51:47] [Music]
[05:51:51] apologies it's just how Fontaine is as a
[05:51:55] nation everyone loves drama and theatric
[05:51:57] Uncle Marcel you've also noticed that
[05:52:00] other thing right the fact that humans
[05:52:02] can dissolve in water
[05:52:06] oh it's not on auto I was like why
[05:52:07] wasn't it playing I was reminded of your
[05:52:09] father's case right away is that what
[05:52:11] you're investigating now exactly
[05:52:14] I still don't have much solid proof but
[05:52:16] I can sense that the other side has
[05:52:19] already begun to act oh and what makes
[05:52:22] you say that we were attacked on arenais
[05:52:25] by some unnumbered guard Max and yeah
[05:52:28] true also an attempt to get me to drink
[05:52:29] water from the primordial that's also
[05:52:31] true if not for the vigilance of my
[05:52:33] partner I probably wouldn't even be here
[05:52:35] talking to you right now
[05:52:38] [Music]
[05:52:44] heating up again the piece that kallus
[05:52:47] sought so dearly will soon become so
[05:52:49] [ __ ] tired
[05:52:50] but rest assured Navia I need some
[05:52:52] action we'll always remain a safe haven
[05:52:54] for you
[05:52:55] scared you can always return there
[05:52:58] if anyone dares to lay their hands on
[05:53:00] you there the contrary of Cabrio will
[05:53:03] use its funds to the last Mora to bring
[05:53:05] them to justice thank you Uncle Marcel
[05:53:09] but I don't intend to go into hiding
[05:53:12] I'm going to strike while the Iron's hot
[05:53:14] okay do you have any new thoughts on my
[05:53:16] father's case ah about that sorry my age
[05:53:20] is catching up with me you don't even
[05:53:22] look that old you call my memory this
[05:53:25] guy's sauce
[05:53:26] the conferee was responsible for that
[05:53:28] banquet so I was out and about the whole
[05:53:30] oh the age is getting to me running
[05:53:31] smoothly I didn't even have the time to
[05:53:34] drink with the guests
[05:53:35] then I heard the sound of a gunshot and
[05:53:38] the rest was history oh it's okay no
[05:53:41] need to push yourself
[05:53:42] we'll ask around some more see if there
[05:53:45] are any valuable Clues elsewhere sounds
[05:53:47] good just let me know if you ever need
[05:53:49] more I need Mora oh my
[05:53:54] isn't she broke she just said she's
[05:53:56] broke
[05:53:57] yeah she'll take Morrow
[05:54:04] can I borrow
[05:54:06] hey man
[05:54:08] okay
[05:54:09] oh never mind I guess
[05:54:15] Mora
[05:54:24] useless all three suspects
[05:54:27] free based on their conversations with
[05:54:29] me none of them sounded particularly
[05:54:31] suspicious
[05:54:33] okay what if it might be one of them
[05:54:36] right it might be one of them right it
[05:54:38] might be one of them right but what if
[05:54:40] no spoilers shot okay you're not allowed
[05:54:41] to type spoilers anti-spoiler spam what
[05:54:44] if it's one of the dudes We Trust what
[05:54:46] if it's like the [ __ ] old dude or
[05:54:47] silver it's probably not silver because
[05:54:49] he's too cool a guy with Shades would
[05:54:51] never betrayals
[05:54:52] but I'm not gonna look at Chad because
[05:54:54] if that's true you guys would be like
[05:54:55] yeah
[05:55:01] what if it's like our friend anyway even
[05:55:03] though we didn't make a breakthrough
[05:55:04] let's still compile what we were able to
[05:55:06] find
[05:55:19] hmm that makes sense according to
[05:55:23] Jacques family members he already told
[05:55:25] them that he had been discovered and
[05:55:27] that he had no choice before he left
[05:55:29] home that day
[05:55:31] if I had to guess he probably received
[05:55:33] an order from the synth boss to kill my
[05:55:35] father
[05:55:36] and he refused
[05:55:38] he and his family's lives would have
[05:55:39] been forfeit so Jacques fired the first
[05:55:42] shot okay just to make sure there are no
[05:55:44] more there are no spoilers in chat so
[05:55:45] that I can actually read my chat uh
[05:55:47] we're quickly going to
[05:55:50] suspension
[05:55:54] [Music]
[05:56:04] all right back again I'm sorry
[05:56:07] you just got Toyota Corolla
[05:56:10] uh can you guarantee the safety after
[05:56:12] killing callus could he guarantee his
[05:56:14] families
[05:56:19] [Music]
[05:56:25] what would make more sense from his
[05:56:27] perspective would be to turn his back on
[05:56:30] the order and seek protection from my
[05:56:33] father true makes sense but without
[05:56:36] evidence that's still just a theory a
[05:56:39] game theory thanks for watching the
[05:56:42] attack on artemax has been bothering me
[05:56:44] quite a bit as well
[05:56:52] okay do you think he knew even then that
[05:56:55] we'd follow this lead to the end given
[05:56:58] everything that's happened since it's
[05:57:00] quite possible
[05:57:02] ability
[05:57:09] to control oh [ __ ] uh who could control
[05:57:11] the guardamax it was uh [ __ ] it was
[05:57:14] the dude when I was like oh like I
[05:57:16] skipped his analogy it was seriously you
[05:57:18] know who's that allergy I skip because
[05:57:20] he was like oh the Guardians
[05:57:24] it wasn't Florence I think it's Siri
[05:57:26] could say
[05:57:28] huh
[05:57:30] it is possible that he's figured out a
[05:57:32] way to convert the guardamex report but
[05:57:34] didn't feel like he was lying when he
[05:57:36] was talking to us about the Mecca
[05:57:38] I also don't think he'd be able to keep
[05:57:40] that kind of tampering Under Wraps
[05:57:44] he actually tampered with the mecca we'd
[05:57:46] be able to prove it with a simple boat
[05:57:48] to the guards inventory true maybe if
[05:57:51] the mecca were taken from the guards it
[05:57:53] should be pretty easy to find out when
[05:57:55] and
[05:58:00] oh oh
[05:58:01] his analogy was how he couldn't have
[05:58:03] tempered okay listen at least I was
[05:58:06] right with the guy that talks with the
[05:58:07] max at least I was right okay let me
[05:58:09] think about Flora I thought I was like
[05:58:10] yeah and then Marcel was the dude at the
[05:58:13] end or like the dude like that had the
[05:58:15] excess more uh yeah I guess at the end
[05:58:16] and he was like
[05:58:19] Uncle Marcel
[05:58:21] ah
[05:58:24] my father did really trust me you want
[05:58:26] sauce I didn't think he was awesome they
[05:58:27] worked together on a large number of
[05:58:28] projects maybe that's how we got to know
[05:58:31] Jacques
[05:58:34] and with funds from the contrary he
[05:58:36] could also afford true he was rich
[05:58:39] it's still hard for me to imagine though
[05:58:41] after all Uncle Marcel has been around
[05:58:43] since I was just
[05:58:45] so if it's neither of the three that I'm
[05:58:47] pissed because literally why are you
[05:58:48] giving me options to why are you making
[05:58:50] me make a fool out of myself man I said
[05:58:52] what if it's one of our friends what if
[05:58:53] the [ __ ] old dude that's helping us
[05:58:54] or the dude of the shade but you're like
[05:58:56] one of the reasons I have to go through
[05:58:58] three [ __ ] options it's not gonna be
[05:58:59] either
[05:59:02] it is true that he was closest to my
[05:59:04] father no it's not him man
[05:59:06] 's advisor his work mostly deals with
[05:59:09] personnel and security
[05:59:11] so so you're saying he's too broke damn
[05:59:13] that is [ __ ] especially all right the
[05:59:17] NASA says you moment but that's also
[05:59:19] [ __ ] exactly he can't
[05:59:21] and even if he could I don't think he
[05:59:24] would be able to dispatch a whole group
[05:59:26] so quickly
[05:59:27] nah
[05:59:28] that's [ __ ] that's [ __ ]
[05:59:32] yeah it's literally one of our friends
[05:59:38] where is he
[05:59:40] wait there's only the three I could
[05:59:42] select okay well let's read them
[05:59:45] Florida the advisor to Spina de rosula
[05:59:47] claimed that he was very grateful like
[05:59:49] Alice for his kindness he's also present
[05:59:50] with that Banky why'd I say like that at
[05:59:52] the banquet banquet on the day of his
[05:59:54] case and can provide evidence that
[05:59:55] kallus did not carry a gun
[05:59:57] Thierry is the person responsible for
[06:00:00] official contact between Spina and
[06:00:03] guards according to him only the
[06:00:05] sufficiently rich can uh own privately
[06:00:09] large numbers of guardamax Marcel Marcel
[06:00:12] is the leader of the conference that's
[06:00:15] not how you say it but whatever and was
[06:00:17] the organizer of the banquet years prior
[06:00:19] the conferi and the Spina de rosula have
[06:00:23] always maintained a close working
[06:00:24] relationship those recollection events
[06:00:26] it's foggy he's always a fan of you
[06:00:29] oh I didn't read the question which of
[06:00:31] these suspects was most likely to have
[06:00:32] committed the crime the serial
[06:00:34] disappearances of young women
[06:00:38] this guy has like the
[06:00:40] the like
[06:00:42] redditor beard no disrespect though
[06:00:45] um
[06:00:54] I mean this guy was rich
[06:01:02] it's either the cop or the rich dude in
[06:01:04] my opinion if I'm just wearing a guess
[06:01:05] from these three because all the other
[06:01:07] sets are relevant
[06:01:14] I'm not gonna look at Chad for a second
[06:01:15] ah
[06:01:24] you know if you think everything through
[06:01:26] let's go Marcel is indeed the most
[06:01:30] suspicious of them all can we be missing
[06:01:32] it was my son my God my ghost how many
[06:01:34] sauce
[06:01:36] [Music]
[06:01:39] I don't remember but I have Maura if you
[06:01:42] want that's what he said he's trying to
[06:01:44] bribe us
[06:01:47] and his Judgment of others
[06:01:48] trustworthiness has been Fair it wasn't
[06:01:50] even old he's like 42 acting like he's
[06:01:52] old the guy was like 35. no he gave me
[06:01:55] made a lot he was like 50 at most the
[06:01:58] suspect is knowledgeable oh I'm so old
[06:02:00] has the means to dispatch Mecca to
[06:02:03] assassinate US
[06:02:04] and possesses significant intellect and
[06:02:07] foresight
[06:02:09] even if I don't want to believe it I'm
[06:02:12] starting to see how things could all tie
[06:02:13] back to Uncle Marcel true
[06:02:17] this card on top of all the theorizing
[06:02:18] and speculating yes malus did say that
[06:02:22] charging straight in there would be
[06:02:23] extremely risky yeah [ __ ] let's go far
[06:02:25] more
[06:02:28] in on our enemy Navia here you are what
[06:02:31] the [ __ ] I've been looking for you I
[06:02:34] found solid proof so you can charge into
[06:02:36] your enemy watch
[06:02:38] yeah news came from irenaeus just after
[06:02:41] you left we've got another trial on our
[06:02:44] hands what wasn't that place built
[06:02:46] specifically for holding trials it's
[06:02:48] about you
[06:02:51] I know I know but they said the person
[06:02:53] they're putting on trial is a Harbinger
[06:02:55] called tartar wait I forgot trials in
[06:02:57] this Quest wait I just remembered
[06:03:00] oh [ __ ]
[06:03:03] what is that someone you know yeah we're
[06:03:07] kind of close I mean we know him
[06:03:10] maybe even a little too well
[06:03:12] well
[06:03:13] he's been accused of being the true
[06:03:15] culprit behind no he's not bro
[06:03:19] it's absurd don't you think
[06:03:26] that's what I thought was strange about
[06:03:28] it so he's a criminal but like the the
[06:03:30] good kind like like at least he looks
[06:03:33] good then it'll be next to Impossible
[06:03:34] he's pretty he has a brother uh two sir
[06:03:38] you know two sir because they'll think
[06:03:40] they've already found the culture
[06:03:43] yeah
[06:03:44] and it'll be a lot harder than to clear
[06:03:46] also yeah he's Mr he's [ __ ] Mr
[06:03:48] worldwide Mr International he's [ __ ]
[06:03:51] pit bull there's no way he's he's

[06:04:06] what do you mean
[06:04:07] you can go to Aaron yes while I go
[06:04:10] investigate that place I'm confident in
[06:04:12] my combat abilities
[06:04:14] just as expected of my partner since
[06:04:17] this is a trial about the serial
[06:04:19] disappearances case the culprit's
[06:04:21] attention will be focused on arenais
[06:04:23] leaving his home base wide open
[06:04:27] you're right this is our best
[06:04:29] opportunity all right then let's do this
[06:04:33] oh I won't have any chance of making
[06:04:35] that charge stick though unless we find
[06:04:37] more evidence it'll be up to you to make
[06:04:40] it back in time and hand the decisive
[06:04:42] evidence
[06:04:45] not anchor the like the the Sailor the
[06:04:47] sale
[06:04:50] I'm ready
[06:04:53] oh silver when did you two get here we
[06:04:57] heard that you'll be leaving for a song

[06:06:24] one
[06:06:25] so this
[06:06:30] is so big you're right an important
[06:06:32] place like true
[06:06:34] different okay my bad
[06:06:39] meanwhile inside the Opera epicles
[06:06:49] it would appear that I must repeat my
[06:06:51] question again oh no oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh
[06:06:56] [ __ ] serial disappearances case
[06:06:59] to be perfectly honest I don't
[06:07:02] understand your country's complicated
[06:07:03] court system or the reason why I'm being
[06:07:06] charged with something I've never used
[06:07:07] true who the [ __ ] accused them however
[06:07:09] what a child do did hear that that
[06:07:11] people who have been charged can choose
[06:07:12] to protect oh God he's going to Eagle
[06:07:14] fight them is that right
[06:07:16] in which case as long as I accept the
[06:07:19] charge
[06:07:20] I can have an all a fight with that
[06:07:22] champion dual 's clorend right
[06:07:25] I've got to admit that's one of the most
[06:07:27] enticing offers I've ever received dude
[06:07:29] he just wants to fight her when I
[06:07:31] privately sparred with her last time she
[06:07:33] was obviously holding back
[06:07:35] hey
[06:07:41] [Music]
[06:07:44] Bruno you wouldn't get it don't worry
[06:07:45] about it just just it's okay like don't
[06:07:47] worry about it
[06:07:49] oh sounds like the hydro archon wants to
[06:07:52] lecture me on John is also fine man
[06:07:55] he's only using a bow to practice
[06:07:58] the kind of student that learns best In
[06:08:00] the Heat of battle
[06:08:02] [Music]
[06:08:03] dude why does Frida talk all this [ __ ]
[06:08:05] but can't fight
[06:08:09] alas it would appear that communication
[06:08:11] with the defendant is going poorly we
[06:08:14] have made very little progress in that
[06:08:17] case let me explain everything from the
[06:08:19] very beginning again
[06:08:20] the goal of this trial is to determine
[06:08:23] the culprit behind the serial
[06:08:24] disappearances case
[06:08:27] here did Farina online so I thought it
[06:08:30] must be a [ __ ] Menace
[06:08:33] you don't want to be in a lobby with her
[06:08:41] Ina if
[06:08:44] Steve yeah you don't want to [ __ ] a
[06:08:47] three and of course you were able to
[06:08:48] provide the court with the key
[06:08:49] eyewitness
[06:08:51] but that was an exception rather than
[06:08:53] standard Port protocol I can very well
[06:08:56] charge you with contempt of court for
[06:08:58] your interjections oh please did you
[06:09:02] ever think I had any respect for this
[06:09:04] place's pointless theatrics
[06:09:06] no
[06:09:07] we can put the discussion aside for now
[06:09:10] I'm not here to argue with you I'm here
[06:09:13] to charge the true culprit behind the
[06:09:15] serial disappearances case
[06:09:16] and if my charges prove true then
[06:09:19] tartaglia here will be proven innocent
[06:09:21] by default correct
[06:09:23] W Navia a young lady has charged in and
[06:09:26] offered to clear my name how fascinating
[06:09:29] well I'd gotten half bored to death by
[06:09:32] all these rules [ __ ] trials anyway so
[06:09:35] I'll take you up on that offer
[06:09:36] so your honor is there nothing else for
[06:09:39] me to do now
[06:09:40] you may take a seat for now in the
[06:09:42] audience but that doesn't mean the
[06:09:44] suspicions against you have been lifted
[06:09:48] now then miss Navia who is the person
[06:09:51] you would like to charge instead
[06:09:54] that person
[06:09:57] oh
[06:10:01] well it's the person that we said it was
[06:10:03] sauce right Marcel
[06:10:05] uh
[06:10:07] yeah I think it's still Marshall
[06:10:11] I mean his name does rhyme with parcel
[06:10:13] the head of head so that already Is Us
[06:10:18] [Music]
[06:10:23] store organization oh is this going to
[06:10:26] be a friends the enemies type situation
[06:10:28] okay please let me remind you miss Nadia
[06:10:31] dude you look so [ __ ] sick he's an
[06:10:33] incredibly serious matter committing to
[06:10:35] the charge also means taking on the
[06:10:37] legal responsibilities associated with
[06:10:39] it
[06:10:40] if the charge fails depending on the
[06:10:42] circumstances you may also be charged
[06:10:45] with the crime of making a false
[06:10:47] accusation yes I do in that case I
[06:10:51] declare the charge to be valid Miss
[06:10:53] Navia and attorneys please take your
[06:10:54] places on the court
[06:10:58] members of the guards please he's
[06:11:01] beautiful and he's probably a dragon so
[06:11:03] that's a double double w one more you
[06:11:06] get a [ __ ] website www.fucking
[06:11:09] I'm not gonna say it they'll get clipped
[06:11:10] I'll behave myself you will not require
[06:11:12] an attorney I'll behave myself
[06:11:15] I don't want to say anything sauce in a
[06:11:16] made outfit so we're gonna be normal
[06:11:17] today so quickly I still haven't figured
[06:11:20] out what's going on
[06:11:21] I think an attorney won't be necessary
[06:11:23] this is probably just a misunderstanding
[06:11:25] between shut the [ __ ] up Marshall very
[06:11:28] well in that case since both sides have
[06:11:30] now arrived Miss Navia please present
[06:11:33] your charges I would like to take
[06:11:35] everyone back to three years ago to the
[06:11:37] case of callous no one remembers that
[06:11:40] case I'm sorry Navia I like I love you
[06:11:41] Navia but nobody remembers that in that
[06:11:43] case
[06:11:45] the serial disappearances case
[06:11:47] Navia do you really think that I was the
[06:11:50] one who killed your father
[06:11:52] come on why would I do that kallus was
[06:11:55] my benefactor and remember both you and
[06:11:57] I only ran to the scene when we heard
[06:11:59] the sound of a gun
[06:12:01] if that's enough to make me a suspect
[06:12:03] wouldn't that make everyone at that
[06:12:04] banquet a suspect as well
[06:12:06] I I think there's no point in getting
[06:12:10] into the specifics right now the
[06:12:13] audience doesn't even have the big
[06:12:14] picture yet even I'm
[06:12:17] struggling to remember some details of
[06:12:21] that case
[06:12:22] exactly correct your honor I must
[06:12:25] refresh everyone's memory about that
[06:12:27] case before I can explain my charge and
[06:12:29] reasoning I see in which case I will
[06:12:33] recount the findings about that case as
[06:12:34] originally recorded by Maison
[06:12:36] guardianage
[06:12:41] the day of the murder Spina Duro Sula
[06:12:44] hosted a large banquet in a Countryside
[06:12:46] estate owned by the conferee of Cabrio
[06:12:52] okay
[06:12:55] during the banquet all attending guests
[06:12:57] heard two gunshots from the courtyard
[06:12:59] yeah that's true when the guests arrived
[06:13:01] at the scene they found the primary
[06:13:03] suspect callus holding a gun while his
[06:13:06] acquaintance Jacques laid dead from a
[06:13:08] gunshot wound
[06:13:12] the guards investigation did not recover
[06:13:14] any other firearms from the scene as a
[06:13:17] result they concluded that the suspect's
[06:13:18] first shot must have missed while the
[06:13:20] second must have taken Jacques life
[06:13:23] not true
[06:13:25] probably two people are dead the suspect
[06:13:27] did not dispute this conclusion and also
[06:13:29] declined to defend himself no one misses
[06:13:31] in a piece of fiction ever he chose to
[06:13:33] prove his innocence through a duel
[06:13:42] okay callus was defeated by Champion
[06:13:45] duelist clarend in the ensuing duel and
[06:13:48] soon succumbed to the injuries
[06:13:52] these are the known facts about the case
[06:13:58] honestly you're right I'm sorry now that
[06:14:00] I hear you say it I'm on your side again
[06:14:12] was shot and turned by my father when my
[06:14:15] father sees the gun from him after that
[06:14:17] the true culprit turned the third person
[06:14:19] into water erasing all traces of him
[06:14:23] from the scene
[06:14:24] thank you for the summary your honor of
[06:14:28] course the guard's conclusion appeared
[06:14:30] quite sensible to us at the time
[06:14:32] however we should revisit the case now
[06:14:35] that we've gained new information about
[06:14:37] the abilities of water from the
[06:14:38] primordial sea
[06:14:41] what the again oh we're repeating okay
[06:14:45] okay
[06:14:46] what are you wearing I lost a bet
[06:14:49] but if you follow that would be
[06:14:50] appreciated because then it's like oh at
[06:14:51] least I got
[06:14:52] I'm sorry I'm sorry you could also no no
[06:14:55] I'll shut up I'm sorry oh
[06:14:59] okay
[06:15:00] uh the banquet uh Spinners are those
[06:15:02] little large banquet
[06:15:04] at a state owned by the conference
[06:15:07] oh
[06:15:09] um
[06:15:13] okay
[06:15:17] two gunshots
[06:15:20] it is not a callus
[06:15:22] kallus did not carry a gun no no sorry
[06:15:25] I'll be I'll be smart I'll be smart I'll
[06:15:27] be smart I won't [ __ ] up I won't [ __ ] up
[06:15:28] I promise no more mistakes no more
[06:15:30] mistakes let me think let me read let me
[06:15:32] cook no more mistakes there will be zero
[06:15:34] mistakes let me read no mistakes watch
[06:15:35] I'm gonna read ready ready okay
[06:15:39] um the greatest Invaders not recover any
[06:15:40] other firearms from the scene as a
[06:15:42] result the first shot must have missed
[06:15:43] and the second must have taken Jack's
[06:15:45] life
[06:15:48] hmm
[06:15:50] uh can we conclude only one person who
[06:15:53] can have a large amount of cardamax
[06:15:55] definitely believe that he had uh
[06:15:58] struggled greatly with the order to kill
[06:15:59] callus
[06:16:07] I could mention that here because there
[06:16:09] could be like a little bit of a yes sir
[06:16:11] okay in
[06:16:18] that okay if we don't count the first
[06:16:20] guess we're wanna know the true culprit
[06:16:22] had already considered this possibility
[06:16:24] and had wanna know if we don't count the
[06:16:26] first one
[06:16:29] okay
[06:16:31] uh seen the crime
[06:16:34] the cows did not bring a gun with him
[06:16:37] moreover that's a nice word details of
[06:16:39] the case Point towards the existence of
[06:16:41] a third party
[06:16:46] muscle
[06:16:48] clothing of an unknown person
[06:16:53] assassin first shot shock then turn to
[06:16:56] shoot callus only for kallus to wrestle
[06:16:58] the gun from him and kill him instead
[06:17:02] reconstruction of events
[06:17:05] as a result they concluded that the
[06:17:07] suspect's first shot must have missed
[06:17:09] and the second one must have taken
[06:17:11] Jack's life no no no
[06:17:17] callous didn't even have a gun
[06:17:20] could be this too no no the solve this
[06:17:22] for this uh wait no never mind
[06:17:28] he didn't even have a gun your order
[06:17:35] someone was dissolved someone was
[06:17:36] dissolved someone was dissolved someone
[06:17:38] was dissolved
[06:17:41] the swords once believed they were used
[06:17:42] by Jacques as a costume to disguise
[06:17:44] himself but true it is clear that the
[06:17:47] clothes were proof that there was a
[06:17:48] third person at the scene and that they
[06:17:50] were turned into water after committing
[06:17:53] the murder since it was raining that day
[06:17:55] the culprit was confident that they
[06:17:57] could use the rain to wash away all
[06:17:59] traces of their dissolved accomplice
[06:18:02] sheesh not even bad not even bad culprit
[06:18:05] cause the hired assassin to dissolve
[06:18:07] into water leading everyone to believe
[06:18:09] kallus was responsible for Jacques
[06:18:12] murder
[06:18:14] true
[06:18:17] true
[06:18:19] successful refutation
[06:18:27] that's what happened wait you're telling
[06:18:30] me something as dangerous as what a
[06:18:33] great Theory it also explains calluses
[06:18:35] and Jacques respective motives bro I
[06:18:37] literally calls you guilty shoot each
[06:18:38] other after all Mr Marcel you are the
[06:18:41] one being charged with the crime you
[06:18:43] should provide it what a great Theory ah
[06:18:48] with everything Navi is just
[06:18:50] fact there was nothing in Her speech
[06:18:52] that directly implicated me then may I
[06:18:55] ask some questions
[06:18:56] in my opinion of course Serena what's up
[06:19:01] one
[06:19:03] have the evidence to back up your claims
[06:19:07] I'm afraid not at least not at this very
[06:19:11] moment
[06:19:13] if you don't have any evidence who are
[06:19:16] you you don't have a name you may not
[06:19:18] have the evidence with me but I know
[06:19:20] where I could go you're [ __ ] yellow
[06:19:22] bracelet thing doesn't even burn that
[06:19:24] doesn't even match your outfit go change
[06:19:25] I'm missing around the same time
[06:19:28] find a match
[06:19:30] considering the serial disappearance's
[06:19:32] case the guards probably kept careful
[06:19:34] records of all missing persons from
[06:19:36] around that time regardless of age or
[06:19:39] gender that makes sense to me
[06:19:42] you're on your valet I would consider
[06:19:44] this to be a reasonable investigative
[06:19:47] Direction
[06:19:48] huh
[06:19:49] why do I feel like farina's acting a
[06:19:52] little differently today maybe she's
[06:19:54] scared of embarrassing herself again
[06:19:55] true alternatively
[06:20:01] she learned
[06:20:03] W Farina
[06:20:05] duel if the truth is indeed as you
[06:20:09] described then why didn't Mr callous
[06:20:13] explain himself in court
[06:20:15] if he had testified that a person had
[06:20:18] been dissolved he could have at least
[06:20:20] mounted a defense
[06:20:22] I thought about this too and the answer
[06:20:25] is actually pretty simple
[06:20:27] he felt there were things that were more
[06:20:29] important to him the dissolving power of
[06:20:32] water from the primordial sea is an
[06:20:35] important secret for the true culprit of
[06:20:36] the serial disappearances case true my
[06:20:39] father could have exposed it for all to
[06:20:41] see but he chose to take it to the Grave
[06:20:44] Because of You Spina de rosula was in
[06:20:46] Dire Straits and his reputation had
[06:20:49] already been shattered he had no
[06:20:51] guarantee that going forward with the
[06:20:53] truth would allow the culprit to be
[06:20:55] brought to Justice what was certain
[06:20:57] however was that it would paint a
[06:20:59] gigantic Target on my back
[06:21:02] Moss once told me that the moiselle had
[06:21:05] already been selected as the next Target
[06:21:07] of the serial disappearance oh this
[06:21:08] guy's helpful
[06:21:10] no if the secret had gotten out the
[06:21:13] culprit would have fought an all-out war
[06:21:15] with aspina right there and then I
[06:21:18] wouldn't have been the only one in
[06:21:19] danger all of us would have stood to
[06:21:21] lose our lives of course the guards
[06:21:24] might eventually figure out the truth of
[06:21:26] the matter and determined that we were
[06:21:28] in the right
[06:21:29] but what good would that do how can a
[06:21:32] hollow verdict protect anyone had this
[06:21:35] opera house ever given my father any
[06:21:38] kind of confidence in its brand of
[06:21:40] Justice Spina derosula did even if we
[06:21:42] managed to prove child's innocence he's
[06:21:44] gonna be pissed he just lost a fight we
[06:21:46] retain the ability to deter our
[06:21:48] opponents and continue the stalemate I
[06:21:51] was able to become spinadiro sula's
[06:21:53] president which made me harder to Target
[06:21:55] as well as giving me more time to grow
[06:21:57] and learn
[06:21:58] and once I have figured out the truth
[06:22:00] and stepped up to the challenge I will
[06:22:03] do what this Opera House cannot and
[06:22:06] restore my father's truth and honor back
[06:22:08] to him
[06:22:09] so you mean to say your father intended
[06:22:14] to die in the duelist's ring yes that's
[06:22:17] right
[06:22:19] do you have any proof no of course oh
[06:22:22] okay
[06:22:23] all you need is to ask his opponent
[06:22:26] clarand
[06:22:28] Bob he's dragging her into this I don't
[06:22:31] need your apology your guilt or your
[06:22:34] support from the Shadows you don't have
[06:22:36] to do anything for my sake but since he
[06:22:39] entrusted his will to you clarand you
[06:22:41] should tell us the truth about his
[06:22:43] sacrifice
[06:22:44] um
[06:22:45] so oh my God during the duel did you
[06:22:48] believe that kallus was intending I need
[06:22:51] to pull for every character in this
[06:22:52] courtroom
[06:22:55] I did
[06:22:56] as a champion duelist I've fought many
[06:22:59] battles and taken a countless number of
[06:23:01] Dishonored lives
[06:23:03] in my line of work
[06:23:04] I've seen all kinds of people give their
[06:23:06] all for the faintest hope to continue
[06:23:08] living
[06:23:10] some were determined others passionate
[06:23:13] and some even Manic and twisted Just One
[06:23:17] Look and I can tell if a duelist is
[06:23:19] hoping to live or if they're looking to
[06:23:21] die
[06:23:22] I hereby swear on my name and honor as a
[06:23:25] champion duelist that Mr callous never
[06:23:28] intended to leave the ring alive
[06:23:32] since that's your testimony I have no
[06:23:36] more questions it appears there really
[06:23:38] are good grounds to reopen this case
[06:23:41] I concur however I concur you still have
[06:23:45] not explained the link between your
[06:23:46] father's case and the serial
[06:23:47] disappearances case right what she said
[06:23:51] was fascinating but kind of beside the
[06:23:53] point
[06:23:54] wait weren't they just talking about the
[06:23:56] serial disappearances case what are why
[06:23:59] are we listening to these NPCs man I've
[06:24:01] connected via a matter of timing
[06:24:05] in my father's case the culprit intended
[06:24:08] to kill bullshock and kallus as a result
[06:24:11] they plan to act after hearing two
[06:24:13] gunshots
[06:24:15] and at the end of Lenny's trial the
[06:24:17] culprit also only dissolved the victim
[06:24:19] in front of everyone because they
[06:24:21] realized they were at risk of being
[06:24:23] identified
[06:24:24] the culprit could only time their
[06:24:26] actions so precisely if they were
[06:24:29] already at the scene
[06:24:31] coincidentally Marcel attended that is
[06:24:34] suspicious Marcel that is hey that is a
[06:24:37] little so that's why you suspected me
[06:24:41] even after hearing your reasoning I
[06:24:43] still can't help but find it a little
[06:24:45] Preposterous
[06:24:47] you've always been an impulsive and
[06:24:49] sentimental child Navia it's one of your
[06:24:51] most endearing traits shut the [ __ ] up
[06:24:53] Marshall
[06:24:54] no need to appeal to Panthers I will try
[06:24:58] to refute your points one by one but
[06:25:00] even if everything you just said was
[06:25:02] true can you prove that I was the only
[06:25:04] person present at both events
[06:25:08] on top of that does a person have to be
[06:25:10] physically present to control the timing
[06:25:12] can't someone remotely monitor the place
[06:25:19] I don't know what she can say to that
[06:25:22] I know that even with that you might
[06:25:24] still think you can reduce the list of
[06:25:25] suspects with some further
[06:25:27] investigations until I am the only one
[06:25:29] left on the list alas who won't feel at
[06:25:33] least a little hurt by an accusation of
[06:25:35] murder from a girl you see as your own
[06:25:37] daughter
[06:25:38] but if I were to dismiss this completely
[06:25:40] you'd also think I'm not being
[06:25:41] considerate of your feelings ah well let
[06:25:44] Uncle Marcel teach you another lesson
[06:25:47] do you know what the biggest flaw in
[06:25:49] your reasoning is oh [ __ ] he's cooking a
[06:25:51] little who's you're gonna tell me
[06:25:52] anyways it's timing again
[06:25:55] I'm a businessman by trade from that
[06:25:57] standpoint there's no reason for me to
[06:25:59] kidnap young women it's a high risk
[06:26:01] action with nothing to gain
[06:26:03] in addition I Left My Home In snesh Naya
[06:26:06] when I was young to come to poisson and
[06:26:08] work in some trade my business only
[06:26:10] thrived when I received callus paper is
[06:26:12] not cooking actually what the
[06:26:14] disappearances began before I ever
[06:26:16] stepped foot in Fontaine
[06:26:20] do apologize to Marcel this was my
[06:26:23] mistake
[06:26:24] no
[06:26:25] it's not your fault
[06:26:27] sure he had come prepared is there
[06:26:29] anything else you'd like to say would
[06:26:32] you like to check the date of my first
[06:26:33] business license against the first known
[06:26:35] case of the serial disappearances
[06:26:38] you can also take a look at my border
[06:26:40] entry records what if it started with
[06:26:42] someone else and then he picked it out
[06:26:43] for the first time
[06:26:46] could those records and testimonies do
[06:26:48] something to appease the Unspeakable
[06:26:50] anguish in your heart
[06:26:52] seems like she got the wrong guy
[06:26:54] at this rate Navi will be convicted for
[06:26:57] falsely accusing him he seems a little
[06:27:00] superpowered job of dissecting your
[06:27:01] father's feelings it seems like it seems
[06:27:03] like it seems like you're like he saw us
[06:27:04] and then he overly explains everything
[06:27:06] and then you execute him anyways and he
[06:27:07] was the Imposter and then he's like yeah
[06:27:09] but he didn't know why I was like I
[06:27:10] don't care you're dead and then minus
[06:27:12] one imposter and then you still win
[06:27:15] become more rational collected and
[06:27:17] conscientious instead of dwelling only
[06:27:19] on your own feelings
[06:27:22] once you've learned to be more
[06:27:23] considerate of others feelings and to
[06:27:25] stop rushing headlong into things you'd
[06:27:27] have met most of his expectations then
[06:27:30] what are you talking about your name
[06:27:32] rhymes with parcel and you're pissed
[06:27:33] about it that's not my fault the biggest
[06:27:36] difference between me and the rest of
[06:27:38] the victims is that I still have the
[06:27:40] ability to search for the truth while
[06:27:42] that same agency has long been taken
[06:27:45] from then the people whose families were
[06:27:47] destroyed by synth abuse the people who
[06:27:49] lost their loved ones to the serial
[06:27:51] disappearances and the people who
[06:27:53] suffered tragic ends due to their sense
[06:27:55] of justice many people's images are
[06:27:58] flashing before my eyes
[06:28:06] do you see Marcel is it a man named
[06:28:14] oh so you do know that name
[06:28:17] I'm merely surprised you'd suddenly say
[06:28:20] the name of someone I've never even
[06:28:22] heard of
[06:28:23] I was waiting for you to say that
[06:28:25] because I saw you kissing him oh never
[06:28:28] mind
[06:28:29] oh oh oh oh oh she cooked she cooked she
[06:28:33] cooked

[06:36:34] wait a second
[06:36:38] you're

[06:36:53] the goal of the researcher is to save
[06:36:55] his lover a woman called Vina vinaire
[06:36:58] who was dissolved
[06:37:00] no way it's him
[06:37:05] do you really think he'd be able to dude
[06:37:14] it was [ __ ] vasher the whole time
[06:37:18] the name you heard by the fountain
[06:37:21] thought he was an eyewitness and the
[06:37:23] serial disappearances case

[06:38:20] damn that is [ __ ]
[06:38:25] done the last time there's like a
[06:38:26] researcher like that it was [ __ ] the
[06:38:28] tanar request and it was just like we
[06:38:29] got a q robot and then the robot was you
[06:38:31] know he's cool
[06:38:32] meanwhile this
[06:38:35] that must be water from the primordial
[06:38:36] see
[06:38:40] yeah and that special water is the main
[06:38:42] ingredient
[06:38:44] with normal water you'll get sense but
[06:38:47] the pure stuff can dissolve this little
[06:38:49] subscribe
[06:38:51] it's on this incriminating evidence
[06:38:55] dumb
[06:38:57] down that is [ __ ]
[06:39:08] callous
[06:39:10] navia's father
[06:39:12] oh this seems to be an investigation
[06:39:14] report on him
[06:39:17] um
[06:39:18] [Music]
[06:39:20] yep it's about finding someone to
[06:39:22] assassinate shocking callus because of a
[06:39:25] lack of confidence that Jack himself
[06:39:27] would go through with it
[06:39:28] and prove the existence of the third
[06:39:30] person right yep
[06:39:33] hmm
[06:39:34] we still have not determined the exact
[06:39:37] content of the key information callus
[06:39:39] has passed on to certain menthy old dogs
[06:39:41] a real menace to deal with even if he
[06:39:44] abides by the promise he's made to us he
[06:39:47] will still have the upper hand okay he
[06:39:50] can act whenever he wants to make our
[06:39:52] lives miserable I concur that's [ __ ]
[06:39:58] he won't Declare War as long as we don't
[06:40:01] touch Navia oh seems like we've got a
[06:40:04] bunch of Correspondence between the
[06:40:06] higher-ups
[06:40:11] okay
[06:40:20] wait did I do this I did
[06:40:31] minus 35k dude there's been like three
[06:40:34] outer deals I didn't do any of them

[06:40:42] trying to scam I just don't want to run
[06:40:44] okay we'll do one we'll do one we'll do
[06:40:47] one but you can dodge it by solving or
[06:40:50] you can just you can just write a short
[06:40:51] story on what your ad was and I'll be
[06:40:52] like oh cool thanks for I'm sorry it's

[06:41:35] let's keep looking
[06:41:36] yeah I don't know why this is black it's
[06:41:38] kind of a monkey I mean I guess because
[06:41:39] it's like poison but still mango

[06:43:13] wait wait Marcel's pretty old oh has
[06:43:18] this case been going on for so long that
[06:43:20] he's Foshay and veneer's grown son
[06:43:25] oh what
[06:43:33] wait then why are we charging him if
[06:43:34] it's just his son like isn't his dad the
[06:43:36] criminal
[06:43:38] I mean maybe he's helping I don't know
[06:43:39] but
[06:43:44] I mean I guess we cooked
[06:43:49] Marcel is it a man named vashay
[06:43:54] oh so you do know that name he is very
[06:43:57] old though so maybe it is him surprise
[06:43:59] you'd suddenly but he just changed his
[06:44:01] name to what he wanted the sun to be
[06:44:02] because the wife died before she could
[06:44:04] give birth
[06:44:05] [Music]
[06:44:06] ah as expected of my partner I just knew
[06:44:10] you'd return in the next just how often
[06:44:12] do you intend to I mean he's all those
[06:44:14] [ __ ] there's no way that's the son of a
[06:44:16] kill like yeah there's no way so it has
[06:44:18] to be him
[06:44:19] I expect they've found the crucial
[06:44:21] evidence
[06:44:25] you said you've never heard of vasher
[06:44:29] however
[06:44:33] uh I mean this is the most important one
[06:44:35] but I don't know if
[06:44:39] I mean I guess
[06:44:44] but the truth of it Marcel let me
[06:44:46] talking
[06:44:48] Jay
[06:44:50] huh
[06:44:52] we've investigated
[06:44:57] was dissolved you kept abducting me
[06:45:00] young women to experiment on the hopes
[06:45:02] of bringing her back to you um
[06:45:11] so that's it
[06:45:12] even the villains in Opera performances
[06:45:15] rarely go that far
[06:45:17] and with that Marcel's motive has now
[06:45:21] been established this information
[06:45:23] regarding your past also dismantles your
[06:45:26] prior timing defense
[06:45:28] well Marcel do you know where you went
[06:45:31] wrong
[06:45:32] you fixated your game that passed away
[06:45:36] instead of paying attention to the
[06:45:38] living people around you
[06:45:40] so you never noticed how we changed or
[06:45:43] how we grew as individuals
[06:45:45] you also never understood boss's real
[06:45:48] expectations for his daughter
[06:45:50] or our determination to see things
[06:45:52] through
[06:45:54] your determination
[06:45:56] [Laughter]
[06:45:59] Mr Marcel please speak up now if you
[06:46:01] would like to defend yourself otherwise
[06:46:04] the trial will move on to the next stage
[06:46:06] you think do you really think I wanted
[06:46:09] to do any of this no one cares no one
[06:46:12] asked plus rebozo attention to you
[06:46:16] plus no [ __ ]
[06:46:18] ever empathize with my pain ever known
[06:46:22] how it feels to watch the love of your
[06:46:24] life does no no wife no kids
[06:46:27] no friends no one even believed me all
[06:46:32] those decades ago even the officers from
[06:46:34] the Maison Guardian Ash were laughing at
[06:46:36] me
[06:46:37] said there's no way a human being can
[06:46:40] turn into water so I must have gone mad
[06:46:42] from grief
[06:46:43] vineyard's death was brushed Away by all
[06:46:46] of you as if it didn't matter at all
[06:46:48] well now you know don't you
[06:46:52] ha
[06:46:53] well it's too late now all those who
[06:46:57] were dissolved are gone forever
[06:47:00] you only have yourselves to blame
[06:47:02] you set up this ornate Opera House in
[06:47:04] pursuit of your so-called Justice your
[06:47:07] beloved drama
[06:47:09] while turning a blind eye to the
[06:47:11] suffering of the people
[06:47:13] the year is dead together
[06:47:19] wherever she goes I will follow
[06:47:23] but I'm not from this blasted place
[06:47:27] so I can't be dissolved no matter what I
[06:47:30] do
[06:47:32] this doesn't even make sense like
[06:47:38] is he a buffed I don't know if you're
[06:47:40] okay if it's like okay okay I watched
[06:47:43] like Dracula right and he was like he

[06:47:49] they killed her so I'm gonna kill all
[06:47:50] the humans it's like it's [ __ ] up but

[06:48:14] ocean what choice do I have but to try
[06:48:17] to bring I guess he doesn't know that
[06:48:18] but still I do that trying to bring her
[06:48:20] back yeah but got a cursed callous still
[06:48:24] got the best
[06:48:27] higher life living on pins and needles
[06:48:31] to get stuck by his daughter at the very
[06:48:34] end
[06:48:34] [Laughter]
[06:48:38] the suspect is exhibiting signs of
[06:48:40] mental distress guards please restrain
[06:48:42] him don't touch me
[06:48:45] don't get anybody clear me
[06:48:53] then yeah then yeah
[06:48:57] I don't think badly of me at this point
[06:49:01] the verdict of this trial is clear with
[06:49:03] Mr Marcel's conviction
[06:49:07] no longer have any basis bum fine by me
[06:49:10] I was in a bad mood but after a show
[06:49:13] like that I'm actually almost a fight
[06:49:16] good traveler please submit all the
[06:49:19] evidence you have collected to the
[06:49:20] guards so that I might review and
[06:49:22] summarize the truth behind the serial
[06:49:23] disappearances case
[06:49:28] the man now known as Marcel was
[06:49:30] originally named varshay and worked as
[06:49:33] an adventurer with his partner and lover
[06:49:34] vigner
[06:49:36] during an underwater Expedition vinyere
[06:49:39] accidentally came into contact with
[06:49:40] water from the primordial sea and was
[06:49:42] dissolved actually as a result
[06:49:46] of the primordial water's existence
[06:49:48] through the work of others and began to
[06:49:50] kidnap young women for research with a
[06:49:53] goal of discovering a method to restore
[06:49:55] vinyere back to life
[06:49:57] to cover his tracks he invented the new
[06:49:59] Alias of Marcel and began to operate a
[06:50:02] business in poisson
[06:50:07] okay
[06:50:08] during the course of his research Marche
[06:50:11] discovered that a diluted concoction of
[06:50:13] water from the primordial sea can induce
[06:50:15] feelings of euphoria and began to
[06:50:18] manufacture in markets synth however as
[06:50:21] he accumulated wealth to fund his
[06:50:23] continued research and expanded the
[06:50:25] scope wait what she dissolved from
[06:50:27] putting her hand in water but drinking a
[06:50:29] little bit of it's fine I mean I know
[06:50:30] it's diluted but
[06:50:32] there's no way she like jumped into the
[06:50:34] sea like no way his wife just jumped in
[06:50:36] it didn't she dissolved from just like
[06:50:39] I don't know whatever
[06:50:43] how did they solve her whole body she
[06:50:44] touched it yeah but wouldn't it like
[06:50:46] dissolve her hand it just killed all
[06:50:47] dissolved all over
[06:50:51] all right guys but if it's that strong
[06:50:54] how can you even dissolve any of it I
[06:50:55] guess you'd put like a millimeter leader
[06:50:58] after exchanging blue I don't know for
[06:51:01] many years while she decided to
[06:51:03] assassinate their president maybe she
[06:51:05] fell in it
[06:51:07] although the assassination did not go as
[06:51:09] vashay expected he was able to turn
[06:51:11] kallus into the murder suspect by
[06:51:13] dissolving the Assassin he sent to the
[06:51:16] scene
[06:51:16] and just recently vashay attempted to
[06:51:19] frame Linney as the culprit of the
[06:51:21] serial discipline how dare you using a
[06:51:23] similar method however his attempt to
[06:51:26] frame Lenny failed and the power of
[06:51:28] water from the primordial sea became
[06:51:30] public knowledge Charles is [ __ ]
[06:51:31] standing there I'm covering them like
[06:51:33] he's [ __ ] standing that he was
[06:51:35] eventually successfully charged in court
[06:51:37] thus concludes the enigmatic history of
[06:51:40] the serial disappearances child does not
[06:51:42] give a [ __ ] about this he's like bro
[06:51:44] just let me out or let me fight [ __ ]

[06:51:50] charges against Mr Dashay

[06:52:03] that's a three-star unlucky
[06:52:07] according to the Judgment of the
[06:52:09] oratories mechanic Denalis Cardinal Mr
[06:52:12] varshay is guilty down
[06:52:19] away
[06:52:21] thanks Farina

[06:53:08] well now hasn't this been a most
[06:53:10] delicious piece of drama the villain has
[06:53:13] been caught justice has been served past
[06:53:15] wrongs have been right child shut the
[06:53:17] [ __ ] up man now's not the time since
[06:53:20] it's been such a great show I'll just
[06:53:22] let the false accusations against me
[06:53:24] slide either way I've still got some
[06:53:27] business to attend to so if you'll
[06:53:29] accept remember what I said about the
[06:53:30] remember I said about trailers ruining
[06:53:32] the movies for me I feel like the
[06:53:34] quest's about to end but in the in the
[06:53:35] in the preview 4.0 stream we saw child
[06:53:37] fighting so something's gonna happen and
[06:53:39] I [ __ ] hate that I know this please
[06:53:41] wait just one moment yeah they're gonna
[06:53:44] whip their [ __ ] out yep uh what now
[06:53:46] none of this has anything to do with me
[06:53:49] according to court protocol since this
[06:53:51] trial was initiated due to a charge
[06:53:53] against you a verdict must also be made
[06:53:56] regarding the initial charge before one
[06:53:58] trial can conclude okay come on is this
[06:54:01] really necessary haven't you already
[06:54:03] caught the real criminal isn't it time
[06:54:06] for Side characters like me to exit
[06:54:08] stage left
[06:54:10] please respect the laws of Fontaine this
[06:54:13] has always been the rule all right all
[06:54:16] right but this sure is a lot of hassle
[06:54:17] all I need to do is stand over there
[06:54:19] right
[06:54:20] let's just get this over with
[06:54:24] through evidence presented in the public
[06:54:26] trial that was just held it has been
[06:54:28] established that Mr top taglia has no
[06:54:30] direct connection to the serial
[06:54:31] disappearance's case however the guilty
[06:54:33] party identified and thus it is logical
[06:54:36] to suppose Mr tataglia Is Not Innocent
[06:54:39] of any charge but all good
[06:54:41] oh yeah the Orange is going to be like
[06:54:43] guilty
[06:54:46] the criminal but he did nothing wrong
[06:54:47] now does this dude he's changed people
[06:54:50] can change people can change people can
[06:54:54] change
[06:54:55] his [ __ ] face
[06:54:57] hey hey that's not funny
[06:55:00] didn't you just say I'm supposed to be
[06:55:02] innocent
[06:55:05] what's with this verdict is your Justice
[06:55:07] machine you just did a bit of oopsies in
[06:55:09] his past this has never happened before
[06:55:11] the Ora Trace he's had a few heated
[06:55:14] moments verdict from the Chief Justice I
[06:55:17] mean have you ever heard of an innocent
[06:55:19] fatoui harbinger
[06:55:21] do you think the oratrice might have
[06:55:23] just convicted him on General principle
[06:55:25] but weren't the charges about the serial
[06:55:27] disappearances case no matter what else
[06:55:29] he's guilty of it shouldn't affect the
[06:55:31] verdict in this true W traveler the
[06:55:34] Judgment of the auratrice mechanics
[06:55:36] Cardinal is by law the final verdict of
[06:55:40] the Court
[06:55:41] right
[06:55:44] Gods please take the suspect into
[06:55:46] custody per Court protocol
[06:55:49] I don't know where they got his ass
[06:55:52] oh oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ]
[06:55:58] so this is how
[06:56:00] Jane
[06:56:01] joke
[06:56:03] I mean Drew alcort you've got your rules
[06:56:07] well I've got mine too
[06:56:15] why is this
[06:56:20] it's the same thing but [ __ ] Electro

[06:56:43] [Music]
[06:56:57] I am sorry if you have been wronged we
[06:57:00] will find the truth
[06:57:02] but the rules of the Court
[06:57:04] he actually got down he sat him down
[06:57:08] what the hell
[06:57:11] [Music]
[06:57:17] he was mid-alt
[06:57:19] [Music]
[06:57:28] know which Holly got [ __ ] one tapped
[06:57:30] this is also the first time I've
[06:57:32] encountered such a situation
[06:57:33] however according to the rules
[06:57:35] established at the conception of
[06:57:37] fontaine's court system the aura
[06:57:39] Teresa's judgment is the final verdict
[06:57:41] of the court all I do is follow Court
[06:57:43] procedure
[06:57:44] as for why the oratories arrived at the
[06:57:46] conclusion it did you should probably
[06:57:48] ask someone more knowledgeable ah I mean
[06:57:51] that was kind of sick but what the [ __ ]
[06:57:53] surely you can let him go [ __ ] the
[06:57:55] machine
[06:58:06] what what does Lady Farina mean by that
[06:58:08] she said she has no idea either but
[06:58:12] that's impossible Serena yeah so are the
[06:58:14] verdicts reliable or not
[06:58:17] she's getting a ratio right now sure ego
[06:58:19] can't handle it she's losing followers
[06:58:22] she's gonna make a YouTuber apology
[06:58:26] she's pulling up the [ __ ] ukulele
[06:58:39] you thought even I had been blindsided

[06:59:25] Ora treats shall never render an
[06:59:28] arbitrary judgment okay if you thought

[07:11:14] narcissist
[07:11:16] the only thing you are not
[07:11:19] has been years beloved
[07:11:22] from the moment your first victim died
[07:11:25] and her Consciousness merged with
[07:11:27] veneers
[07:11:28] um she has had nothing but pure
[07:11:31] paid for you dumb
[07:11:39] no
[07:11:40] yeah
[07:11:42] she can't hate me let me see her please
[07:11:45] have mercy
[07:11:48] you still don't understand
[07:11:51] when I said don't look for me that came
[07:11:55] from the real vinaire
[07:11:57] she really doesn't want to see you
[07:11:59] anymore though but on top of that she
[07:12:03] also said that because it's her final
[07:12:06] drop of pain why didn't Carrie bear turn
[07:12:09] into hilly Troll and not him turn this
[07:12:11] guy make this guy a [ __ ] common chest
[07:12:13] Defender
[07:12:14] she said that because she knew that if
[07:12:17] you did come here
[07:12:19] we will show no mercy to you
[07:12:33] [Laughter]
[07:12:40] later the garden uh the guard found that
[07:12:43] the culprit of the cereals no let me
[07:12:45] read
[07:12:57] I'm just gonna assume he drowned
[07:12:59] deserved very deserved maybe that's
[07:13:01] crying again
[07:13:03] [Music]
[07:13:11] well met partner you know something
[07:13:14] great was going to happen when I woke up
[07:13:16] in such a good mood today yeah the dude
[07:13:18] that the guy drowned he drowned it's a
[07:13:22] pleasure to see you but child's still in
[07:13:24] jail though I mean
[07:13:25] I don't know why but
[07:13:28] I mean he's committed a few war crimes
[07:13:30] but not here so
[07:13:32] oh now that I believe
[07:13:35] I'm easy to work with and I'll spring
[07:13:37] home the bacon who wouldn't treasure
[07:13:39] having a partner like me
[07:13:46] I like the Penguins
[07:13:51] I've been making non-stop trips between
[07:13:53] poisson and the court since then
[07:13:56] everyone from Spina de rosula
[07:13:58] was a memorial for my father
[07:14:01] who never held a memorial when he first
[07:14:02] died since everyone knew that even if we
[07:14:04] held back then oh they're gonna hold on
[07:14:06] now that's awesome this time though
[07:14:09] oh they did okay many people from the
[07:14:12] court all attended wholesome
[07:14:14] it's been the dearest wish of the
[07:14:17] Moselle all along
[07:14:23] my faith in him
[07:14:25] oh by the way I ran into Charlotte just
[07:14:28] after I left the memorial service
[07:14:30] well maybe it'd be more accurate to say
[07:14:34] I knew she would be there
[07:14:36] and there was no that's actually funny
[07:14:37] though we meet [ __ ] we arrive in
[07:14:39] fonten Charlotte's like yeah there's
[07:14:41] this huge case that's been going on for
[07:14:43] like 20 years I want to solve literally
[07:14:44] like two days later we just solved it
[07:14:47] like it's like her life goal we just
[07:14:49] solve it it's like a day thanks Navia
[07:14:54] oh wait we just met what the [ __ ]
[07:14:59] Ed way back when I first became the
[07:15:01] president of the Spina de rosula she was
[07:15:03] all over me wouldn't take no for an
[07:15:05] answer
[07:15:06] I believe the story was called The True
[07:15:09] Heart of Darkness secret tales of the
[07:15:12] Yellow Rose to be fair though it was a
[07:15:16] really flattering feature
[07:15:19] so we've been on pretty good terms ever
[07:15:21] since okay she was trying to lean on our
[07:15:24] friendship to get me to do an exclusive
[07:15:25] piece on the serial disappearances case
[07:15:27] yeah come on man she wants to do it yeah
[07:15:30] she told us about that she's always been
[07:15:33] super interested dude actor he's not out
[07:15:35] chat
[07:15:36] [Music]
[07:15:41] critical evidence that you both sound
[07:15:43] really cool
[07:15:46] now that's another thing to look forward
[07:15:48] to
[07:15:50] will Charlotte
[07:15:52] and in other news
[07:15:54] I also took clarend out for a meal
[07:15:59] sorry there's nothing nothing I don't
[07:16:00] know why I wrote that
[07:16:03] okay what happened
[07:16:05] none of my business but while you were
[07:16:07] investigating vashay's headquarters
[07:16:09] clorand gave testimony on my father's
[07:16:12] behalf it was thanks to her that we were
[07:16:14] able to turn the tide
[07:16:15] I wanted to thank her I mean there's
[07:16:18] also no point in being awkward all the
[07:16:20] time so we took the chance to reconcile
[07:16:23] with each other
[07:16:29] anyway now that the case has finally
[07:16:32] been solved perhaps it will slowly begin
[07:16:34] to fade from them first chamber then
[07:16:37] Harbor now fade that's three I'm sorry
[07:16:39] I'll shut up
[07:16:41] what is it I should pay a visit to my
[07:16:43] father's grave and tell him the truth of
[07:16:45] what happened as well as how it all
[07:16:47] ended and on top of that just how much
[07:16:51] people still look up to him to this day
[07:16:55] that includes me too that Marcel guy's
[07:16:58] so weird we should have stole all this
[07:16:59] [ __ ] Mora man he literally said if
[07:17:01] you want more I will give it to you we
[07:17:02] literally should have taken it
[07:17:05] you only call us money go go [ __ ] go
[07:17:07] take him you don't like it steal it all
[07:17:09] after all without you there might not
[07:17:12] have been such a positive ending and in
[07:17:15] that case
[07:17:17] that cake considering the recent weather
[07:17:19] he'll be lucky if we can reach Parson
[07:17:21] before dark damn maybe that's crying
[07:17:23] right it's been raining nonsense
[07:17:27] did she cooked them too hard he's crying
[07:17:30] now
[07:17:31] my man was just doing his job
[07:17:35] this is where my father's grave is
[07:17:38] to be perfectly honest
[07:17:41] even I haven't been back here for a long
[07:17:45] time
[07:17:46] huh there's someone there already
[07:17:49] wait
[07:17:50] the figure
[07:17:52] happy hmm
[07:17:55] isn't it oh he's here
[07:17:59] oh he cares
[07:18:01] such
[07:18:06] my apologies I should have asked before
[07:18:09] coming to pay my respects
[07:18:11] don't say that
[07:18:13] sorry about that
[07:18:15] oh
[07:18:16] I was trying to say there's no need for
[07:18:18] you to apologize
[07:18:20] I wanted to show my father how much I've
[07:18:22] grown
[07:18:23] but still I doubt I've grown to the
[07:18:26] point that even the Chief Justice would
[07:18:27] feel compelled to apologize to me over
[07:18:29] and over
[07:18:30] in that case I will stop apologizing for
[07:18:34] now for all the schedules
[07:18:36] yeah this guy does not understand how to
[07:18:38] talk it's okay I'll teach him hey not
[07:18:40] yet I know this might not be the case
[07:18:43] why did you come to Busan
[07:18:49] ever since that day I've been turning a
[07:18:51] question over and over in my head
[07:18:54] just what is justice anyway
[07:18:57] there was once a time when I didn't want
[07:18:59] to believe that there could be
[07:19:01] humans then life itself oh rather than
[07:19:05] that it's probably more truthful to say
[07:19:07] I didn't believe humans were capable of
[07:19:09] resisting the most Basic Instinct of
[07:19:11] living things
[07:19:13] that they could rebel against their own
[07:19:15] nature or consider certain things to be
[07:19:17] more important than their own lives
[07:19:19] which is also why I didn't stop your
[07:19:22] father from beginning that fateful Jewel
[07:19:23] I believe that a truly innocent man
[07:19:27] would never throw away his life like
[07:19:28] that
[07:19:29] there was nothing
[07:19:31] should have been nothing more important
[07:19:34] than one's own continued survival
[07:19:37] but Mr callous proved me utterly and
[07:19:40] decisively wrong if not for his
[07:19:43] sacrifice the serial disappearances case
[07:19:46] would have remained unsolved to this day
[07:19:48] Mr kallus made the choice he did for his
[07:19:51] daughter for his associates and for many
[07:19:54] people completely unrelated to him and
[07:19:57] in the end
[07:19:58] from a certain perspective
[07:20:00] looks like such a five star I don't know
[07:20:02] how to explain it he has too much dreary
[07:20:03] of Justice too many different color
[07:20:05] palettes
[07:20:09] so you asked me why like shades
[07:20:12] I just wanted to say my apologies to Mr
[07:20:14] callous in person
[07:20:16] I should have noticed all of this much
[07:20:18] sooner
[07:20:21] this regret has filled me with a sadness
[07:20:23] that has haunted me for days that high
[07:20:26] and mighty chair in the Opera epic
[07:20:28] players indeed insulates one from many
[07:20:30] important things
[07:20:32] foreign
[07:20:34] thank you so much for your hard work and
[07:20:37] perseverance
[07:20:38] well
[07:20:40] I'm sorry for being mad at you before
[07:20:43] so you're actually one of those types
[07:20:46] that's cold on the outside but pretty
[07:20:49] thoughtful on the inside huh
[07:20:51] that reminds me of silver another silver
[07:20:53] matches
[07:20:55] too easy for silver
[07:20:59] strong all right I guess I like silver
[07:21:01] now
[07:21:02] just say you don't need to apologize
[07:21:09] I've made their pieces
[07:21:11] Let's Not Disturb them for now we can
[07:21:13] wait till after they're done
[07:21:23] my month never paid respects at
[07:21:26] someone's grave before
[07:21:27] uh did Pinemont do anything rude there
[07:21:38] is still standing around there
[07:21:40] it's not often that we can catch him
[07:21:42] alone like this so why don't we go talk
[07:21:45] to him for a bit I forget oh we're going
[07:21:47] to talk to him cool
[07:21:50] how do we not pay respect to anyone's
[07:21:52] grave I feel like a lot of people died
[07:21:53] I'm like not that many like characters
[07:21:54] like no like playable characters die
[07:21:56] because Genji moment but like
[07:21:59] can we play respects the child he's

[07:22:46] used on [ __ ] it
[07:22:48] I don't know if it's the right set I
[07:22:50] don't know what he wants I don't know
[07:22:51] who anyone wants I don't know anything
[07:22:52] what do I know I don't know anything but
[07:22:54] we might as well roll a piece next to
[07:22:55] him might as well
[07:22:59] I don't know I mean if he's there we
[07:23:01] might as well test it if he's that we
[07:23:02] might as well test it if
[07:23:06] foreign
[07:23:08] things never change I guess
[07:23:10] all right it was worth a shot there was
[07:23:13] something
[07:23:14] what's up what's up dude oh it's YouTube
[07:23:17] oh cause Navi is here and she's Geo so
[07:23:20] defense no wonder it's Novia it's Navia
[07:23:22] it's not yet yeah
[07:23:24] [Music]
[07:23:26] I see
[07:23:28] then is there something that I can help
[07:23:30] you with
[07:23:35] questions please feel free
[07:23:37] though Outsiders you helped us solve one
[07:23:39] of the greatest mysteries in Fontaine
[07:23:41] and it would be my pleasure to return
[07:23:43] the favor
[07:23:53] I still believe the Judgment of the
[07:23:56] oratories was not rendered arbitrarily
[07:24:02] for many years I have been quite aware
[07:24:04] that the oratories does not simply
[07:24:06] mechanically repeat the verdict that I
[07:24:08] give on each as a divinely created
[07:24:10] mechanism the people's unified faith in
[07:24:12] the concept of justice is integrated
[07:24:14] into it not only can It produce the
[07:24:16] incredible power of indemnidium but it
[07:24:19] likely also possesses other traits such
[07:24:22] as self-awareness
[07:24:23] which is all to say I have been prepared
[07:24:25] for a situation like this for a long
[07:24:27] time
[07:24:30] [Music]
[07:24:31] I was not aware such a thing had
[07:24:33] occurred
[07:24:34] perhaps that could serve to prove my
[07:24:36] conjecture I will add that to the list
[07:24:38] of items to investigate
[07:24:40] in any case I am inclined to believe
[07:24:42] that the oratories does have a
[07:24:43] methodology all its own
[07:24:45] we just do not have enough information
[07:24:48] based on farina's reaction I doubt even
[07:24:50] she had any idea what was going on
[07:24:53] she managed to Bluff her way
[07:24:56] so true foreign
[07:25:05] Harbinger will just have to abide his
[07:25:07] time in the Fortress of marapid Farina
[07:25:10] okay farina's what happens if Fishel
[07:25:12] gets born as an archon and without oz to
[07:25:15] keep her in check it's kind of like
[07:25:16] official but like more unhinged because
[07:25:18] she actually is an archon and Oz isn't
[07:25:21] there to be like
[07:25:22] chill
[07:25:24] if we did incorrectly convict him of
[07:25:26] crimes he did not
[07:25:28] commitment to the fullest extent Allowed
[07:25:31] by the law
[07:25:38] is there anything else you would like to
[07:25:40] ask me about
[07:25:43] Yes actually there's only one of about
[07:25:45] my sit why the [ __ ] would you know
[07:25:46] because he's dressed like Danes Leaf I
[07:25:47] guess yeah I mean he does hey your
[07:25:50] sibling another blonde-haired Traveler
[07:25:54] I'm sorry that I've never she looks so
[07:25:56] [ __ ] good dude I actually can't
[07:25:58] if you ever stepped foot in Fontaine I'm
[07:26:01] sure he followed our laws to the letter
[07:26:02] and had no reason to appear on the stage
[07:26:05] of the ice there or anything else you'd
[07:26:07] like to ask me
[07:26:08] Yes actually uh about the prophecy
[07:26:10] because that the sea levels will rise
[07:26:12] and everyone will be dissolved in water
[07:26:14] leaving Farina crying alone on her yeah
[07:26:16] pretty much you got tons of the people
[07:26:18] will be finally washed away for good
[07:26:20] does that appropriately summarize the
[07:26:22] version you've heard
[07:26:31] yes up to the present I think we reached
[07:26:33] a point where we have no choice but to
[07:26:35] confront this prophecy directly rumors
[07:26:38] have it that this prophecy is rooted in
[07:26:40] the last words the former Hydro ARCA
[07:26:42] greater Lord no all I'm saying I'm sorry
[07:26:49] wow imagine living is like wait that
[07:26:52] reminds me of the former dental and then
[07:26:54] it just Nikita dies she just says the
[07:26:56] name Boop
[07:26:58] two parts of the prophecy have already
[07:27:00] proven correct the rising sea levels and
[07:27:03] the ability of the people of Fontaine to
[07:27:05] be dissolved we should be more Vigilant
[07:27:08] and stay on the watch for further signs
[07:27:11] speaking of the prophecy Farina has also
[07:27:13] always taken it quite seriously indeed
[07:27:16] she has been collecting information and
[07:27:18] intelligence from across to that for
[07:27:20] this purpose if the rumors were true
[07:27:22] then perhaps this prophecy is the
[07:27:25] conundrum left to Farina by her
[07:27:27] predecessor
[07:27:29] [Music]
[07:27:33] is there anything else you'd like to ask
[07:27:36] okay it just she didn't respond all
[07:27:38] right about the water from the
[07:27:40] primordial sea
[07:27:43] refer to that special water as
[07:27:50] truthfully that name is already quite
[07:27:52] accurate I can only surmise that vashay
[07:27:54] and his ilk only learned of its nature
[07:27:56] in existence after extensive research
[07:27:59] there used to be a special C on the
[07:28:01] surface of this planet the nature of its
[07:28:04] sea water was rather different from that
[07:28:06] of the most of devat's life forms were
[07:28:08] first born in that special sea you could
[07:28:11] say it nurtured much of the life on this
[07:28:13] planet okay
[07:28:16] what began
[07:28:20] but today the primordial sea no longer
[07:28:23] exists on the planet's surface
[07:28:25] discovered must have been some kind of
[07:28:27] special case or a Remnant from a truly
[07:28:30] ancient age
[07:28:36] [Music]
[07:28:38] but if that's the case then why would
[07:28:42] people uh at least people from Fontaine
[07:28:46] dissolve in that kind of water
[07:28:48] indeed why would the primordial sea
[07:28:51] which was known to engender and nurture
[07:28:53] life suddenly reverse itself and devour
[07:28:56] life instead
[07:29:15] I wanna
[07:29:16] I'm not gonna say
[07:29:19] um
[07:29:21] that also doesn't match my understanding
[07:29:23] of this world and its laws there must
[07:29:26] still be some unknown Secrets around the
[07:29:28] people of this land
[07:29:31] foreign
[07:29:45] huh
[07:29:49] such
[07:29:51] yeah I don't know why the water would
[07:29:52] only [ __ ] with Fontaine people that
[07:29:54] doesn't really make sense but
[07:29:57] at least the Tori told us the sky is
[07:29:58] fake so maybe the [ __ ] water's fake
[07:30:00] too very well it was my I don't drink
[07:30:03] the tap water brother I very much
[07:30:05] enjoyed conversing with you
[07:30:07] it will soon be time for me to leave
[07:30:09] this I mean to be fair I was from
[07:30:10] Fontana I probably wouldn't [ __ ] that
[07:30:12] I'm not risking it [ __ ] that [ __ ]
[07:30:15] [Music]
[07:30:17] I'm boiling my water crime and villainy
[07:30:19] do not have the day
[07:30:20] off and so Justice must work around the
[07:30:22] clock as well
[07:30:23] this is merely the nature of a Justice's
[07:30:26] work
[07:30:32] because he's happy
[07:30:39] damn dude seven and a half hours no we
[07:30:42] started 30 minutes seven hours only

[07:39:38] expirations
[07:39:41] stream I enjoyed it I didn't enjoy
[07:39:43] wearing this but that was fun
[07:39:45] try was a bit weird at times but for the
[07:39:47] most part it was fun
[07:39:49] that [ __ ] that Marcel guy kind of
[07:39:51] [ __ ] me up what a [ __ ] loser but
[07:39:53] it's a good uh it's pretty good overall
[07:39:56] I'm more excited about like other fun
[07:39:58] thing quests like I want to see our
[07:39:59] lakino and [ __ ] so I'm excited for the
[07:40:01] other acts
[07:40:03] um
[07:40:04] I think farina's [ __ ] funny though
[07:40:06] like I don't know I think she's [ __ ]
[07:40:09] hilarious uh noviette's very Cocker I
[07:40:12] like I like Navia I like folk uh what
[07:40:14] the [ __ ] her name is chlorine too we
[07:40:17] haven't met Risley
[07:40:20] so I enjoy the characters
[07:40:22] um the the detective [ __ ] was like
[07:40:24] Danganronpa Vibe which I like so that
[07:40:26] was fun
[07:40:27] uh some of the story Parts I'm like
[07:40:29] question mark that could have been a
[07:40:31] little bit better but I like the
[07:40:32] mechanics and like the detective stuff
[07:40:33] so hopefully for the other quests it's
[07:40:34] even better
[07:40:36] um
[07:40:39] I think the nahida article Quest is
[07:40:41] still my favorite but this is definitely
[07:40:42] solid I think it's pretty good
[07:40:46] where's dogs that we take I love Farina
[07:40:48] like okay she's definitely annoying and
[07:40:50] gaslighting so like I feel like
[07:40:51] obviously if she was a real person I'd
[07:40:53] be like dude you are incompetent but as
[07:40:55] a character I think she's [ __ ]
[07:40:56] hilarious so like I like I like her
[07:40:58] existence I think it's funny
[07:41:00] um
[07:41:02] so yeah
[07:41:04] I don't know
[07:41:09] like I feel bad for her almost but at
[07:41:11] the same time it's like girl just
[07:41:13] [ __ ] like bro admit you can admit
[07:41:15] you're wrong because not but yeah like I
[07:41:17] don't know I think she's funny so I
[07:41:18] don't care
[07:41:20] it's nice to have a loser as an archon
[07:41:22] true
[07:41:24] true
[07:41:34] she's so fail wife
[07:41:36] I guess that is one way to describe her
[07:41:41] [Laughter]
[07:41:57] anyway yeah so I like that I like
[07:41:59] Neville a lot too he's cool and it feels
[07:42:01] like he has a bit more depth like he's
[07:42:02] not just like very shallow I feel like
[07:42:04] you actually like I don't know and he's
[07:42:06] probably a [ __ ] dragon and he like
[07:42:07] kind of like cares it's pretty cool so I
[07:42:09] like him I also like how he looks
[07:42:12] um so I'm very excited for him
[07:42:15] uh
[07:42:17] uh let's just say with a battle pass
[07:42:19] weapon I want may change for no reason
[07:42:21] we'll just wait to see what weapon he
[07:42:22] uses I don't know yet we'll just see and
[07:42:24] then we might decide all good it is what
[07:42:26] it is uh yeah we don't know man
[07:42:30] I thought staff though he's like oh
[07:42:34] who else uses the stuff I mean it looked
[07:42:36] like a walking cane the only person I
[07:42:37] could see using that is baiju so
[07:42:39] maybe that's a hint I don't know
[07:42:41] if I draw the snake
[07:42:44] welt true but wealth uses a light cone
[07:42:47] he doesn't use a weapon
[07:42:54] bro admit it susk dude we don't know
[07:43:00] we don't know
