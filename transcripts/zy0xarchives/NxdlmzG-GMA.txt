[00:09:48] people make dumb out of touch decision
[00:09:50] what's your take
[00:09:53] I don't know I mean they reverted it
[00:09:55] they're like oh we're sorry so it is
[00:09:57] what it is uh they reverted it it's fine
[00:09:59] but like yeah
[00:10:02] I mean the thing is okay here's the
[00:10:03] thing here's here's the thing with
[00:10:04] twitch there's like a lot of dumb [ __ ]
[00:10:06] that we Overlook because it's our
[00:10:08] platform okay so when they do stuff
[00:10:10] that's dumb
[00:10:11] it's like why are we tottering all the
[00:10:14] other [ __ ] like why am I tolerating
[00:10:17] it's fine it is what it is Johnny Alex
[00:10:20] is in two months
[00:10:21] can you do an account review I will pay
[00:10:23] attention or Star rail
[00:10:25] get it I I probably
[00:10:28] I'm not moving to chill I'm not moving
[00:10:32] this is my home you guys are my home
[00:10:39] what's up cass how you been
[00:10:47] I mean I have no loyalty to anything
[00:10:49] except you guys so I don't give a [ __ ]
[00:10:50] where ice cream I can stream on [ __ ]
[00:10:52] pornhub.live I don't give a [ __ ] I don't
[00:10:54] care I'll stream somewhere hopefully
[00:10:55] still twitch but if they decide like hey
[00:10:57] [ __ ] you then we'll go somewhere else
[00:10:58] but for now it looks like we're chilling
[00:11:00] because they reverted their thing so I'm
[00:11:02] not like quick to jump ship I think
[00:11:03] people are being a bit dramatic but it's
[00:11:05] definitely stupid so we'll see what
[00:11:06] happens
[00:11:12] um sorry I'm just checking everything
[00:11:13] right now actually no I don't need to
[00:11:14] check anything
[00:11:17] oh yeah apparently
[00:11:20] apparently
[00:11:25] can I change the Discord icon for pride
[00:11:27] month sure but then I look like a
[00:11:29] corporation that's doing it just to like
[00:11:31] be hip so I don't know I mean it's up to
[00:11:33] you guys I don't give a [ __ ] I'm I'm
[00:11:34] cool with it either way but I feel like
[00:11:36] every time I like I don't know I don't
[00:11:40] want to look like a [ __ ] Corporation
[00:11:45] so it's up to you guys
[00:11:58] anyways welcome to this oh what if we
[00:12:00] change it though
[00:12:02] what if I change our server icon to
[00:12:03] homies
[00:12:05] this wait where is it this
[00:12:09] okay I never looked at the emote
[00:12:11] close-up but
[00:12:14] I better take
[00:12:16] anyways welcome to the stream I hope
[00:12:19] you're all doing well I'm not
[00:12:21] I recorded okay listen listen I don't
[00:12:24] know if stereo guides are worth it
[00:12:26] because like I'm better at genjin
[00:12:28] gungeon's easier less effort more views
[00:12:31] more people play it and it's like
[00:12:34] I am confident in my game knowledge
[00:12:37] whereas with starrell there's always
[00:12:39] like weird [ __ ] that I like
[00:12:41] like okay like I look into everything
[00:12:43] for sale but it's like what if or I
[00:12:45] haven't but what if like it's not like
[00:12:46] oh you didn't think about Servals E4
[00:12:48] under the like this this and I was like
[00:12:50] oh I don't know what the [ __ ] that does
[00:12:52] but it sounds like oh he forgot diona C4
[00:12:54] it's like okay like I like that's
[00:12:56] something that I should have known but
[00:12:58] anyways
[00:12:59] uh the thing with stereo is like
[00:13:01] uh the thing with okay right now I
[00:13:03] recorded uh okay I recorded everything
[00:13:05] for silver wolf everything
[00:13:08] but then this patch they decided to
[00:13:11] change the effect hit rate today uh the
[00:13:13] effect resistance of enemies I don't
[00:13:15] know if you guys saw the passengers I
[00:13:16] don't know where they are someone could
[00:13:17] link them I could probably look it up
[00:13:18] but they changed the effect the effect
[00:13:21] resistance of all enemies which means
[00:13:22] they buffed silver wolf by making her
[00:13:25] need about 40 percent
[00:13:28] yeah 40 less affected rate which is
[00:13:31] [ __ ] huge instead of needing 136 she
[00:13:33] now needs 96.
[00:13:37] so it's like a lot he's like basically
[00:13:40] so you guys understand before the patch
[00:13:43] she needed so much affected rate that
[00:13:44] her five-star light cone was garbage
[00:13:46] unless you have her E2 like it was
[00:13:48] literally bait if you didn't however E2
[00:13:50] the 5 star light cone was bait and now
[00:13:52] they changed it to where it's still kind
[00:13:55] of baby but if you have but without E2
[00:13:57] but it's like a lot better
[00:14:00] um yeah
[00:14:06] basically like I I had it all
[00:14:09] pre-recorded and now I have to like redo
[00:14:11] everything so I'm kind of tilted and
[00:14:13] it's like this is gonna take so long but
[00:14:15] it's fine because it's a silver wolf
[00:14:16] puff which is good it means she's better
[00:14:18] and now listen uh coin out thanks to
[00:14:22] prime a key order I [ __ ] your name Aki
[00:14:25] these are nine months Canada they said
[00:14:27] three oddly things in 30 months
[00:14:30] uh with that in mind the one thing I
[00:14:32] think is weirdos is I think okay now
[00:14:35] tell me if I'm coping tell me if I'm
[00:14:36] wrong to anyone who's like looked into
[00:14:37] silver alphabet I feel like people are
[00:14:41] over fixating
[00:14:45] it's out okay but if you're like if
[00:14:47] you're okay I'm gonna ban you if it's
[00:14:48] not out so I'm gonna ban you now and
[00:14:50] then if it's out I'll unban you is the
[00:14:51] server back up just one day yeah I'll
[00:14:53] check if it's not you're you're getting
[00:14:55] if it's not you're not getting unbanned
[00:14:59] oh ripples okay I guess it's not
[00:15:01] okay it's not okay
[00:15:03] anyways listen already so anyone who's
[00:15:06] uh uh seeing silver rolls kid and stuff
[00:15:09] I think people are over hyping the part
[00:15:11] of her kit that puts a weakness onto
[00:15:13] enemies because it's nice but I feel
[00:15:16] like if you're building a team around
[00:15:17] that specifically what the [ __ ] is your
[00:15:19] team what you only have a lightning
[00:15:21] character on your whole account and you
[00:15:22] can't swap if the enemy's weak to ice
[00:15:24] and you just have to build [ __ ]
[00:15:26] lightning no matter what like what are
[00:15:27] you doing so it's like I get it it's
[00:15:30] nice rest red it's nice
[00:15:32] yeah it could be RNG it depends on the
[00:15:34] enemy like you can kind of manipulate it
[00:15:36] okay here's the thing I think the RNG
[00:15:38] part if you're being smart in memory of
[00:15:40] chaos what do I tell people to do with
[00:15:42] Eula reset if you don't quit what the
[00:15:44] [ __ ] can you do with silver Eula you
[00:15:46] reset if you don't get the [ __ ]
[00:15:48] um weakness you want so you press e if
[00:15:51] you don't get [ __ ] Quantum alt f4 or
[00:15:53] you don't get [ __ ] pyro alt f4 run it
[00:15:55] back it's fine you can get more value
[00:15:56] out of her kit than it looks like but
[00:15:59] uh I do want to say I think that isn't
[00:16:02] even the main part of our kid I think
[00:16:03] people are like oh my God it's random
[00:16:04] it's copium you don't need that sure but
[00:16:07] I think the main reason you play her
[00:16:09] is because she debuffs everything else
[00:16:10] she develops defense she develops speed
[00:16:12] she debuffs resistances not a huge
[00:16:15] amount but still
[00:16:17] um
[00:16:18] and I think there's another one maybe
[00:16:19] another defense yeah there's two defense
[00:16:22] uh attack but who the [ __ ] cares about
[00:16:24] enemies attack oh yes the enemy deals
[00:16:26] less damage to me yes
[00:16:28] sorry but yeah like overall it's like
[00:16:30] it's that and single third damage now
[00:16:32] the only like the only like trap card
[00:16:34] like oh I got you is why don't you just
[00:16:37] play pillow
[00:16:39] hey you got me look up true like
[00:16:42] pillow's pretty broken I think peel is
[00:16:43] broken pill is more AOE less single
[00:16:46] Target uh lower investment but at high
[00:16:48] investment silver wolf will be better
[00:16:49] that's like what I think
[00:16:52] um I think peel is really good so that's
[00:16:54] what we're gonna talk about today but I
[00:16:56] do think that silver wolf no she's not a
[00:16:58] muscle bro I just said peel you could
[00:17:00] just use pillow how did this get to a
[00:17:01] muscle just [ __ ] play pillow but like
[00:17:04] she's definitely good
[00:17:06] I just don't think like yeah she's good
[00:17:08] but replaceable I think
[00:17:11] also she just got better because they
[00:17:13] removed how much effect they reduced how
[00:17:15] much effect hit rate you need
[00:17:19] squeal this is how nuts
[00:17:22] Raquel is in six months
[00:17:25] she could be a muscle depending on how
[00:17:26] her kid Works no we know how her kid
[00:17:27] works why the [ __ ] would she be a muscle
[00:17:29] she's really good def Shred
[00:17:33] but not a muscle you just play pillow
[00:17:35] and then if your pillows in one okay
[00:17:37] like the odds of you having okay the
[00:17:39] odds of you being like I need people on
[00:17:41] one team and silver with another it's
[00:17:43] like very like
[00:17:46] that means you probably don't have room
[00:17:48] for either well tingyun brania Asta I
[00:17:51] guess asta's worse uh um any Shield
[00:17:54] character any offensive like erudition
[00:17:57] like double DPS thing like you're
[00:17:58] literally running like the same team
[00:18:00] twice so I don't know maybe like maybe
[00:18:04] we don't know how the odds work okay
[00:18:05] here's how the odds are gonna work if
[00:18:07] I'm wrong
[00:18:08] I'm wrong but here's how I assume the
[00:18:10] author how we know I think we know
[00:18:11] because there's a trial or some [ __ ] but
[00:18:13] I think how the odds were because it's
[00:18:14] just it rolls every element uh um the
[00:18:18] same
[00:18:19] percentage so let's say you're like
[00:18:20] let's say you have three Lightnings one
[00:18:22] Quantum it's 50 50. let's say you have
[00:18:24] one lightning like one lightning one
[00:18:26] fire one wind one [ __ ] watt there's
[00:18:29] no water but let's say there's a water
[00:18:30] it's 25 25 25. I'm pretty sure it's just
[00:18:33] even
[00:18:34] but we'll see when she's out
[00:18:37] I might be wrong
[00:18:44] well okay it's not known but it's like
[00:18:47] it was tested back when she was playable
[00:18:49] so maybe they changed it that's the only
[00:18:51] thing like they might have changed it
[00:18:52] because they changed affected rate
[00:18:58] do you think four quantum will be okay
[00:19:00] when we get more units I mean I don't
[00:19:03] know what the [ __ ] are the new units are
[00:19:05] we getting [ __ ] Quantum Buddha
[00:19:07] Quantum Jin Yuan
[00:19:15] um
[00:19:24] Quantum Bennett
[00:19:28] does she take account whether we do yes
[00:19:29] yes yes she does yes she does yes she
[00:19:31] does she you can manipulate it's not as
[00:19:33] random as you think because it takes
[00:19:35] into account the weaknesses she already
[00:19:36] has so you can build your team
[00:19:38] accordingly and go for weaknesses
[00:19:39] accordingly
[00:19:41] you could also reset you can also just
[00:19:42] go memory of chaos player first off oh
[00:19:45] no I didn't get altafor go again or
[00:19:47] press your skill twice it's not that
[00:19:48] hard
[00:19:49] yeah it's less skill point efficient but
[00:19:51] it is what it is so like I think it's
[00:19:52] more manipulatable than people are
[00:19:54] making out to be but I also think it's
[00:19:57] less relevant than people make it out to
[00:19:58] be like it's still good obviously you
[00:19:59] want the weaknesses that you want but
[00:20:01] like it's also just like
[00:20:03] she's good even without that part of her
[00:20:05] kid so it's fine
[00:20:08] what do you consider a muscle in HSR
[00:20:12] it's [ __ ] patch 1.1 bro not even well
[00:20:16] it's not even out
[00:20:18] not even out
[00:20:19] also I've heard luoch is really good
[00:20:23] but
[00:20:25] it's not even out bro chill like we
[00:20:28] don't know enough yet
[00:20:29] like if you ask me that in genshin 1.1 I
[00:20:32] guess who would have said venti I guess
[00:20:34] at the time but now venti's not even
[00:20:35] that good anymore
[00:20:38] donated one dollar what are your
[00:20:41] thoughts on Quantum xiangling Mr
[00:20:43] stripper
[00:20:44] Quantum shangling oppa
[00:20:46] damn
[00:20:52] well
[00:20:56] who says Shell's not good anymore [ __ ]
[00:20:58] you dude literally play far is on
[00:21:01] Bennett boom best team in the game all
[00:21:02] right you know 30 second timeout to
[00:21:04] think about your actions literally not
[00:21:06] true literally not true no code feel not
[00:21:09] true not true
[00:21:13] any videos doesn't solved I will fold
[00:21:15] that hung guide I just never released it
[00:21:16] so I should release it it's literally
[00:21:18] fully edited there's a thumbnail for it
[00:21:21] I literally have a thumbnail for it
[00:21:22] where is it
[00:21:27] um oh my God imagine people calling
[00:21:31] units must pull in up the game BTW lamal
[00:21:35] yeah
[00:21:37] wait where is it dude it's so far this
[00:21:39] is before genuine
[00:21:41] yeah see
[00:21:44] I have a [ __ ] thumbnail for it I
[00:21:46] already done but whatever it'll be on at
[00:21:49] some point so I think silver wolf than
[00:21:51] that and then a few Gantry videos I've
[00:21:52] planned and then we'll see from there
[00:22:03] also okay listen kind of embarrassing
[00:22:06] I've been actually pre-forming silver
[00:22:08] for a while but I realized two things
[00:22:10] one I have a level 80 light cone and I'm
[00:22:12] probably just gonna get the event one so
[00:22:13] I might have [ __ ] up all of my icon
[00:22:15] mats two
[00:22:17] uh I okay so okay listen I don't have a
[00:22:23] good
[00:22:24] two piece of simulated Universe World 5
[00:22:27] which is the hit rate one which is the
[00:22:29] most afforded two piece for her
[00:22:30] so we're probably gonna use like
[00:22:32] inertile Soto it is what it is but we're
[00:22:35] gonna have to farm somebody Universe
[00:22:37] five
[00:22:38] but everything else is yeah also also
[00:22:40] that's true with Kelsey uh
[00:22:43] because they changed how much hit rate
[00:22:45] you need we probably don't need as much
[00:22:47] well we we need 40 less now which means
[00:22:50] you don't technically need
[00:22:53] not set anymore
[00:22:55] but you probably still go it right
[00:22:57] because it's
[00:22:58] um it's 25 attack
[00:23:00] if you have a hundred percent which
[00:23:01] you're going 96 so let's say 100 that's
[00:23:03] 25 attack and 10 hitter rate so I don't
[00:23:06] see why you wouldn't go it
[00:23:09] yeah it's still investors
[00:23:13] it's just donated two dollars yeah
[00:23:15] exactly you can go crit body now every
[00:23:17] time a man comes on screen I can't take
[00:23:20] it a man comes
[00:23:29] but yeah so I think I think what that
[00:23:31] means okay sorry to be nerds right now
[00:23:32] but I think what that means is um
[00:23:35] what was I gonna say yeah okay so look
[00:23:38] okay hear me out you just need a 136 now
[00:23:40] you need 96 right
[00:23:43] 18 from her traces unless they change it
[00:23:45] 40 from the free to play light cone 40
[00:23:48] from 36 from the body I think of bodies
[00:23:51] 36 I forgot the number but I think it's
[00:23:53] 36 and then you get
[00:23:56] um
[00:23:58] 10 from the OH 43 yeah 43 43 and then uh
[00:24:03] 10 from the two piece so that's 40 plus
[00:24:06] 40 plus 10 plus 18. that's 108
[00:24:11] wait what yeah it should be 108 plus
[00:24:13] three so 111.
[00:24:17] five percent on planet we know you're
[00:24:18] trolling
[00:24:24] anyways so that's like too much which
[00:24:27] means you could either go for a
[00:24:30] you can either go for a crit body but
[00:24:32] then you need a lot of sub stats or you
[00:24:34] could go for the the naked back like on
[00:24:36] the guy was like Luca Luca Luca Tim
[00:24:39] Lucas Timothy you can go for Luca uh uh
[00:24:42] Luca's back icon or you could go for
[00:24:44] still like the the event like it was
[00:24:47] still really good because it gives you
[00:24:47] energy to it energy is important but
[00:24:51] uh you're gonna go different like on or
[00:24:53] you can go crit crit body used to be
[00:24:55] griefing well not grieving but like not
[00:24:57] recommended but now it might be like
[00:24:59] viable
[00:25:00] or you just have a bit extra hit rate
[00:25:02] who cares honestly uh it's fine
[00:25:06] um
[00:25:07] or you could go a different two-piece
[00:25:09] your last two Beast instead of being Pan
[00:25:11] Galactic commercial Commerce could be
[00:25:14] something else
[00:25:24] why is more than 100 too much it's not
[00:25:26] but they changed it
[00:25:28] okay I'm gonna be honest I just know the
[00:25:30] formula for affected rate I don't know
[00:25:32] anything else because I'm not like like
[00:25:33] listen I'm still learning the [ __ ]
[00:25:36] like TC aspects of this game I just know
[00:25:37] the formula okay and all I know is that
[00:25:40] the effect hit the effect resistance of
[00:25:42] high level enemies
[00:25:44] changed and is changing this patch and
[00:25:48] it's making silver wolf go from needing
[00:25:50] one three six to Ninety Six that's what
[00:25:52] I know
[00:26:14] let me just make sure the game's not out
[00:26:15] if the game's not out we're doing Wordle
[00:26:18] as well cycle good for civil yes it used
[00:26:20] to be it's no no it's actually good it's
[00:26:21] actually good yeah it is Halo hello hi
[00:26:26] the light downside is I can probably buy
[00:26:28] it with like the star glitter soon but I
[00:26:30] decided to level 80 my existing light
[00:26:33] cone because like uh
[00:26:35] isn't that good yes it is okay the only
[00:26:38] reason I'm salty about the hit okay
[00:26:40] literatures are absolutely good it's a
[00:26:42] buff to Silver Wolf you can play it a
[00:26:44] bit more like a sub DPS because you need
[00:26:45] less hit rate which means you can go
[00:26:47] more speed more attack more crit more
[00:26:49] whatever
[00:26:50] the only thing is I had already recorded
[00:26:52] all the [ __ ] with the 136 number in mind
[00:26:54] and I'll have to redo everything it's
[00:26:56] not a bad thing it's just I have to redo
[00:26:58] everything it is what it is it is what
[00:26:59] it is

[00:38:25] horrible things my account is trash
[00:38:27] Samantha

[00:38:33] and someone said to wash my mouth stop
[00:38:36] talking okay wait wait chop chop chop
[00:38:38] chop chat chat chat chat Cha Cha Cha Cha
[00:38:41] Cha Cha I need some help as a function
[00:38:43] link I see that I'm becoming strong food
[00:38:46] I'm gonna kind of Chef that princess
[00:38:47] cure everything dies on my knees in the
[00:38:50] night saying praise to the stove God
[00:38:52] been additional my life
[00:38:58] what do we do a rang though
[00:39:02] [Music]
[00:39:04] okay wait so wait so wait so
[00:39:08] let me pull up my Discord because I
[00:39:09] wrote down how much
[00:39:14] [Music]
[00:39:18] I can live a normal life I was raised by
[00:39:21] a chain so I gotta use National so if we
[00:39:24] get okay hear me too much Theory
[00:39:25] crafting where is 413
[00:39:30] videos
[00:39:41] I'm not doing math games.com
[00:39:49] okay so if we need 96 hit rate on silver
[00:39:52] wolf right and we get 40 uh 40 from her
[00:39:55] like on and then 18 from traces assuming
[00:39:58] they didn't change it and then 10 from
[00:40:00] the set and then
[00:40:03] 40 would be 43 from the body right
[00:40:07] well let's say we don't go the body how
[00:40:09] much is a substance what's an average
[00:40:10] subset role HR subscribe
[00:40:16] beneficial for the catcher shangling
[00:40:20] Paradise been fishing all my life for
[00:40:25] the catch a shangling paradise 3.4 to
[00:40:28] 4.4
[00:40:31] I'm 3.8 chamber after chamber
[00:40:33] everybody's running
[00:40:36] plus like
[00:40:37] you I mean that's not that that's not
[00:40:40] even alive
[00:40:41] because they have six pieces that's
[00:40:43] actually not a lot who's
[00:40:48] like 28 divided by three point let's say
[00:40:51] seven
[00:40:52] like seven eight
[00:40:55] that's like not bad
[00:40:58] eight rolls
[00:41:02] every time but it's probably better it's
[00:41:05] I think it's copium though
[00:41:09] it's okay but I feel like while at this
[00:41:12] point you might want to just go a body
[00:41:13] and then maybe you change your weapon
[00:41:18] yeah it is six pieces like that's like
[00:41:22] one point whatever the [ __ ]
[00:41:24] per piece right
[00:41:27] but you can also go you can also go hit
[00:41:29] rate body and then
[00:41:31] a weapon that's more offensive or
[00:41:34] you go iterate body and then [ __ ] your
[00:41:36] two-piece snub but the two piece that
[00:41:38] gives you attack and hit rate is very
[00:41:39] valuable
[00:41:42] sorry yeah okay
[00:41:46] I guess this means body's useful now
[00:41:48] though
[00:41:53] let me write this down on my notepad
[00:41:56] equal if CR body
[00:41:59] on eight rolls
[00:42:06] okay I think what this means
[00:42:08] is normal players normal to low
[00:42:12] investment
[00:42:14] go hit rate body
[00:42:19] it's up cool
[00:42:22] but if you're high investment
[00:42:26] dude
[00:42:28] it's not up
[00:42:30] this one man
[00:42:32] one hour timeout
[00:42:43] but if you're high investment you can go
[00:42:45] crit or attack but probably crit body
[00:42:49] okay
[00:42:51] um
[00:42:52] yeah the two piece isn't needed anymore
[00:42:54] I agree but it is a lot of stats isn't
[00:42:56] it
[00:42:58] because it's it's 10 hit rate is like
[00:43:00] three rolls
[00:43:02] 10 hitter is is like three rolls and
[00:43:04] then you're getting 25 attack which is a
[00:43:07] lot of rolls
[00:43:09] so it feels like it's still a good
[00:43:10] option it's just not needed
[00:43:20] where did FaceCam go hi
[00:43:27] Relic sets HSR
[00:43:31] tell me why shangling is so op I can
[00:43:39] vaporize balls balls
[00:43:44] like
[00:43:48] testimony donated one dollar they're
[00:43:51] saying it'll be up at 11 now stop
[00:43:53] getting one guide by chat
[00:43:55] ah okay
[00:43:57] sorry
[00:44:05] this doesn't even look bad but ah yeah
[00:44:08] like this one okay space stealing
[00:44:10] station is 24 attack right that's like a
[00:44:13] pretty like viable like support set like
[00:44:15] it's pretty good well not support but
[00:44:16] like for yeah it's like pretty decent
[00:44:18] and like this one is just objectively
[00:44:20] better because even if you only have 100
[00:44:22] hit rate which is about how much you're
[00:44:24] going for you're getting 25. so it's
[00:44:27] just better and then you also get like
[00:44:29] three subside rolls of hit rate so it's
[00:44:31] literally always better
[00:44:35] so the only other option would be Fleet
[00:44:37] of Aegis or inner South Soto and that's
[00:44:39] like do you really care about I mean you
[00:44:40] know the old damage is nice but
[00:44:45] yeah
[00:44:48] gold Mars six or three months
[00:44:51] yeah fleet Fleet is the also the other
[00:44:53] pretty good option space stealing

[00:51:13] instead of being flashy this guy was
[00:51:14] like he wanted to show this to his

[00:52:01] a chess game okay fine let's do chess
[00:52:04] okay okay all right start a standards
[00:52:07] okay
[00:52:09] okay give up
[00:52:12] this is a strategy I don't know about
[00:52:14] the pawns Gambit
[00:52:24] wait wait
[00:52:26] wait wait wait
[00:52:28] wait wait okay what is happening
[00:52:32] sometimes when people give up a pawn I'm
[00:52:34] like is this like a grand master or
[00:52:35] something I don't know about that's why
[00:52:37] but
[00:52:39] okay this has to be like dude this has
[00:52:41] to be white Potter okay
[00:52:44] okay maybe we'd all do chess maybe you
[00:52:47] know what OverWatch fine let's try our
[00:52:48] watch
[00:52:50] his name is wrath not least diamond
[00:52:57] wait
[00:52:59] [Music]
[00:53:02] he just walked up to them how did it how
[00:53:06] does this work
[00:53:09] okay I mean I don't this could be
[00:53:10] anything like oh
[00:53:12] it ain't been
[00:53:20] oh where does this guy come from
[00:53:22] okay what is this bro what okay who did
[00:53:28] he pin
[00:53:32] okay that's like plot I think
[00:53:34] a spot
[00:53:36] okay all right whatever it's Reinhardt
[00:53:38] it literally could have been xqc right
[00:53:40] [ __ ] dude it's the Reinhardt okay
[00:53:42] they just guess like it could be
[00:53:43] anything unless he like blocks of
[00:53:44] shattered if you like blocks of Shadow
[00:53:46] like Shadow is good but this guy's gonna
[00:53:48] try to block it so we'll see wait what
[00:53:50] the [ __ ] happened how do you get stunned
[00:53:53] oh he got slapped
[00:53:56] wait that Honor's insane wait what the
[00:53:57] [ __ ] wait
[00:54:01] oh okay the honor carried that so the
[00:54:04] honest if your honor is that good it's
[00:54:06] probably higher rank right truly
[00:54:11] look they were all here so that Ryan
[00:54:13] wants to block shatter so he drops
[00:54:14] Shield to bait it wait Did he fire
[00:54:16] strike
[00:54:18] oh a fire truck okay he's terrible never
[00:54:20] mind who the [ __ ] fire trucks there
[00:54:26] but the on is pretty good
[00:54:29] that could be anything maybe it's not a
[00:54:30] fire strike it just looked like it
[00:54:36] I don't know what do you think Chad
[00:54:41] like why are they grouped in a cubby
[00:54:43] like why would your team play there
[00:54:45] what type of Reinhardt shot calling yo
[00:54:47] guys let's push [ __ ]
[00:54:49] push Health back
[00:54:53] yeah
[00:54:55] yeah I think it's that good
[00:54:56] but I think the haunt is good but I
[00:54:58] don't know what that means because
[00:54:59] they're also
[00:55:01] even their team was all nated
[00:55:06] gold I'm gonna guess plot again I don't
[00:55:08] think it's gold
[00:55:12] I mean maybe it's gold dude what
[00:55:13] differentiates like dude this could be
[00:55:15] anything the enemies suck balls but like
[00:55:18] it's open q wait really

[00:57:01] I feel like if there's
[00:57:06] I feel like if there's no like blunders
[00:57:07] within the first 20 moves
[00:57:09] then they're at least high rank wait was
[00:57:11] that oh yeah that was Steven
[00:57:21] I don't know how to judge this I mean
[00:57:26] every trade has been even truly that
[00:57:27] means they don't suck balls right

[00:58:12] think it was that high
[00:58:14] I guess I should have known no mistakes
[00:58:16] equal high rank
[00:58:20] dumb

[00:58:52] each ranks means
[00:58:54] like I yeah
[00:58:56] just you're trying to dodge a flash that
[00:58:58] has to be good
[00:59:03] but I full screen this

[01:13:05] look at that later
[01:13:10] looks like on his greatest always three
[01:13:11] resources yeah I know I know I know it's
[01:13:13] good on a lot of characters it's also
[01:13:15] fine on several it's just usually
[01:13:16] there's better options
[01:13:18] also okay if I don't have enough XP I'll
[01:13:20] just [ __ ] do fuel it's fine shut up

[01:13:57] so like after playing Gadget not getting
[01:13:59] like a bonus here feels like such a
[01:14:01] waste like not like having a character
[01:14:03] like you see like extra ones it like
[01:14:04] hurts
[01:14:10] I promise yo I prefung but I have to

[01:14:53] City pre-farmed okay I did but then I
[01:14:55] realized if I'm gonna use silver wolf
[01:14:57] she's a support so I need my other
[01:14:59] characters to be geared so I used a lot
[01:15:00] of the masks that I pre-farmed on my
[01:15:02] other characters so that they wouldn't
[01:15:04] suck balls does that make sense that

[01:20:03] harmonic tune for silver wolf it's not
[01:20:05] for her but it's for a team true
[01:20:07] and then we also get uh five five pulls
[01:20:10] true and then we also get
[01:20:14] more credits to 10.
[01:20:20] and then we do a little a little bit
[01:20:22] actually we don't have to finish
[01:20:23] leveling here okay
[01:20:26] um
[01:20:28] this will be okay Tracy for that we'll
[01:20:29] get them higher for sure don't worry but
[01:20:31] first let me do the other [ __ ] uh which
[01:20:33] is relics now okay I want to go the two
[01:20:36] piece of the hit rate set but that's the
[01:20:38] only thing I didn't Farm I have no hit
[01:20:40] rate 2vs because world five sucks donkey
[01:20:42] balls so we'll do that together but for
[01:20:44] now we'll use Fleet of the Ageless which
[01:20:45] is like a fine it's a fine set because
[01:20:47] they just you know uh but we want
[01:20:49] um energy Regen
[01:20:52] which I know I have I just have to find
[01:20:54] it uh
[01:20:56] uh might be a
[01:20:58] oh we could do space stealing actually
[01:21:03] or inert
[01:21:05] we could do a nerd for now
[01:21:07] these substance are kind of uh actually
[01:21:09] we have hit rate on it yeah it's fine
[01:21:10] for now
[01:21:11] I'll get out we'll get a five someone
[01:21:12] later
[01:21:21] okay hit rate okay no hit rate all right
[01:21:24] that's terrible all good
[01:21:27] check the new whale Trace boxes from
[01:21:29] shop wait why would I look at whale
[01:21:31] boxes why would I look at whale boxes I
[01:21:34] would never buy a whale box
[01:21:37] wait which ones are new
[01:21:38] this
[01:21:44] oh [ __ ]
[01:21:46] dude I have zero gems I would never buy
[01:21:48] these I'm not a [ __ ] whale why dude
[01:21:50] why would I buy these I'm not a whale
[01:21:51] why the [ __ ] would I buy these
[01:22:00] okay Chad this is something I'm not
[01:22:01] gonna lie this is nothing Chad listen
[01:22:03] listen I have to play like three games
[01:22:06] okay it's hard to
[01:22:12] silver wolf
[01:22:14] okay we have uh we're gonna go for the
[01:22:16] new set on her as I said well the the
[01:22:17] hit rate set but until then we're gonna
[01:22:19] go enter South Soto because I don't have
[01:22:20] a Quantum ball of any other set I know
[01:22:23] it's the worst Quantum ball you've seen
[01:22:24] I mean hit rate you know it is what it
[01:22:26] is it's not a great Quantum ball though
[01:22:27] uh uh also wait this means I don't have
[01:22:30] one for Celie
[01:22:32] I'll just play yanching I think our
[01:22:34] yanching is pretty good
[01:22:41] we could also just go [ __ ] sub stats
[01:22:43] for now
[01:22:44] yeah I lied we're just gonna go
[01:22:45] substance for now
[01:22:50] and then we'll just feed this in later
[01:22:53] only two games as far as I'm concerned
[01:22:55] okay but have you considered that my
[01:22:56] gentian account I also have an Asia
[01:22:58] account true have you considered that
[01:23:00] because I don't think you have
[01:23:01] also have you considered the fact that I
[01:23:03] have a lot I touch grass I go outside
[01:23:05] that's a that's a game Life the Game of
[01:23:09] Life
[01:23:18] all right we're gonna go uh musketeer I
[01:23:21] think or or quantum
[01:23:23] this has hit rate on it we could level
[01:23:25] that I've saved all the pieces that I
[01:23:27] want to use for her I just waited for
[01:23:28] stream to level them uh because I
[01:23:30] thought it'd be more fun where are they
[01:23:33] this one that has hit rate but we need
[01:23:35] less hit rate than I thought because
[01:23:37] they they kind of nerfed it or buffed it
[01:23:38] I mean
[01:23:46] well yeah we'll go for uh for quantum
[01:23:53] yeah we'll go for a quantum
[01:23:56] I'll try look at these boots I got
[01:24:00] look at these boots I got
[01:24:01] look at these boots I got
[01:24:10] yeah so pretty good
[01:24:14] mid no absolutely not mid this is
[01:24:16] absolutely not mid there is no world
[01:24:19] this is meant every substat is perfect
[01:24:21] it's just the roles aren't like the best
[01:24:23] but they're still good it's literally
[01:24:25] not mid
[01:24:27] I don't think it's not my genuine it has
[01:24:29] no feet
[01:24:31] so let's give them uh [ __ ]
[01:24:35] let's give him someone's feet
[01:24:39] well I don't have any [ __ ] good speed
[01:24:40] boost now
[01:24:42] I can just get my attack
[01:24:45] the thing I don't like about this game
[01:24:46] is how I don't have enough [ __ ]
[01:24:48] relics for every character I play
[01:24:50] not the game's fault more my fault but
[01:24:52] it is what it is okay we're gonna plus
[01:24:53] uh 50 in this
[01:24:55] you have enough yeah we should have
[01:24:56] enough
[01:24:57] yeah should be fine
[01:25:01] you can also throw this in
[01:25:03] yeah this missed a lot I know this
[01:25:10] wow that was [ __ ] terrible okay maybe
[01:25:13] I mean uh main side of the main stat I
[01:25:17] guess
[01:25:18] but that was [ __ ] atrocious all right
[01:25:21] glove time
[01:25:22] now gloves uh we might have to go or
[01:25:25] sorry flower
[01:25:27] oh sorry I had we have a good history
[01:25:29] one
[01:25:31] our boots are really good our bodies
[01:25:32] like you know iterate but our gloves
[01:25:34] kind of suck we don't have a hit rate
[01:25:35] one I don't think right
[01:25:38] I thought I did have one yeah we have
[01:25:40] this one but it's [ __ ] HP defense so
[01:25:42] there's no way we're using that so I
[01:25:43] think gloves would just say [ __ ] it and
[01:25:45] we go like crit
[01:25:47] or I could you like my sealies
[01:25:50] Zila hey everyone today we're going to
[01:25:52] talk about Zelo
[01:25:55] [ __ ] it
[01:26:02] okay that
[01:26:03] got significantly worse okay uh this one
[01:26:07] this one has to be good attack and crit
[01:26:09] rate it actually can't be bad
[01:26:10] statistically speaking it's impossible
[01:26:11] that's bad
[01:26:14] oh wait attack anchor rate
[01:26:17] ball strap
[01:26:18] I was coping but maybe I was right
[01:26:21] oh maybe I was running not bad not bad
[01:26:29] yeah all right we like it we like it
[01:26:30] good start
[01:26:31] like our silly is not gonna be I mean
[01:26:33] our civil is not gonna be perfect day
[01:26:34] one but you know
[01:26:36] it'll be decent and that's what matters
[01:26:38] uh uh hot visor we don't need to get it
[01:26:41] that high because it's just HP but oh
[01:26:44] that sucks
[01:26:46] if this is hit rate I will literally
[01:26:48] literally lick my microphone
[01:26:52] oh wait why did I get a plus eight
[01:26:54] attention it was nine
[01:26:56] uh effect Rose that's not lucky wait it
[01:26:59] might as well might as well get a 10
[01:26:59] it's literally one from ten bro
[01:27:01] literally One XP off 10 might as well
[01:27:03] oh my God 10 10. sorry
[01:27:06] yo but not this is 15 months is a 14.
[01:27:09] wait I already thanked those subs I'm
[01:27:10] like I swear I've already seen that who
[01:27:12] just oh technology there's five months
[01:27:15] Saul Goodman just followed what up Saul
[01:27:17] how you been man
[01:27:20] big fan
[01:27:22] uh we have no crit rate it's fine we
[01:27:25] have uh it's fine yeah chill chill we're
[01:27:27] gonna we're gonna get we're gonna let me
[01:27:29] 15 this
[01:27:30] you have no [ __ ] crit rates
[01:27:40] patiently waiting for the silver wolf
[01:27:42] guide okay listen I recorded it
[01:27:45] but I have to re-record it because they
[01:27:46] changed the effect rise of enemies okay
[01:27:48] we can't 15 this yet
[01:27:53] how much hit rate do I have I don't care
[01:27:55] what other stats for now
[01:27:56] 56 so if we get the light cone we should
[01:28:00] have enough
[01:28:01] oh can I get the icon or no
[01:28:04] we'll see
[01:28:07] how long does it take is it not oh yeah
[01:28:09] it might take like [ __ ] five days
[01:28:11] we'll see
[01:28:20] boom
[01:28:21] this is the other event right
[01:28:32] what up Arlen correct all the cabins
[01:28:35] they might pass by should we skip or
[01:28:36] listen remember to report to lead
[01:28:38] researcher Asta
[01:28:40] hello
[01:28:44] we'll deal with problems outside the
[01:28:46] base Zone later skip all right it's you
[01:28:49] literally I wanted to get skip you
[01:28:51] didn't know send her yes I did
[01:28:53] this is embarrassing
[01:28:56] we said we okay granted we can get
[01:28:58] another uh how much do we get six so for
[01:29:01] you 18 minus six so 12. we get another
[01:29:04] 12 hit rate off of uh traces alone so it
[01:29:09] should be like it's not too hard to get
[01:29:11] enough but I want to get her event icon
[01:29:13] if I can
[01:29:17] noisy but
[01:29:23] Miss Esther said that grass some big
[01:29:25] [ __ ] Miss Asta said that visit the space
[01:29:27] station today
[01:29:29] and disaster said that the guest appears
[01:29:31] to be Madame hurt his research partner
[01:29:33] if he's doing wait so look at the time
[01:29:37] the guest is almost here
[01:29:41] Chad do we know if it's true
[01:29:44] um
[01:29:45] do we know yet if it's true that
[01:29:49] per her weakness and plant is like
[01:29:51] always like the same odds for every type
[01:29:54] even if you're like three lightning one
[01:29:56] quantum
[01:29:57] still 50 50. we know that's true
[01:30:00] I guess we have enough time to try it
[01:30:02] yet but
[01:30:06] it's the first service
[01:30:11] oh
[01:30:13] you're ready who's that
[01:30:18] oh it's this guy
[01:30:20] thought always proceeds word it's Cypher
[01:30:24] and yet I can't find the words for this
[01:30:27] moment
[01:30:28] [Music]
[01:30:30] it's good to see you Asta
[01:30:33] I apologize I'm four minutes and 13
[01:30:36] seconds earlier than the appointed time
[01:30:37] I hope it's not a bother I'll
[01:30:42] come to her to space station no need for
[01:30:45] formalities Esther hurt a space station
[01:30:47] is where knowledge converges Paul saying
[01:30:49] smash he's a robot quality of thought
[01:30:51] such collaboration between organic life
[01:30:54] forms is magnificent this guy looks like
[01:30:56] that home
[01:30:58] well that sounds lovely but Madame
[01:31:00] hurtis should be in her office so I'll
[01:31:02] take you there
[01:31:03] this way sure
[01:31:06] and you are who's this VA it's me listen
[01:31:09] and you are
[01:31:12] hi I'm Lament
[01:31:14] hello young
[01:31:15] man oh hello lament heart attack she's
[01:31:19] quite curious about you as am I
[01:31:22] what is it like to live in symbiosis
[01:31:24] with a stellaron
[01:31:25] I hope we'll have sufficient time in the
[01:31:27] future to get to
[01:31:30] okay maybe we just what if I just pulled
[01:31:32] for an icon I'm not off to this event
[01:31:36] no no surely not sure
[01:31:39] it's surely not surely not surely not
[01:31:41] truly not
[01:31:45] all right see you later
[01:32:00] this is Arlen's story Quest did no way
[01:32:05] it's the event CBT is a rhyme
[01:32:15] no it's not
[01:32:16] okay but surely it's a prerequisite why
[01:32:18] did it lead me to this
[01:32:20] if it didn't bad game design
[01:32:24] oh wait really why would it leave me
[01:32:26] here then so this
[01:32:28] we need to just
[01:32:34] it didn't
[01:32:36] wait I literally go and then it brought
[01:32:38] me here you have to do it first see yeah
[01:32:40] it's a prerequisite
[01:32:43] okay but surely I don't need the weapon
[01:32:45] now it's fine
[01:32:47] look at this truck in fully Ascender let
[01:32:49] me yeah yeah I gotta stop getting
[01:32:50] distracted
[01:32:54] oh we could do the trial actually good
[01:32:56] take
[01:33:00] and so there's new weaknesses into
[01:33:01] enemies reduce enemy enemy defense and
[01:33:02] type rest applies
[01:33:12] armor attacks are cool
[01:33:23] hey cool
[01:33:27] trickier to crack okay so he has no
[01:33:31] weakness to physical or quantum
[01:33:33] so this should be 50 50.
[01:33:37] it's got a quantum
[01:33:40] shout out to any class of 2023 graduates
[01:33:44] in check less than three also nice
[01:33:54] naughty child
[01:33:56] naughty child
[01:34:01] this combat needs a this is double speed
[01:34:07] um I shredded this will put physical on
[01:34:10] them right yeah
[01:34:22] more enemies
[01:34:26] let's make it quick
[01:34:28] naughty child
[01:34:32] she says it's double speed
[01:34:35] what if he said what if wait is that our
[01:34:36] old voice line I wasn't listening
[01:34:39] gift of all oh well I forgot about this
[01:34:41] I should have cleaned that before
[01:34:42] pulling but it's fine at least we'll get
[01:34:44] another Temple later
[01:34:47] um
[01:34:48] okay
[01:34:52] cool
[01:34:54] okay nice before I forget let me go get
[01:34:56] her level uh let me go get her fully
[01:34:59] ascended so in order to do that
[01:35:01] let's just get we need like a little bit
[01:35:02] of XP books
[01:35:04] so we'll do like [ __ ] three I think
[01:35:06] four four should be fine
[01:35:10] we could put her in but she's not like
[01:35:11] fully geared so it's gonna be kind of
[01:35:13] weird
[01:35:21] Universe Rose yeah you got a [ __ ] ton of
[01:35:23] uh gems for free Jade's it's pretty cool
[01:35:33] what's up
[01:35:37] who's next disappear among the Sea of
[01:35:40] butterflies illusions of the past
[01:35:45] time
[01:35:47] yeah time for a bug is a pretty [ __ ]
[01:35:50] voice line
[01:35:58] illusions of the past
[01:36:00] foreign
[01:36:03] time for a bug wow oh no not a bug
[01:36:17] oh and your misery
[01:36:20] all right go up there should be enough
[01:36:22] to fully level her
[01:36:27] uh I might as well be the no
[01:36:31] oh no okay I didn't like two more
[01:36:35] okay it is I might as well do the thing
[01:36:37] okay I wanted this thing I want to try
[01:36:38] anyways so we might as well be the test
[01:36:40] dummies for this so
[01:36:42] if we do a silver wolf
[01:36:45] Sealy
[01:36:46] King kiwi and fire emcee team I want to
[01:36:51] see if the theory is true that it's
[01:36:53] gonna be a 50 50 implant every time but
[01:36:55] these guys are weak to fires maybe this
[01:36:57] isn't the place to try it right oh this
[01:36:59] guy isn't okay I'll be fine
[01:37:01] so we have to count
[01:37:03] oh it's Auto Battle
[01:37:06] all right that one okay [ __ ] [ __ ]
[01:37:09] it up
[01:37:13] let me put more than one wave
[01:37:19] okay we'll see if it's true or not so
[01:37:21] we'll do the ones that aren't fire week
[01:37:23] one fire and then you just kill him I
[01:37:26] guess
[01:37:37] probably go more
[01:37:42] quantum
[01:37:48] and quantum
[01:37:53] whoa Gamble
[01:38:01] I'll enter misery
[01:38:04] who's next
[01:38:05] time
[01:38:07] Lance at the ready
[01:38:09] when they keep quiet
[01:38:14] okay
[01:38:18] well far is 2-2 but we'll see
[01:38:21] I'll just kill these ones
[01:38:25] can I have fun this time one two three
[01:38:32] wait for the tiles
[01:38:34] okay hopefully I can go again I'll try
[01:38:36] not to kill it with silly
[01:38:40] wait they're both fire week never mind
[01:38:42] it doesn't matter
[01:38:44] yeah it probably is we'll see though
[01:38:47] we'll keep playing it
[01:38:49] all right it's enough XP
[01:38:51] I think
[01:38:52] it might not be let me get some from the
[01:38:53] starter shop
[01:38:57] oops
[01:38:59] yeah that's awesome enough
[01:39:05] all right nice what's that
[01:39:08] all right she's ascended to 80. uh lycon
[01:39:11] basically Max we'll get a better icon
[01:39:13] later but for now it's good uh S3 and
[01:39:17] then we can level her traces a bit more
[01:39:19] I just need to like upgrade my Trace
[01:39:21] materials because I have a lot of blue
[01:39:22] ones and green ones
[01:39:25] I need the hit rate really bad this is
[01:39:27] like really really good and also this is
[01:39:29] really good but I did one 60k credits
[01:39:32] there's also we know this isn't good
[01:39:33] this is three percent but this is good
[01:39:35] wait this is dude this is [ __ ] three
[01:39:37] percent
[01:39:39] dude who designed this look this is good
[01:39:42] don't get me wrong this eight percent
[01:39:44] hit rate is good why is this three
[01:39:46] percent
[01:39:48] like wow three percent
[01:39:56] but it unlocks this and unlocks this so
[01:39:59] yeah
[01:40:02] but it requires character level 75 what
[01:40:05] the [ __ ]
[01:40:06] I don't even know that was a thing
[01:40:08] what the hell
[01:40:10] anyways we need this hit rate thing so
[01:40:12] let's unlock it boom and I should be
[01:40:14] able to make the the purple one
[01:40:21] boom what's the last one attack
[01:40:25] later later later later that's for now
[01:40:29] um I can get maybe another level here
[01:40:31] just get some of these
[01:40:33] uh
[01:40:44] wait I don't have one no I have no
[01:40:47] credits
[01:40:50] wait let me redo my assignments
[01:40:53] oh wait this loads faster now oh that's
[01:40:56] so nice you don't have the animation
[01:40:57] Castle anymore oh my God look at this ah
[01:41:01] it's so nice all right good quality of
[01:41:02] life
[01:41:03] thanks Kenshin
[01:41:04] for funding this
[01:41:12] um
[01:41:13] two percent base chance plus defense
[01:41:16] thread plus damage this has to be the
[01:41:17] worst throwing the level right
[01:41:22] oh this is also nice but yeah it has to
[01:41:24] be this
[01:41:26] all right cool
[01:41:28] okay now we need more hit rate so we
[01:41:30] have to get the two piece that gives us
[01:41:31] hitter eight so we have to do simulated
[01:41:33] Universe five and then memory of chaos
[01:41:35] because I want to clear memory Castle
[01:41:36] there but we need to clear stimulated
[01:41:38] universe
[01:41:40] so that we can get more hit rate on the
[01:41:42] two piece or
[01:41:54] or just changing my artifacts because
[01:41:55] like my my gloves don't have [ __ ]
[01:41:58] any hit rate on them I like this is the
[01:42:01] only one I have that acid rate I mean
[01:42:03] maybe it's worth using just a hit rate
[01:42:04] thing for now because our damage doesn't
[01:42:07] matter until we have enough hit rate
[01:42:10] but
[01:42:12] kind of copium
[01:42:17] yeah
[01:42:19] Audrey you need you want 96 for like the
[01:42:22] hardest content in the game you want
[01:42:24] 96.1 I think right now we have 62 which
[01:42:27] means if we had like her like on it'd be
[01:42:29] enough but yeah for now we still need
[01:42:31] like 20 to 30 well 30 plus percent more
[01:42:34] 35-ish
[01:42:37] um but we can get that
[01:42:41] so let's go do uh
[01:42:44] we could Auto Battle with her before we
[01:42:45] decided Universe let's Auto Battle like
[01:42:48] oh you can do a relic it's all about a
[01:42:49] relic
[01:42:51] run
[01:42:55] should do Quantum chat yes all right
[01:42:57] there's a condom
[01:42:59] wow thanks chat let's do Quantum wait
[01:43:03] your team is too underpowered oh [ __ ] yo
[01:43:06] okay if I die it's not so world's fault
[01:43:08] okay it's fine we can implant the
[01:43:10] weakness Chillin so we'll do Sealy
[01:43:12] silver wolf uh Bilu and then healer I
[01:43:16] mean shielder
[01:43:17] should be fine because now we're
[01:43:19] guaranteed to implant Quantum wait no
[01:43:20] are we what does she weak to yeah we are
[01:43:23] we are
[01:43:26] right now this team kind of sucks
[01:43:27] probably brania
[01:43:32] or Ting Yoon actually but tingy's gonna
[01:43:34] die ibranya
[01:43:41] if I lose this I'm actually never
[01:43:43] playing this game again on SEC chat I'm
[01:43:46] just gonna record it because I need
[01:43:47] background footage
[01:43:49] but I lose this I'm never playing the
[01:43:50] game again just so you know just so you
[01:43:52] guys know just so everyone knows wait
[01:43:54] this is a single Target who the [ __ ]
[01:43:56] died wow
[01:43:58] so I said finally shut the [ __ ] up if I
[01:44:01] lose this yo dude
[01:44:06] okay we brought it out here
[01:44:12] this should one shot if this is a one
[01:44:14] shot GG illusions of the past nice and
[01:44:18] then are you here
[01:44:21] nice sorry he does
[01:44:27] and then
[01:44:33] let me set your wounds
[01:44:38] all right boss time
[01:44:41] this is where a silver wolf does get
[01:44:42] better so we'll start by killing the
[01:44:46] battle
[01:44:55] yeah that's fine uh we'll just do no
[01:44:57] attacks good point can we do this
[01:45:00] this should put Quantum weakness yes and
[01:45:03] now wait I don't have enough skill
[01:45:04] points
[01:45:05] [Music]
[01:45:08] it's fine surely normal attack kills
[01:45:09] here surely surely surely surely surely
[01:45:12] [ __ ] I don't listen I didn't crit plus I
[01:45:15] don't level my normal attacks so it's
[01:45:16] not my fault
[01:45:21] listen I haven't finished leveling
[01:45:23] silver uh Silly's normal attacks that's
[01:45:24] not my fault not my fault
[01:45:27] fine you guys here ah no attack here
[01:45:33] I'm not gonna alt cause I'm gonna wait
[01:45:36] for Brian buff wow that look so smart
[01:45:38] true look at this well
[01:45:48] illusions of the past I didn't I didn't
[01:45:51] quit
[01:45:55] foreign
[01:46:03] please don't resist it
[01:46:13] nice oh my wait what the [ __ ] why do we
[01:46:17] do so much brake damage
[01:46:18] oh two gloves wait that's actually
[01:46:20] really good also this new layout looks
[01:46:22] clean
[01:46:23] wait why do we do so much brake damage
[01:46:25] is that I actually don't know
[01:46:36] ah [ __ ] if that was hit rate wasn't so
[01:46:39] good speeding creates still not bad but
[01:46:41] I don't know domain Buffs it that's what
[01:46:43] I was thinking I was like maybe it does
[01:46:45] but maybe it's just Quantum break let me
[01:46:47] see
[01:46:48] oh yeah it does okay thank God thank
[01:46:49] [ __ ] I was gonna be like no way okay
[01:46:51] thank God okay cool
[01:46:57] all right we go again actually do we
[01:46:58] need to go again
[01:46:59] [Music]
[01:47:01] let's go again one more time
[01:47:07] for a bug
[01:47:10] thank you
[01:47:12] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[01:47:14] that's the worst voice line
[01:47:24] [Music]
[01:47:26] there's a muscle must pull question mark
[01:47:29] worth it question mark listen it's kind
[01:47:31] of early but I think muscle no worth it
[01:47:34] sure just replaceable with pillow but it
[01:47:36] seems pretty good but we'll see uh it's
[01:47:38] still early I often I haven't done
[01:47:39] memory of chaos yet I'm gonna do memory
[01:47:40] chaos after we're gonna do okay here's
[01:47:42] the plan we're gonna do this so that we
[01:47:44] can like
[01:47:45] you're hurt but which is basically cured
[01:47:47] but might as well try and then
[01:47:50] I'm gonna do one or two simulated
[01:47:51] Universe runs to get [ __ ] the Rope we
[01:47:53] want or the ball we want I'm already
[01:47:55] very close
[01:47:59] uh I'm gonna save all my abilities
[01:48:07] this battle is unavoidable
[01:48:11] run silverwolf with Pila regi okay about
[01:48:13] why
[01:48:15] oh [ __ ] I thought you would die
[01:48:18] like you can but also why
[01:48:21] what has entered the storm
[01:48:24] to guard and defend crush them don't
[01:48:27] mess with me
[01:48:30] this combat needs Optima this is double
[01:48:33] speed
[01:48:35] what a headache uh I don't think I
[01:48:37] altered I'm gonna chill actually I want
[01:48:40] to try something so this should
[01:48:41] guarantee quantum
[01:48:45] wait
[01:48:47] oh it resisted it right
[01:48:51] [ __ ] up it resisted it right
[01:48:54] I might not have enough hit rate yeah
[01:48:56] okay dude
[01:48:59] dude yeah yeah I didn't yeah
[01:49:05] wait does it not show the thing when it
[01:49:07] resists or is it like a chance on the
[01:49:10] skill because I didn't level it all the
[01:49:11] way
[01:49:14] oh yeah [ __ ] all right whatever I don't
[01:49:17] get it uh it's fine
[01:49:23] here among the Sea of butterflies
[01:49:25] illusions of the past
[01:49:32] foreign
[01:49:48] [Music]
[01:49:55] [Music]
[01:50:10] no
[01:50:12] I'm pretty sure it can't be a weakness
[01:50:14] already have it's always going to be uh
[01:50:16] yeah it can't like you can't so like
[01:50:18] here is guaranteed to be wind unless
[01:50:19] they resist it it's guaranteed to be
[01:50:21] wind see don't pay for this
[01:50:25] this combat needs
[01:50:27] this is double speed
[01:50:30] always a weakness this is double speed
[01:50:39] I got the like on Yo congrats still
[01:50:42] using the event one sorry sorry that's
[01:50:44] not true not true I mean it used to be
[01:50:45] true but now it's like less true it's
[01:50:47] still I mean yeah yeah battle is
[01:50:49] unavoidable lend me your strength
[01:50:52] don't mess with me okay we're gonna
[01:50:53] unleash here we're gonna whip it out
[01:51:04] I'll free you disappear among the Sea of
[01:51:07] butterflies illusions of the past
[01:51:10] oh nice
[01:51:16] wait criterate with effected right could
[01:51:18] be good could be good could be dog [ __ ]
[01:51:20] but could be good
[01:51:22] could be good affected recruiter it
[01:51:24] could be good could actually be good uh
[01:51:26] we need the hit rate icon to make this
[01:51:27] work though we don't have it yet but
[01:51:29] we'll get it with the event so it could
[01:51:30] be good
[01:51:31] let's look at the four star ones because
[01:51:33] why not
[01:51:34] it's honestly not bad but
[01:51:37] cope
[01:51:39] I thought that cope not that coat what
[01:51:41] if the last status crit damage that has
[01:51:42] hit rate anchor damage then what yeah
[01:51:44] then what then you look like a fool for
[01:51:46] Saint cope
[01:51:54] wait what the [ __ ] is this oh
[01:52:00] uh okay let's go do Universe right now
[01:52:03] let's do Universe because I want to do
[01:52:05] memory of chaos but first we have to the
[01:52:06] universe because I need the hit rate set
[01:52:07] because my silver wolf kind of sucks
[01:52:09] because I don't have enough hit rate so
[01:52:11] if we get the set even if it's four star
[01:52:13] it doesn't matter because we just need
[01:52:15] the set
[01:52:20] no time get on event wait really
[01:52:24] that's actually [ __ ] sick if that's
[01:52:26] true
[01:52:39] also chat listen I think to the one
[01:52:42] person that was like she's RNG listen I
[01:52:45] think if your team relies on her hitting
[01:52:47] the one weakness you need then you're
[01:52:49] playing her wrong and you should just do
[01:52:51] this right let's say it's like oh [ __ ] I
[01:52:52] need wind [ __ ] and this is your team oh
[01:52:54] [ __ ] okay you have a team now or like oh
[01:52:56] [ __ ] I need ice and then it's like
[01:52:58] you're chilling but it is what it is
[01:52:59] like you can also do like okay let's say
[01:53:01] let's say let's say you want to play
[01:53:02] let's say you want to do this right
[01:53:03] you're like okay I really need to
[01:53:04] implant Quantum into [ __ ] Kafka I
[01:53:07] need to implant it inside of her so you
[01:53:08] go Sealy bro uh [ __ ] what's her name
[01:53:11] silver wolf right and you're like [ __ ] I
[01:53:12] need Quantum okay then just do like just
[01:53:15] do bronya and then Natasha and now
[01:53:19] yeah sure you might have played bailu
[01:53:21] otherwise but now boom you do that where
[01:53:23] the [ __ ] is Natasha now you're
[01:53:25] guaranteed to implant Quantum every time
[01:53:26] every single time you're guaranteed
[01:53:27] because it can't be wind it can't be
[01:53:28] physical so it's like I feel like it's
[01:53:30] not hard to just play around the [ __ ]
[01:53:32] weaknesses like it's not as random as
[01:53:34] people make it out to be like if your
[01:53:36] whole game plan is like pray that it
[01:53:38] hits the right one then you're kind of
[01:53:40] griefing or reset like Alta four you
[01:53:42] miss Alta four go again is what it is
[01:53:45] or just press e again yeah you waste the
[01:53:48] skill point but whatever
[01:53:50] so yeah I think that would work uh
[01:53:52] granted we're only doing five three
[01:54:00] uh we're only doing five three
[01:54:08] we're only doing five three to farm
[01:54:10] relics so we might leave before Kafka
[01:54:12] because Kafka takes six years uh but
[01:54:15] we'll see this is the team
[01:54:16] you can play this team we can play this
[01:54:18] team this team kind of I mean
[01:54:20] I don't know if I have my Natasha geared
[01:54:22] I can't play bailou
[01:54:25] but I'm gonna just [ __ ] send it
[01:54:28] let's see
[01:54:30] um
[01:54:34] let me send it
[01:54:50] didn't want to kill big Lotto gambo

[01:55:10] it's not double speed we have to dude we
[01:55:12] have to test that
[01:55:13] time
[01:55:14] if I hear time for a bug again I will
[01:55:17] literally
[01:55:18] I'm not gonna say it
[01:55:21] no wait really wait let's try it let's
[01:55:22] try it let's try it
[01:55:24] I don't have my altitude but when we get
[01:55:27] it we'll try it
[01:55:36] what are you saying of course I play
[01:55:37] gotcha games how what does that even
[01:55:39] mean
[01:55:41] I don't even play gotcha games I just I
[01:55:44] didn't get a hunting
[01:55:47] these all suck I mean this
[01:55:49] whatever

[01:56:12] make a fool out of him an example but no
[01:56:15] that's fine watch this we do this fully
[01:56:19] break it right time for a bug
[01:56:21] afraid of me okay I wanna um I wanna
[01:56:24] test the voice line
[01:56:26] let's kill him
[01:56:27] let's do this hopefully I got my ALT
[01:56:30] here I want to test the voice line
[01:56:33] okay wait let's turn double speed off
[01:56:34] we'll see if she still says it
[01:56:37] this combat needs optimizing at this
[01:56:40] speed too slow
[01:56:43] dude [ __ ] you if it's slow she calls me
[01:56:46] too slow if it's too nice [ __ ] like
[01:56:48] this is two times speed dude what are
[01:56:50] you trying to say next
[01:56:52] why is she roasting me
[01:56:54] why is she roasting me man okay we still
[01:56:57] thinking off I mean this is fine we'd
[01:56:59] have to run a shield I don't want to run
[01:57:00] a shield pull up attack we don't have
[01:57:02] that freeze
[01:57:04] I mean
[01:57:07] they suck it doesn't matter it actually

[01:59:24] them look
[01:59:25] Paw Patrol

[02:00:58] hello zionics is she a good pull do
[02:01:01] donuts have holes butterflies does the

[02:01:19] that's what I meant
[02:01:21] oh I double
[02:01:23] I just reset before seeing the reset
[02:01:26] I didn't know you could reset twice
[02:01:28] before okay dude I I double reset okay
[02:01:32] whatever I'm sure that was optimal
[02:01:34] at least we got something good
[02:01:40] I probably shouldn't waste my R but
[02:01:42] it's fun
[02:01:46] this is double speed takes like 20
[02:01:48] minutes to get the light code wait
[02:01:49] really that's it I'm gonna get it
[02:01:52] why is this screen getting darker my
[02:01:53] lamp broke I ordered a new one off
[02:01:55] Amazon but my like desk lamp stopped
[02:01:58] working so we have a bit less light
[02:01:59] unless I open my backlight but the
[02:02:01] backlight kind of sucks balls I can oh
[02:02:03] my God what's happening to my wire I can
[02:02:05] show you guys if I
[02:02:08] I could do this but that's like weird
[02:02:10] it's like weirdly bright isn't this
[02:02:12] worse
[02:02:16] I don't know
[02:02:20] buffer versus debuffer both
[02:02:23] a message from the government of Canada

[02:02:32] I have a hole for blade why did I read
[02:02:34] that some sometimes I have to like not
[02:02:36] read certain chat messages I'm sorry
[02:02:41] definitely better wait really
[02:02:44] wait you're telling me
[02:02:46] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[02:02:49] illusions of the past

[02:02:55] you tell me this is better
[02:02:57] I feel like I'm two lights
[02:03:00] this looks like Vox light mode like I've
[02:03:03] ascended I'm a Heavenly like what is
[02:03:05] happening it looks like I'm in like a a
[02:03:08] donut factory
[02:03:10] that doesn't make sense why do I still
[02:03:11] look okay my cameras make me look
[02:03:13] shorter than I am I promise I'm like six
[02:03:14] foot
[02:03:15] okay not six sorry seven foot

[02:03:26] do you say it like that
[02:03:30] oh
[02:03:31] no comment oh speed is nice current

[02:04:22] here so we do two
[02:04:25] double speed
[02:04:28] then this
[02:04:30] now this implants
[02:04:34] quantums of the past okay 92k
[02:04:42] thank you

[02:05:03] the sea above okay

[02:05:22] don't pay for this lend me your strength
[02:05:25] okay be this wait how's it brought his
[02:05:29] turn
[02:05:30] I use neon Celia Rose Brian's turn
[02:05:34] wait what the [ __ ] just happened bro I
[02:05:38] have no skill points
[02:05:40] okay I don't know what happened this
[02:05:43] game sucks
[02:05:45] hun buff yeah
[02:05:50] well
[02:05:52] oh imperishable victory
[02:05:55] oh doctor's robe
[02:05:57] [Music]
[02:05:58] oh
[02:06:02] stop giving me break effect man Even
[02:06:06] though four star one would be fine but
[02:06:08] like we're not it's fine okay I'm just
[02:06:10] trying to farm relics do you think it's
[02:06:11] faster if I leave now or if I fight
[02:06:12] Kafka this is the first time we do five
[02:06:15] three I don't think we can beat five
[02:06:17] three without Harmony because we used
[02:06:19] Harmony to beat uh abundant sorry I
[02:06:21] don't know if we could beat this I'm
[02:06:23] gonna be real
[02:06:24] I'm Gonna Keep It 659 with you guys I
[02:06:28] don't know if we could beat this
[02:06:34] fight Kafka so I can see you get
[02:06:36] dominated no but we're not gonna lose I
[02:06:39] just don't know if we can win but that
[02:06:40] doesn't mean we're gonna lose
[02:06:42] okay
[02:06:43] I mean it's kind of lucky
[02:06:54] is silver wolf worth it if it's your
[02:06:55] first limited character maybe if you
[02:06:57] have limited brain cells
[02:06:59] she's actually pretty good uh I don't
[02:07:02] know why I just felt like a natural
[02:07:03] answer no but uh she is pretty good I
[02:07:06] just don't know yeah it's kind of early
[02:07:09] to tell but she does seem pretty good
[02:07:10] like replaceable with um
[02:07:16] weakness is like pretty nice you just
[02:07:18] need enough you need enough hit rate
[02:07:20] illusion
[02:07:21] and you need enough
[02:07:24] that's mostly it speed and like energy
[02:07:26] are nice too
[02:07:32] this combat needs optimize this is
[02:07:35] double speed
[02:07:40] time
[02:07:43] for a bug
[02:07:45] don't mess with me wait
[02:07:48] why did it just win twice oh because
[02:07:50] there's no it's already wait but
[02:07:51] couldn't have been physical why the [ __ ]
[02:07:53] did It win twice did you resist one
[02:07:57] I thought that was supposed to happen
[02:07:59] or does he have the map
[02:08:09] I'll enter misery
[02:08:12] who's next boy isn't it a new one every
[02:08:14] hit
[02:08:15] I don't think it could repeat okay let
[02:08:17] me try that again
[02:08:24] wait
[02:08:25] no
[02:08:31] no uh too busy to catch stream recently
[02:08:33] but happy four months
[02:08:43] when Survivor plans another weakness
[02:08:44] Target only the most recent will be
[02:08:46] capped
[02:08:49] the weaknesses of durations are getting
[02:08:51] the same type refreshes the duration oh
[02:08:53] I see
[02:08:55] wait so there's this wait okay we'll
[02:08:58] test that a bit more but
[02:09:08] that means so there's a chance to get
[02:09:10] the same one twice in a row I didn't
[02:09:11] know that
[02:09:12] that's kind of a sad I mean I guess it's
[02:09:14] fog but
[02:09:16] could be such
[02:09:18] speed uh
[02:09:28] uh what do I do bro I pulled silver wolf
[02:09:30] on accident oh [ __ ] quit how do you get
[02:09:33] on accident what do you want Asta you
[02:09:35] already have an Asta Don Hong you
[02:09:37] already have them
[02:09:38] who the [ __ ] the third character's
[02:09:39] serval you [ __ ] have serval well how
[02:09:41] do you get her on accident what were you
[02:09:43] doing did your brother hop on your
[02:09:45] keyboard
[02:09:47] it's not even a good Banner to build
[02:09:48] pity on
[02:09:51] how does that even happen
[02:09:52] gambling addict yeah probably
[02:09:55] unlucky
[02:10:00] but just go yeah it's fine
[02:10:04] sorry I don't know why I did that
[02:10:11] erda
[02:10:13] who wrote or no
[02:10:15] how do I check my curios
[02:10:17] I mean I probably do let's just assume I
[02:10:18] do
[02:10:20] um
[02:10:23] eject the borison or eject the Run
[02:10:31] Gamba on if you win Kafka dude there's
[02:10:33] no way I'm winning against Kafka right
[02:10:36] this is [ __ ] world six difficulty
[02:10:38] three sorry five difficulty three
[02:10:40] there's no way we win
[02:10:52] here yes here
[02:10:55] yeah we do have it okay
[02:10:59] ready when you are
[02:11:02] guys we're definitely losing but we can
[02:11:04] gamble if you want let me give my
[02:11:06] Natasha the good icon though she's on
[02:11:08] the wrong one let's give her time waits
[02:11:10] for no one
[02:11:12] um
[02:11:29] what is there to gamble and they want to
[02:11:30] Gabon if I'm gonna beat Kafka but I feel
[02:11:32] like it's impossible because uh we don't
[02:11:34] have abundance and uh I think we're
[02:11:37] gonna get [ __ ] but we have two
[02:11:38] cleanses two cleanses is nice
[02:11:48] it's so easy to maximum Pros that might
[02:11:50] like oh that's awesome I might go try to
[02:11:51] get it right now then or like not now
[02:11:53] but like in uh in a minute
[02:11:56] three points for doubters whatever we'll
[02:11:58] do again but fine but I don't trust that
[02:11:59] I'm gonna do it but fine will he kill
[02:12:02] Will he win versus Kafka
[02:12:08] yes he amazing no not his fault
[02:12:13] okay you got wait it's already made the
[02:12:15] prediction okay well
[02:12:17] whatever
[02:12:21] all right will I win
[02:12:25] honestly I've never lost anything in my

[02:16:19] your assistance is Timely
[02:16:22] these nuts
[02:16:28] because it's good but because blade is
[02:16:31] in the background of it based
[02:16:34] why are all of my characters [ __ ]
[02:16:36] debuffed
[02:16:38] okay look at this
[02:16:41] and we cleanse
[02:16:43] uh let's close ourselves that's better
[02:16:51] oh
[02:16:54] I have to do this kind of a waste but I
[02:16:57] have to
[02:16:58] okay so whenever I actually think one of
[02:17:00] those like I'm not even coping what the
[02:17:02] [ __ ] happened to my HP
[02:17:06] who's next
[02:17:08] okay I know brownish would probably
[02:17:09] cleanse herself here but I don't want to
[02:17:11] so we're gonna do this
[02:17:13] then all
[02:17:15] the storm to guard and defend crush them
[02:17:19] I'll freeze disappear among the sea
[02:17:21] above this should be good illusion
[02:17:24] yeah I know def shred because our silver
[02:17:26] wolf is dead then we use our basic
[02:17:28] attacks we can heal
[02:17:30] do I cleanse brawny or do I heal
[02:17:33] um
[02:17:35] I have to heal
[02:17:38] thousands
[02:17:42] stop killing your wife okay this game
[02:17:44] sucks okay listen we tried it is what it
[02:17:47] is I didn't expect we would win it's
[02:17:49] fine listen if I didn't do anything
[02:17:52] wrong okay it happens it happens it
[02:17:54] happens it happens it happens it happens
[02:17:56] it happens okay we're not level 80 we're
[02:17:59] we're under leveled under geared
[02:18:02] underdressed it's fine it's fine okay
[02:18:05] it's fine let's get um uh HP boost wow
[02:18:10] here we go again
[02:18:12] we'll do my red cows after but I need to
[02:18:14] get some uh like one or two relics per
[02:18:17] you idiot
[02:18:20] well is your Natasha HP so low because
[02:18:21] we play bailu but also she's level 16
[02:18:24] we're fighting level 80s
[02:18:25] so like
[02:18:27] could I get her level 80 yes do I want
[02:18:30] to
[02:18:31] I mean
[02:18:32] also my Natasha Natalia Natalie is on uh
[02:18:37] speed boots
[02:18:39] so I could go full HP it's just because
[02:18:40] I want to Fleet of the Ageless which
[02:18:42] needs speed
[02:18:49] there you go boom E2
[02:18:54] here we go again
[02:18:57] go again we're gonna try to get some
[02:18:59] good uh relics boom speedrun
[02:19:03] there goes my mortgage bro it's Channel
[02:19:05] points also that's your first time chat
[02:19:08] there's no way you know what I don't
[02:19:10] want to talk about it we're gonna go
[02:19:11] coin of Discord
[02:19:15] [ __ ] this guy
[02:19:23] uh I don't want to think so we're gonna
[02:19:25] Auto Battle
[02:19:26] this is double speed
[02:19:33] why is he not playing by Lou because
[02:19:37] I don't know I just wanted to go
[02:19:40] um Natasha because
[02:19:42] uh silver wolf [ __ ] Kafka has a physical
[02:19:45] weakness which means silver wolf can
[02:19:46] implant Quantum every time without fail
[02:19:48] but it's probably still better to just
[02:19:50] go [ __ ] also we need two cleanses
[02:19:52] that's why I forgot but that's why we
[02:19:53] need two cleanses
[02:19:55] but my my she's kind of under leveled
[02:19:57] and I don't really feel like leveling
[02:19:59] her but maybe I should
[02:20:01] where the [ __ ] am I going
[02:20:05] does silver wolf have no belly button
[02:20:07] thinkage okay why is that something you
[02:20:10] noticed
[02:20:19] does that have silver implant Works yes
[02:20:22] so look
[02:20:24] unless this guy was already physical
[02:20:25] weakness
[02:20:27] I wasn't looking
[02:20:29] but yeah
[02:20:37] all of my knowledge on her comes from
[02:20:39] CBT though so if they changed anything
[02:20:41] like
[02:20:42] I might be wrong
[02:20:44] but like look here so here it should
[02:20:46] only be either Quantum or uh winds
[02:20:53] when is cooking Street
[02:21:02] unlucky they suck
[02:21:04] ah this
[02:21:11] yeah so look like if this guy so this
[02:21:13] guy is weak to physical and Quantum
[02:21:15] right wait never mind yeah this guy is
[02:21:17] so in theory this should 100 be wind
[02:21:20] yeah
[02:21:22] but that's just a theory a game
[02:21:32] I'm not trying to kill here I'm just
[02:21:33] trying to like make sure
[02:21:39] okay uh
[02:21:45] hunt thank you
[02:21:50] foreign
[02:21:58] normal speech is like too slow or
[02:22:01] something
[02:22:06] corpora money
[02:22:16] don't bet hastily dude oh wait no I
[02:22:19] should win it let's find 100 100 we're
[02:22:20] fine
[02:22:21] I forgot what that was but 100 is good
[02:22:22] hundreds are good actually good take I
[02:22:24] actually could take uh we do this and
[02:22:26] then we do this
[02:22:35] hey so look
[02:22:38] it's been an energy drink should I do it
[02:22:39] or is that a bad take Chad
[02:22:41] but yeah so like here this is guaranteed
[02:22:44] to be quantum
[02:22:48] music's really quiet is it
[02:22:50] like this should be guaranteed Quantum
[02:22:52] here
[02:22:54] because it can't be
[02:23:04] can't be
[02:23:05] fine press shot
[02:23:07] yeah always a weakness
[02:23:09] okay fine
[02:23:11] well Auto Battle I'll open one it's kind
[02:23:13] of not that cold anymore though because
[02:23:15] it's been sitting here for two and a
[02:23:16] half hours
[02:23:19] of the past
[02:23:22] how many implants can there be one at a
[02:23:24] time so the only thing I wasn't aware of
[02:23:27] is apparently and other civil players in
[02:23:30] track can confirm if this is true
[02:23:31] apparently you can get let's say there's
[02:23:33] like let's say it's 50 50 to get wind or
[02:23:35] Quantum and you get Quantum apparently
[02:23:37] the next one could be Quantum again I
[02:23:39] thought after the first Quantum the next
[02:23:40] one would be wind but I think it's 50 50
[02:23:42] still
[02:23:44] um but other than that yeah
[02:23:48] true okay cool good to know
[02:23:52] um
[02:23:53] what is this
[02:23:55] Beauty this is also pretty good but
[02:24:07] wait I literally didn't even get a
[02:24:09] single thing of the [ __ ] set I want
[02:24:10] all right
[02:24:21] should we download it we can download by
[02:24:23] Lucas you need her oh we're probably not
[02:24:24] playing by Lou but whatever
[02:24:30] that is if you don't have another healer
[02:24:32] or Japan you probably won't do a trip
[02:24:33] but if not uh uh we'll see
[02:24:36] wait was that a waste no it's not
[02:24:37] because we have Galactic big Lotto Gamba
[02:24:42] so rules guide when uh
[02:24:48] probably change the way effect res works
[02:24:49] so I have to redo all of it all good
[02:24:51] though mysterious code is really good
[02:24:52] boom damage percent
[02:25:08] next
[02:25:12] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[02:25:17] there you go
[02:25:33] okay
[02:25:34] what's happening over here what if Lotto
[02:25:36] pops here and I'm at one percent HP
[02:25:39] I think buying the oh no no cold we got
[02:25:42] it
[02:25:46] okay let me turn auto battle off here
[02:25:47] first we press r
[02:25:52] then we implant wind into the sky for no
[02:25:54] reason at all
[02:25:56] time for a bug double speed
[02:26:01] so you are afraid of me
[02:26:06] is there a max amount of weaknesses that
[02:26:08] enemy can have
[02:26:10] lend me your strength
[02:26:14] six
[02:26:17] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[02:26:20] illusions of the past more enemies
[02:26:26] I'm press shot what no I'm not saying
[02:26:30] implanted I know imposite is one but I'm
[02:26:32] saying just overall
[02:26:40] s balls why not make you laugh I don't
[02:26:45] know all into misery
[02:26:47] so you are afraid
[02:27:01] uh maybe this isn't worth for Kafka
[02:27:03] maybe for Kafka we do like
[02:27:06] I'll just take it whatever I don't care
[02:27:07] about Kafka
[02:27:15] you took the bait
[02:27:17] oh wait that was what the [ __ ] wait that
[02:27:19] was actually good
[02:27:21] um
[02:27:28] don't mess with me
[02:27:33] all right nice
[02:27:35] give me something nice okay nothing nice
[02:27:38] uh this no this no these all are useless
[02:27:54] I wasted money for my [ __ ] robe I
[02:27:57] have like two Heroes that scale on money
[02:27:59] I bought a curio it's just a dab I got
[02:28:02] nothing out of it except that right
[02:28:04] before a [ __ ] Elite okay I mean
[02:28:10] thank you
[02:28:15] I really want to click this like really
[02:28:18] badly
[02:28:21] [ __ ] it
[02:28:23] that's actually worse that's actually
[02:28:24] worth surely that's worth sure that's
[02:28:26] worth
[02:28:27] ready when you are is there a healing
[02:28:29] thing anywhere please
[02:28:38] show your courage
[02:28:44] I'll be fine
[02:28:56] oh that was so little
[02:28:59] we've entered the storm
[02:29:04] this combat needs optimizing
[02:29:06] speed
[02:29:08] okay
[02:29:11] dude don't kill my
[02:29:13] crack
[02:29:18] wait was it skill punishment or no I
[02:29:20] wasn't looking wait what am I getting
[02:29:21] punished for
[02:29:23] oh it's a view attacker yeah
[02:29:26] yo yo
[02:29:34] here among the Sea of butterflies
[02:29:36] illusions of the past
[02:29:42] what a headache [ __ ] I have to attack
[02:29:46] foreign
[02:30:08] did Big Lotto actually [ __ ] me up
[02:30:17] next thing
[02:30:19] yeah I mean we should probably just go
[02:30:21] do some Universe anyways
[02:30:23] um
[02:30:25] I'm in memory of chaos I just I want to
[02:30:27] get the [ __ ] two pieces of the hit
[02:30:28] rate set but we still didn't get even
[02:30:30] like an attack percent break rope I
[02:30:32] don't even need energy like energy is
[02:30:33] better but even if I just get like the
[02:30:35] um attackers at one I'm chilling but
[02:30:38] we're not even getting that so one more
[02:30:44] wait Josh should I do abundance or are
[02:30:46] you guys gonna fall asleep
[02:30:50] we can also do a leash uh not Elation
[02:30:52] can we also like freeze her can we do um
[02:30:54] remembrance and freezer
[02:31:07] yes
[02:31:10] okay but can I do remembrance without
[02:31:12] should I just play Sealy or should I go
[02:31:14] yanking
[02:31:16] do I need Yan changer characters to
[02:31:18] silly oh and my answering is honestly
[02:31:20] good
[02:31:21] wait what did I just do wait how the
[02:31:23] [ __ ] did I start something
[02:31:25] all right whatever I'll download him
[02:31:36] all right well I meant to go yenching
[02:31:38] but it's fine silly works
[02:31:47] you don't need him yeah but I mean I
[02:31:49] guess we might he's also Better Built
[02:31:51] than my Sealy to be fair he has pretty
[02:31:53] good stats like myself like mid but my
[02:31:55] answer is actually good illusions of the
[02:31:58] past
[02:32:01] El usually does better because still is
[02:32:03] broken
[02:32:04] wait so we're going for remembrance
[02:32:05] right
[02:32:07] why am I only getting hot
[02:32:09] um I mean you know this is good
[02:32:15] okay
[02:32:17] that's good
[02:32:34] battle over
[02:32:35] it's drover
[02:32:37] uh I've forgot to use their ultimate the
[02:32:39] settings to apply ice weakness
[02:32:42] that's good for yanching
[02:32:46] I mean it's just good in general for our
[02:32:48] [ __ ] R right so this is good
[02:32:50] wait but we can implant it never mind we
[02:32:52] can just implant it
[02:33:02] oh this doesn't matter okay
[02:33:12] wait but yeah the new animations are
[02:33:15] cool
[02:33:19] though because we're still running a
[02:33:21] [ __ ] um
[02:33:22] under leveled like everyone well
[02:33:25] supports like our Natasha probably won't
[02:33:26] heal enough
[02:33:27] that's fine
[02:33:37] okay crit rate
[02:33:50] yeah the game's not open world you can
[02:33:51] like explore stuff but it's not open
[02:33:53] worlds
[02:33:55] pretty sure it's more similar to like
[02:33:56] honkai in that uh record
[02:34:02] uh this is good
[02:34:06] it's actually really good
[02:34:09] there's a little bit to Elite so I can
[02:34:10] download [ __ ] Ian
[02:34:18] hit it hard
[02:34:20] oh 150 not bad what's the most you can
[02:34:23] get from that
[02:34:25] the enemy situation has changed show
[02:34:27] your courage
[02:34:30] found
[02:34:41] 400 holy
[02:34:43] you make this uh
[02:34:48] centered the storm
[02:34:49] to guard and defend crush them
[02:34:55] more enemies
[02:34:59] I'll free you from your disappear among
[02:35:02] the Sea of butterflies illusions of the
[02:35:04] past
[02:35:10] kill this
[02:35:14] always a weakness
[02:35:18] lend me your strength
[02:35:22] next
[02:35:28] okay okay
[02:35:30] don't mess with me
[02:35:32] oh cage
[02:35:37] I'll free you from your disappear among
[02:35:39] the Sea of butterflies illusions of the
[02:35:42] past
[02:35:43] which relax that is better for civil if
[02:35:45] not they all suck so go substance not
[02:35:48] Quantum or musk uh call them or
[02:35:50] musketeer probably but the substance
[02:35:51] matter more
[02:35:53] or like main stats I guess
[02:35:57] Quantum set ends up being really good
[02:35:59] when you have a lot of investment
[02:36:01] uh like when you can actually build more
[02:36:03] than just hit rate or like if you're
[02:36:04] just stacking hit rate who the [ __ ]
[02:36:05] cares if you do a bit more damage but if
[02:36:07] you have enough hit rate to be able to
[02:36:08] stop critic [ __ ] then Quantum seven
[02:36:10] comes good
[02:36:12] time time for a bun
[02:36:20] oh nice Association
[02:36:23] oh at least wait I thought we're going
[02:36:24] uh you know I I have money Corporal we
[02:36:27] have a lot of gems we'll do Rob might as
[02:36:29] well immersion boom
[02:36:31] this could be good [ __ ] this could be
[02:36:33] good [ __ ]
[02:36:36] wow
[02:36:37] yeah well that was [ __ ] unfortunate
[02:36:45] okay let's download uh Yan ching

[03:05:02] Natasha is better than bailu because of
[03:05:04] Ronald animation I think it like sways
[03:05:06] them it like makes them want her to be
[03:05:08] better like I know there's like a
[03:05:09] cleanse you know that's great stuff like
[03:05:10] that but I think I think that's part of
[03:05:12] it too
[03:05:14] I think it's because of her alt
[03:05:15] animation there's like probably 60 of it
[03:05:23] is that like the other stuff
[03:05:27] uh okay if I don't get remembrance here

[03:09:43] four star I do not care it could be four
[03:09:44] stars five star [ __ ] one star it

[03:11:10] situation has changed
[03:11:12] show your courage
[03:11:21] okay uh do this then this then this
[03:11:26] question on this Rose actually this
[03:11:28] combat needs up it's optimizing
[03:11:36] how many can you block
[03:11:39] strike the park
[03:11:42] swords descent
[03:11:46] more enemies
[03:11:55] this battle is unless me your strength
[03:11:59] swordplay
[03:12:01] am I able to break her Shield oh we
[03:12:04] didn't get the we didn't get the [ __ ]
[03:12:06] um
[03:12:07] the follow-up attack
[03:12:10] fine
[03:12:13] also fine
[03:12:20] don't pay for this
[03:12:26] I think we tank a hit here because we
[03:12:28] can break the shield yeah
[03:12:31] let me break the shields here
[03:12:36] a one-time enemy
[03:12:43] oh
[03:12:45] dude why do they hurt so much
[03:12:48] Joe
[03:12:50] I forgot my healer kind of under geared
[03:12:52] it's fine though distance is Timely
[03:12:56] oh they resisted it maybe it's not fine
[03:13:00] how many can you block this combat needs
[03:13:02] optimizing this is double speed
[03:13:18] that was all alt actually
[03:13:21] descend
[03:13:26] retribution time for a shot
[03:13:30] this battle is unavoidable
[03:13:34] time for Sword Play
[03:13:41] plink blink
[03:13:46] you'll pay for this
[03:13:52] lend me your strength blink sorry I'm
[03:13:54] trying not to die here I have to think a
[03:13:56] little because they're kind of kind of
[03:13:58] scuffed of a run time for sword kind of
[03:14:01] a very stuffed run
[03:14:03] it's better
[03:14:09] it's double speed
[03:14:21] princess Timely
[03:14:27] this battle is
[03:14:29] dude our run is so [ __ ] bad
[03:14:33] but I blame the cards
[03:14:38] also yanchi never has this passive up
[03:14:40] because this enemy is [ __ ] with us
[03:14:54] how many can you block
[03:14:55] do we die
[03:14:57] I don't think so I think we just do it
[03:14:59] [ __ ] it
[03:15:00] we don't die yeah
[03:15:03] we're just going for relics it doesn't
[03:15:05] matter we're not like we don't need to
[03:15:06] win as long as we
[03:15:07] well I might not actually clear this I
[03:15:09] was gonna say as long as I clear this
[03:15:10] it's fine but I might not because I
[03:15:12] think she out damages my heel no she
[03:15:14] doesn't okay
[03:15:17] all right unlucky whatever I'm in it's
[03:15:19] fine you're so lucky hey up I didn't
[03:15:21] start the Gamba whoever started can pay
[03:15:23] up
[03:15:25] it's fine
[03:15:28] I was just unlucky
[03:15:30] we already beat her though all right
[03:15:31] let's do it let's do mock because the
[03:15:34] thing is I want a [ __ ] energy rope
[03:15:36] because silver wolf can't really get an
[03:15:38] ALT back ever
[03:15:40] but I don't think we need it it's fine
[03:15:42] we'll just do this
[03:15:44] I just didn't want to level these pieces
[03:15:45] without trying
[03:15:48] oh you sound sad because our cars are
[03:15:49] [ __ ] so there's nothing we can do
[03:15:50] about it it's just a waste of like half
[03:15:52] of my life
[03:16:03] okay
[03:16:05] I was probably a waste of plus 12 but
[03:16:07] whatever
[03:16:10] can I have 15 this yet
[03:16:16] nice
[03:16:17] oh we got speed
[03:16:21] okay we're gonna actually just YOLO
[03:16:23] Gamba on something that I shouldn't do
[03:16:27] which is
[03:16:29] our inventory
[03:16:32] and then
[03:16:35] since the Salvage all our [ __ ] five
[03:16:37] stars that we're not gonna use we might
[03:16:39] Camp so you can see what I'm salvaging
[03:16:43] I don't need any of these
[03:17:14] okay
[03:17:17] 300
[03:17:20] all right chat it's [ __ ] gamble time
[03:17:22] what are we gonna get what are we gonna
[03:17:24] do so if I'm smart I should get some
[03:17:26] like some set for my carry but I I want
[03:17:29] to get uh energy rope what are the odds
[03:17:31] that no no there's actually no way I
[03:17:33] think we should just no there's no way
[03:17:35] what should we use it on
[03:17:37] um we can also enter Because if I get a
[03:17:39] inert
[03:17:40] um or a fleet of the Ageless I could use
[03:17:42] it on her too
[03:17:58] I'm really down to send this one though
[03:18:00] but it's definitely a grief
[03:18:09] chat what if I did it what if I did it
[03:18:11] what if I did it
[03:18:12] I shouldn't I mean I could also
[03:18:15] well that was not wait
[03:18:22] I could also just wait and then pick uh
[03:18:24] energy from
[03:18:26] this uh where it is this but that's a
[03:18:29] little [ __ ] 40s that's in like a year
[03:18:45] okay we'll do we'll do one dumb one and
[03:18:48] two Smart Ones so we'll start with like
[03:18:58] we'll start with a smart one okay we'll
[03:19:00] do like
[03:19:01] um
[03:19:03] yeah
[03:19:08] we'll do quality of hands because my
[03:19:09] hands suck balls so this is this is our
[03:19:11] one smart one
[03:19:15] Oh Henry and great okay see that's good
[03:19:18] we did a smart one now I can do a dumb
[03:19:20] one what is the dumb one you ask this
[03:19:21] watch we're about to get energy and I'll
[03:19:23] be worth it
[03:19:24] boom
[03:19:27] wait that's good speed and hitter rate
[03:19:29] wait why the [ __ ] is okay fine energy is
[03:19:31] better but we can use it all right cool
[03:19:33] actually hey hey that's two W's one more
[03:19:37] W and that's a world wide web domain
[03:19:40] maybe I do another one [ __ ] it well dude
[03:19:41] what if I got Quantum right here no but
[03:19:43] like no one else is I mean wealth could
[03:19:45] use it pillow could use it
[03:19:49] [ __ ] it
[03:19:53] okay I was a big greedy I was a big
[03:19:56] greedy I was a bit greedy it is what it
[03:19:57] is I was a big greedy I was a big greedy
[03:19:59] but still not bad for our pillow
[03:20:02] um still not bad
[03:20:06] I don't need this anymore uh 70
[03:20:08] credential attack
[03:20:11] 11 attack these are about as good as one
[03:20:14] another but this one could get better if
[03:20:17] it rolls better
[03:20:18] I don't want to keep both because I want
[03:20:20] to level this one ah whatever let's just
[03:20:22] double it manually
[03:20:27] I only want six
[03:20:35] hey what dude how many good gloves do I
[03:20:37] have okay
[03:20:39] since okay [ __ ] the crit rate one then
[03:20:40] because this one has
[03:20:42] this one's criterate attack this one's
[03:20:44] create attack but also affected rate so
[03:20:46] it's better unless we get really unlucky
[03:20:48] but there's no way we get really unlucky
[03:20:50] so I'm just gonna assume that we're not
[03:20:52] gonna get really unlucky and that this
[03:20:53] is a smart decision
[03:20:56] [ __ ] I mean that's effectra sucks but
[03:20:58] Critter is good oh I mean it's good it's
[03:21:01] good we just want to hit rate but this
[03:21:02] is good it's actually good it's actually
[03:21:03] good uh I don't have enough XP to get it
[03:21:06] to 15 right now but good for now
[03:21:09] lastly let's follow this rope obviously
[03:21:12] energy would be better but it is what it
[03:21:14] is it is what it is
[03:21:22] please give me hit rate speed is good
[03:21:24] but just [ __ ] give me Henry man
[03:21:25] please come on I can't even level it
[03:21:51] okay listen I tried I actually tried I
[03:21:55] tried look look listen I tried to get 96
[03:21:59] hit rate we have how much do we have
[03:22:01] a three listen I tried it's not that far
[03:22:04] off we'll get it eventually uh I think
[03:22:07] we have traces that we yeah we have one
[03:22:09] here that gives us eight percent you
[03:22:12] know that would already be basically 90.
[03:22:14] no more than 90 91.
[03:22:17] so
[03:22:19] it is what it is it is what it is we'll
[03:22:22] get it eventually
[03:22:24] um honestly we might get it now what if
[03:22:27] this at plus 12 gets hit rate boom
[03:22:31] get her icon I don't have Nikon XP it's
[03:22:33] not worth it for me right now it's her
[03:22:34] best four star one but for right now
[03:22:36] it's it would take me
[03:22:38] yeah I literally have no [ __ ] life on
[03:22:40] XP so it'd be like later
[03:22:44] I'd have to use like [ __ ] five to ten
[03:22:46] fuels I don't know if I want to do that
[03:22:50] so yeah
[03:22:54] foreign
[03:23:00] we only need 10.
[03:23:04] unless we change all the relics which we
[03:23:06] could do but
[03:23:16] all right probably chaos time
[03:23:21] um granted we could just buy the battle
[03:23:22] pass this thing gives us so [ __ ] much
[03:23:24] and then if we like level it a little
[03:23:27] bit we might have enough
[03:23:28] so we will probably do it soon probably
[03:23:31] do the event in a little uh because it's
[03:23:33] really good for her it's just like I
[03:23:35] don't know I needed the mouse first
[03:23:37] um I could get more
[03:23:39] I mean this is probably fine for now I
[03:23:40] do want to unlock no this is ass but
[03:23:42] this is good but it costs [ __ ] eight
[03:23:44] bro like what the [ __ ] is this eight
[03:23:47] purple traces no literally wake up Farm
[03:23:49] traces three times to spend your 180
[03:23:52] resin go to bed that's it repeat that's
[03:23:55] all you do wake up Trace sleep repeat
[03:24:05] I like how I [ __ ] I like how she's
[03:24:07] better than my Sealy
[03:24:09] it's fine she doesn't have a we still
[03:24:10] just need a Quantum ball
[03:24:12] uh wait okay this one the ball has hit
[03:24:14] rate I might actually go enter South
[03:24:16] Soto on her if I get her like on I could
[03:24:18] go in her actually
[03:24:20] Soto energy regen row
[03:24:26] dude energy regener ropes are actually
[03:24:27] oh I have one but it's a force wait this
[03:24:30] also has hit rate only three percent
[03:24:32] though
[03:24:33] maybe we do go sasuro I could go south
[03:24:36] Soto
[03:24:37] and we get her light cone I actually
[03:24:39] kind of like that take
[03:24:43] hmm
[03:24:50] I have like five energy regen robes five
[03:24:53] star oh guess what no one asks see you
[03:24:55] in a minute
[03:24:58] sorry I have to take my anger out on
[03:25:00] someone
[03:25:00] I'm sorry
[03:25:02] I'm sorry
[03:25:04] I'm sorry
[03:25:10] you already have to hit it with the
[03:25:11] weapon but it's so Overkill if I get the
[03:25:13] weapon it's like Omega Overkill it's 40
[03:25:15] we need 10. unless I change my whole
[03:25:18] [ __ ] build okay Chad you guys can
[03:25:20] vote do I just [ __ ] send it or do I
[03:25:22] go get the event like on what do you
[03:25:23] guys want to see I don't mind I can do
[03:25:25] the event right now I just don't know if
[03:25:26] it's like if I should do it right now
[03:25:31] thank you
[03:25:35] the weapon's good it is it is good it's
[03:25:37] probably her best um yeah
[03:25:40] better than a stick at e0 note isn't it
[03:25:43] would have been if they didn't change
[03:25:43] how hit rate works so it's not anymore
[03:25:51] dude it takes like five minutes to get
[03:25:52] the icon really
[03:26:07] okay fine
[03:26:10] we'll speed it
[03:26:12] but where is it
[03:26:20] 10 minutes for S1 yeah but people think
[03:26:23] of 20 minutes so Tony this is like
[03:26:24] nothing
[03:26:36] the [ __ ] it's a pattern
[03:26:41] all right I'm Auto battling
[03:26:45] 10 to 20 20 30. all right well probably
[03:26:49] 20. like it would be 20 for a normal
[03:26:50] person but since I'm like arguably
[03:26:52] incredibly gifted not arguably
[03:26:54] objectively incredibly gifted at this
[03:26:56] game it'll take me like like 10 5 10.
[03:27:17] [Music]
[03:27:20] 96.1 that's the that's the sweet spot
[03:27:34] okay
[03:27:37] but look what did you just say listen
[03:27:40] faster
[03:27:45] shot help he answered me but I
[03:27:47] understood nothing I literally said 96.1
[03:27:54] question mark they must be making fun of
[03:27:57] us
[03:28:00] she went towards the base Zone
[03:28:04] did I would be the best NPC voice actor
[03:28:07] when I'm deciphering it what up when
[03:28:10] she must what I do scan or talk to him
[03:28:12] look around
[03:28:17] please don't make me fight something
[03:28:23] what does silver wolf do when you play
[03:28:25] her she says I am the silver wolf and
[03:28:28] then silver wolves all over everyone
[03:28:29] it's actually pretty cool
[03:28:33] the graffiti is located I heard from so
[03:28:36] she's like Pila but I don't understand
[03:28:38] single Target instead of AOE but on
[03:28:39] crack

[03:34:23] don't care what run May said to you but
[03:34:25] there's no chance we're shutting down
[03:34:27] the simulated universe
[03:34:29] I've made my decision question what have
[03:34:33] we invested into this project
[03:34:35] hundreds of system hours the resources
[03:34:37] of an entire and what have we gotten in
[03:34:39] return
[03:34:40] unknowns confusion and a series of
[03:34:43] errors all right in the beginning we
[03:34:46] defined the simulated universe as a
[03:34:48] miniature world that could be used to
[03:34:49] discover the traces of the eons traces
[03:34:52] no it's become something foreign
[03:34:58] like I don't want to listen hear the
[03:35:00] word traces anymore
[03:35:01] I don't mean to I just want to give more
[03:35:04] that's enough leave if you don't want to
[03:35:06] be part of this

[03:36:39] lot
[03:36:44] you are now taking
[03:36:53] notified all of them wait this literally
[03:36:55] simulated universe
[03:36:56] oh it is it literally okay it actually
[03:36:58] is
[03:36:59] yo come take a prime time
[03:37:06] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[03:37:08] illusions of the past lend me your
[03:37:11] strength
[03:37:17] bro wasn't reading reading is for people
[03:37:20] who don't know things like if you know
[03:37:21] everything why would you need to read
[03:37:23] new things true true LOL w
[03:37:27] hmm never mind she's actually on we've
[03:37:31] met Stella run hunt in her it wasn't I
[03:37:34] never thought what seems like we can
[03:37:35] know
[03:37:43] what I can go on occurrence
[03:37:47] be for genius Relic for silver
[03:37:50] okay I have a question
[03:37:55] is there like something I'm missing with
[03:37:57] break effect teams or like at least okay
[03:37:59] kafka's not out yet but as of right now
[03:38:02] is there ever a reason to play a break
[03:38:03] effect team like instead of just going
[03:38:05] the normal [ __ ] build am I missing
[03:38:08] something
[03:38:12] like why the [ __ ]
[03:38:16] why do you ask if you know already
[03:38:18] because maybe I'm missing something
[03:38:19] because I feel like everyone recommends
[03:38:21] the clown set on like so many characters
[03:38:22] like yeah you can use it but like why
[03:38:24] the [ __ ] is like why why am I playing
[03:38:27] break effect
[03:38:28] the [ __ ] am I doing with my life
[03:38:36] maybe when kafka's out but
[03:38:44] it's gonna ask like he's gonna break
[03:38:45] often I mean sure but wouldn't you
[03:38:47] rather just have speed or something
[03:38:48] because your ass is like
[03:38:50] she breaks fast but like it's not like
[03:38:52] she's like it's not like the brake
[03:38:54] damage is that high she came I must have
[03:38:56] I recall but sure like it could be like
[03:38:59] yeah
[03:39:03] I can't talk to her
[03:39:23] I don't want to talk about it
[03:39:28] to prevent them from attacking no no so
[03:39:30] break effect doesn't increase how fast
[03:39:33] you break Shields it's not break
[03:39:34] efficiency it's just more damage from
[03:39:36] the dot after The Shield is broken so
[03:39:38] like I get it if you're spam breaking
[03:39:40] Shield right but like
[03:39:42] I feel like for most characters it's
[03:39:43] like I don't know it's kind of copium
[03:39:46] it's just we don't have a good support
[03:39:47] set yet
[03:39:49] like oh this is like musketeer which is
[03:39:51] like six speed or some [ __ ] percent
[03:39:53] speed or some [ __ ]
[03:39:59] thought improve the action Shields yeah
[03:40:01] no it doesn't break effect is the damage
[03:40:02] after
[03:40:09] disappear or like yeah when you break
[03:40:11] whatever
[03:40:12] illusions of the past
[03:40:14] time
[03:40:20] what is um
[03:40:25] the final result well there miss
[03:40:30] huh I knew it would be hard to fool you
[03:40:33] all that talk you were spouting along
[03:40:35] this guy's got a Dapper it is a joy and
[03:40:39] an honor to have the opportunity to face
[03:40:41] off against you once again
[03:40:45] shutting down the universe that is up to
[03:40:46] you to
[03:40:48] Miss silver
[03:40:49] will truly a talented hacker not only
[03:40:51] did she calculate everything it had news
[03:40:53] of my sudden visit to the space station
[03:40:55] was probably the only uncontrollable
[03:40:58] variable in her plan
[03:41:00] and with my arrival came the nightmare
[03:41:02] of shutting down the simulated universe
[03:41:04] that would have ruined her plans and all
[03:41:06] her preparations
[03:41:08] you could simulate my universe what you
[03:41:11] now know dude what am I saying
[03:41:14] [Music]
[03:41:16] came here out of desperation but I've
[03:41:19] been bursting with excitement this whole
[03:41:21] time do you know how happy I was when
[03:41:23] you showed up I haven't had the thrill
[03:41:25] of a formidable opponent in such a long
[03:41:27] time the legion is she talking like why
[03:41:30] is she like kind of nerd she talks like
[03:41:33] a like a society kind of like Mika I
[03:41:38] haven't had a formidable opponent in so
[03:41:40] long
[03:41:41] of a game if they can't make you happy
[03:41:43] an invitation
[03:41:45] formidable opponent right and I'm
[03:41:48] bringing this with me
[03:41:56] oh why else and I'm looking forward to
[03:42:00] it how do you plan on stopping me this
[03:42:03] time stop skipping I need the light cone
[03:42:05] I need the availability we're almost
[03:42:08] done surely
[03:42:12] Python's not a I like there's a nerd but
[03:42:14] he's hot so he gets away with it he's

[03:42:22] like oh Mika of the Knights of fevonius
[03:42:24] I'll hide them still like hot about it
[03:42:26] he's just a little like he's just like a
[03:42:28] bookworm correction not only is the one
[03:42:30] in your possession a duplicate
[03:42:33] the real curio was transferred elsewhere
[03:42:36] at the very beginning nice [ __ ] attack
[03:42:41] I must warn you it is likely that
[03:42:43] someone would step forward to stop you
[03:42:46] then what if I were to destroy the
[03:42:49] simulated Universe I'm sorry is school
[03:42:51] unplayable yes but only if you prime sub
[03:42:54] to this channel true actually a true
[03:42:56] statement actually true silver wolf okay
[03:43:01] not true but it could have been that
[03:43:02] would have been cool if it was that this
[03:43:04] would be too easy on you and wanted to
[03:43:06] add something of her own and that is why
[03:43:08] in this very moment she has reverse
[03:43:11] hacked you and located all your
[03:43:13] interaustral Network accounts
[03:43:15] a total how would it be if the IPC were
[03:43:18] to freeze all of them how long is this
[03:43:21] cutscene I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[03:43:25] games are always fun in the eyes
[03:43:31] many ways of solving a problem
[03:43:33] it's about time we were on our way
[03:43:42] oh nice oh we got six stickers all right
[03:43:45] cool uh don't they keep talking for the

[03:55:24] or [ __ ] it
[03:55:35] let's see
[03:55:51] oh there's one here
[03:55:53] cool
[03:55:57] simulated all right I can't even read
[03:55:59] that it's truly surely donated one
[03:56:01] dollars task what brand are your glasses
[03:56:05] from I don't [ __ ] know I wear around
[03:56:06] them currently but I have been inspired
[03:56:09] by your style to be a more
[03:56:11] [Music]
[03:56:13] which I don't know
[03:56:22] is it true that subbing will give double
[03:56:25] drops
[03:56:29] who said that
[03:56:35] yep corpora
[03:56:39] this is
[03:56:48] disappear Yes actually
[03:56:51] illusions of the past lend me your
[03:56:54] strength
[03:56:55] who's next
[03:57:07] it's so easy
[03:57:12] okay how much do we get from that wait
[03:57:15] no leave
[03:57:20] hey what oh
[03:57:24] yes
[03:57:28] okay so what just happened
[03:57:33] 200 so now we do difficulty two we get
[03:57:35] another 200 and each 300 is the thingy
[03:57:43] I see
[03:57:45] 200 and 300 then okay cool
[03:57:51] foreign
[03:58:08] weaknesses that the enemy already has no
[03:58:11] that is not true
[03:58:12] unless you they already have every
[03:58:14] weakness that you have civil can repeat
[03:58:15] the same weakness if you it can repeat
[03:58:18] the same weakness if it's a weakness
[03:58:19] that you gave to them so if you have
[03:58:21] wind and Quantum and you gave them wind
[03:58:23] they could you could give wind again
[03:58:27] but if they naturally have wind then you
[03:58:30] can't apply wind to them
[03:58:32] if like you also have another element
[03:58:33] like like Quantum but they don't have
[03:58:50] thanks now I'm more confused okay how is
[03:58:53] that more confusing
[03:59:04] wait so are there any rewards for
[03:59:06] killing more enemies or can I just scan
[03:59:07] and then dip
[03:59:16] not in a scan and dip
[03:59:24] did two wins do anything uh okay so I oh
[03:59:27] I mean you can like refresh the duration
[03:59:29] of the like if you win thing and then
[03:59:31] you win thing again it refreshes the
[03:59:32] duration of the debuff I think that's it
[03:59:43] Elite enemy
[03:59:45] I wonder
[03:59:54] no you can't
[04:00:00] like look
[04:00:03] so here
[04:00:06] it yeah like if I use this here it has
[04:00:08] to be either wind or lighting it can't
[04:00:10] be Quantum there's no way it's Quantum
[04:00:11] see
[04:00:16] good yeah
[04:00:19] foreign
[04:00:21] however here we could get wind again
[04:00:24] because the wind we gave to him so this
[04:00:26] could be wind or lightning
[04:00:31] this is double speed
[04:00:36] Oh I thought that would kill what the
[04:00:39] [ __ ] all right
[04:00:42] so silver roof is like kazua no and
[04:00:44] anyone that says that is
[04:00:46] why the [ __ ] would silver will be like
[04:00:48] Cosmo how the [ __ ] in what world
[04:00:53] literally how
[04:00:57] prescription
[04:01:17] time for a plan don't mess with me
[04:01:20] who's next
[04:01:29] a sharp hair color bro this is not
[04:01:32] Cosmo's hair color
[04:01:41] foreign
[04:01:53] too is that okay let's say let's say a
[04:01:56] new character comes out in style that's
[04:01:57] like broken right
[04:01:58] the thing with cos was he's been broken
[04:02:00] for like two years
[04:02:01] so like for a character to be compared
[04:02:04] to kazua they have to they're gonna have
[04:02:06] to be broken for two years
[04:02:10] and convenient
[04:02:12] on top of just like being really good
[04:02:19] wait how the [ __ ] do you what is
[04:02:21] happening
[04:02:32] laughs
[04:02:35] then what is happening

[04:02:42] have to click this one
[04:03:05] all right this guy's just not looking at
[04:03:06] me
[04:03:17] okay then
[04:03:42] but yeah I mean it's hard to tell how
[04:03:44] good she's gonna be like long term she
[04:03:46] seems like I don't know
[04:03:49] she seems pretty Universal but the thing
[04:03:50] with this game is there's so many
[04:03:51] [ __ ] Universal care like there's so
[04:03:54] many characters you can use in every
[04:03:55] team that it's hard to tell like
[04:03:57] who's actually worth it and a lot of
[04:03:59] times it's like getting it feels like
[04:04:01] you can build your team with just good
[04:04:03] supports this game is a bit more DPS
[04:04:05] dependent I feel like because you kind
[04:04:07] of want different elements

[04:17:01] it's fine okay so
[04:17:03] is this enough to fully refined 550

[04:18:04] oh
[04:18:05] okay
[04:18:07] dude
[04:18:10] how the [ __ ] could I know
[04:18:13] I should be enough
[04:18:16] all right I don't know why we did this
[04:18:19] when I fully leveled another light cone
[04:18:20] before streaming and now I have to level
[04:18:22] a new one so I'm I'm actually broke as
[04:18:24] [ __ ] now but uh there you go
[04:18:28] we can fully superimpose it let me first
[04:18:30] let me might as well finish the other
[04:18:31] screenshots so we need trash can and
[04:18:33] what else just while I'm here so I can
[04:18:35] get the trace mats
[04:18:38] you food order what the [ __ ] is a food
[04:18:40] order robot
[04:18:42] wait there's an image I should have
[04:18:43] looked at Papago wait
[04:18:49] [ __ ] is that
[04:18:59] yo I didn't
[04:19:02] this is Four's dialogue I didn't try to
[04:19:04] okay I got an achievement
[04:19:06] all right
[04:19:11] wait this thing right what is this
[04:19:14] I don't even know what this is but
[04:19:16] whatever
[04:19:22] yeah I need a food robot oh he's here
[04:19:25] ah easy
[04:19:28] all right easy uh arcade challenge boom
[04:19:34] boom
[04:19:50] all right cool
[04:19:53] okay so we have a really good noility
[04:19:55] like on
[04:19:56] but guess what we're not even [ __ ]
[04:19:59] using it on her so I wasted all it's
[04:20:00] good on other characters but like I
[04:20:02] low-key wasted all of my XP my Relic XP
[04:20:05] but that's fine
[04:20:11] okay so we're gonna use this instead
[04:20:14] they're gonna weld here
[04:20:17] dude there's no way I can Ascend this oh
[04:20:20] my God this is gonna take [ __ ]
[04:20:21] forever I mean I might just level I
[04:20:23] might just get the battle pass
[04:20:31] should I call it the Val pass
[04:20:48] well like on a sub Forester so we're
[04:20:50] like better as a roof it depends four
[04:20:52] star this one is more consistent it's
[04:20:54] like more like I usually recommend this
[04:20:56] one but like if you have a five star
[04:20:57] icon it could be an upgrade it's just
[04:20:59] you need enough hit rate like once you
[04:21:01] have enough hit rate the five star icons
[04:21:02] are better but if you don't have enough
[04:21:03] hitter rate this one's better also gives
[04:21:05] you energy
[04:21:07] just depends on how much hitter you have
[04:21:08] once you have enough hit rate that
[04:21:09] damage runs could be better
[04:21:13] I low key have enough hit rate
[04:21:16] low-key I don't I need like
[04:21:19] 16 more No wait it's 96 right
[04:21:29] foreign
[04:21:30] it might be easier for me
[04:21:33] I mean okay if I change light cones I
[04:21:36] could change to this
[04:21:38] or is it I could go Quantum ball
[04:21:42] uh
[04:21:55] when I was a 96 hit rate
[04:21:57] come
[04:21:58] I didn't say that I just
[04:22:01] it's what you want to ensure that you
[04:22:03] are landing your
[04:22:05] uh debuffs against the high level bosses
[04:22:21] the 140 no that was before they changed
[04:22:23] it they changed it dispatch in the patch
[04:22:25] notes
[04:22:26] they changed how much effectors you need
[04:22:28] uh how much how much effect res enemies
[04:22:30] have which means you need a lot less
[04:22:32] effective hit rate so silver is just a
[04:22:34] better character because you could build
[04:22:36] more damage
[04:22:39] foreign
[04:23:13] but they just change the facts like they
[04:23:15] did do some actually that's true I okay
[04:23:18] granted you stopped playing the day
[04:23:19] before a patch so it's not like but yeah
[04:23:22] they did add a few like overlay stuff
[04:23:24] and a few rewards and [ __ ] so it is it
[04:23:26] is nice uh okay let's go
[04:23:29] [ __ ] it I think I want to level the like
[04:23:30] on I just don't know if I can
[04:23:34] oh I'm gonna have to do this how many
[04:23:36] Hillary things do I have
[04:23:38] zero what about the uh blue ones
[04:23:46] but I check the blue ones
[04:23:49] three I mean eight
[04:23:55] okay what if we what about okay what if
[04:23:57] I don't change lightcons
[04:24:01] I'll just use this one it'll be fine
[04:24:09] and then we'll get affected rate on
[04:24:16] you know what we'll be fine we'll be
[04:24:19] fine we'll be fine
[04:24:22] we have to go do memory chaos anyways
[04:24:24] we'll have to do Mario chaos is fine
[04:24:31] would you like to enter the Forgotten
[04:24:32] Hall
[04:24:35] close enough
[04:24:43] okay so memory accounts reset I didn't
[04:24:46] do any of it so we're gonna have to go
[04:24:47] through the early things again I'm
[04:24:48] pretty sure all of my characters are
[04:24:49] geared so we should be fine however
[04:24:51] yanching's weapon could be level 80
[04:24:53] which is something I should be working
[04:24:55] on and
[04:25:00] our world is naked
[04:25:02] so we can't really play welt
[04:25:07] um
[04:25:20] but it's fine
[04:25:31] also I still don't have good
[04:25:33] um
[04:25:36] I don't know if I like speed to level
[04:25:37] this
[04:25:41] wait maybe I have a piece that I've
[04:25:42] locked that I could unlock maybe
[04:25:45] um
[04:25:47] well I'll be able to track something in
[04:25:48] here in one sec
[04:26:19] [ __ ] I can't get 12.
[04:26:25] oh [ __ ] that's good I mean the defense
[04:26:27] uh level is bad but the rest is actually
[04:26:29] good okay
[04:26:31] my bad I want to get this to 12 but I am
[04:26:33] unfortunately broke uh um
[04:26:37] which is probably the most relatable
[04:26:38] part of this stream maybe we could throw
[04:26:41] like
[04:26:43] what am I not using I feel like I have
[04:26:45] like extra [ __ ] I'm not using
[04:27:00] oh
[04:27:04] laughs
[04:27:08] uh I don't actually know
[04:27:11] I guess we don't need to throw anything
[04:27:14] I just really need [ __ ] Relic XP I'm
[04:27:16] broke
[04:27:18] it's too many options
[04:27:22] yeah no it's not really anything we can
[04:27:24] throw
[04:27:29] I guess we'll throw this
[04:27:31] not using this
[04:27:50] gearing yeah I'm just trying to I don't
[04:27:52] know how to get a relic XP without
[04:27:53] spending all my stamina honestly there's
[04:27:55] anything we can throw but like all of
[04:27:56] these balls I feel like I'm using
[04:27:58] I'm a ball collector
[04:28:01] so many balls so little time
[04:28:09] my ceiling's still on a four-star rope
[04:28:11] this is actually a terrible [ __ ] rope
[04:28:13] I don't know why she's on this
[04:28:19] uh I should have a better one
[04:28:22] this one's a bit better I mean this
[04:28:24] one's [ __ ] world HP
[04:28:26] it was better though
[04:28:32] I might as well take it
[04:28:34] might as well take it
[04:28:43] dude I actually need a relic XP I don't
[04:28:45] know if I should go just Farm Relic just
[04:28:47] for [ __ ] Relic XP Maybe
[04:28:52] I [ __ ] you welt
[04:29:07] back to somebody dude but every time I
[04:29:09] want to do memory of chaos I end up back
[04:29:10] at simulated Universe I can't do that I
[04:29:13] can't keep going back do you want to
[04:29:15] enter the Forgotten
[04:29:17] I can't keep going back
[04:29:19] I just want to do memory of chaos man I
[04:29:21] never can
[04:29:32] um
[04:29:33] I feel like we might as well get this I
[04:29:34] play yanching enough it's probably it's
[04:29:36] definitely worth it
[04:29:45] hello balls Lament
[04:29:48] there's also
[04:29:53] hello balls Lament
[04:29:57] s like it's a 16 months that was a lot
[04:30:00] of months that's like more than one
[04:30:07] all right I think we sent a chat ready
[04:30:09] yes sir okay cool is our team Yoon
[04:30:12] healthy enough to not get [ __ ]
[04:30:13] one-shotted let's see
[04:30:15] plus zero ball plus zero rope
[04:30:24] well I might as well go space ceiling
[04:30:26] station
[04:30:35] do you want to enter the forgot
[04:30:39] okay oh wait that's what I want to do oh
[04:30:41] my God I can't [ __ ] start yeah Ching
[04:30:43] is on the wrong rope right yeah it's
[04:30:45] plus six actually I could
[04:31:00] I get this to nine somehow
[04:31:06] okay
[04:31:13] all right nine
[04:31:14] that's all the Falls guys
[04:31:19] what's our game looking like 133 crit
[04:31:22] that Mage oh cage attack we could get
[04:31:24] this to 80 but [ __ ] it let's just go
[04:31:27] do you want to enter do you want to
[04:31:30] enter
[04:31:30] all right it resets round one
[04:31:32] unfortunately this might take a little
[04:31:34] long but
[04:31:36] it's silver wolfing time
[04:31:39] okay so we're gonna do what do we need
[04:31:41] here we want Sealy here we want
[04:31:47] does your head look like a chocolate ice
[04:31:50] cream cone it does not
[04:31:58] uh
[04:32:07] what I feel saying true is literally not
[04:32:09] true
[04:32:12] literally not true
[04:32:15] oh what's really nice about this team is
[04:32:17] we could do
[04:32:18] silly
[04:32:20] silver wolf
[04:32:22] and then this so this girl has [ __ ]
[04:32:24] Quantum weakness right this one doesn't
[04:32:25] but we could just go double lighting or
[04:32:27] win lightning and then guarantee the
[04:32:29] quantum so we could do like brania bailu
[04:32:32] and then it guaranteed implements and
[04:32:34] then second half we do [ __ ] like
[04:32:36] yanching
[04:32:40] foreign
[04:32:53] like like this or something and then we
[04:32:56] just no we probably won't I don't know
[04:32:58] actually jingyon's probably better here
[04:33:00] probably this and then we like this guy
[04:33:02] we this guy we brewed for us probably
[04:33:13] or we did this and then we just
[04:33:15] alternate our DPS
[04:33:28] well we lost a silver wolf second half
[04:33:31] all right but I'm overthinking this and
[04:33:33] I just saw a little second off
[04:33:41] oh yeah I think I'm overthinking this is
[04:33:43] my done hung geared I think he is right
[04:33:47] yeah I mean good enough
[04:33:51] yeah
[04:33:52] yeah let's do that
[04:33:59] I think I overthinked it we'll just do
[04:34:00] uh we'll do a silly
[04:34:02] Quantum and then lightning lightning so
[04:34:05] Sealy Quantum lightning lightning that
[04:34:07] means Ting Yoon and
[04:34:10] Bilu and then first off we'll do
[04:34:12] Dan Hong brania
[04:34:18] Natalie and then Levant so we don't die
[04:34:21] I don't think we need fire emcee but
[04:34:23] might as well
[04:34:29] yeah I agree good take
[04:34:38] it certainly isn't friendly this will
[04:34:41] strengthen our position
[04:34:45] how many Silverado we use a lot of
[04:34:47] tickets against the roof like a lot we
[04:34:49] were on Auto Battle oops like like I
[04:34:51] think we went soft pity twice probably
[04:34:55] wait why am I solo HP do I not have a
[04:34:58] [ __ ] flower a [ __ ] headpiece well
[04:35:00] it's gone 6 hp
[04:35:03] whatever
[04:35:06] don't worry about it's unavoidable
[04:35:10] lend me your strength
[04:35:12] the truth of life and death is sanctuary
[04:35:15] is but a vision okay
[04:35:24] fighting is meaningless
[04:35:27] the sanctuary is but a vision
[04:35:31] sorry that was weird
[04:35:37] I might also be able to
[04:35:39] not on the crit raid light cone I might
[04:35:41] not have enough crit rate
[04:35:43] yeah I mean yeah that's fine
[04:35:46] whatever whatever brother uh is this
[04:35:50] worth it
[04:35:52] wait is this yeah she's slowed so I
[04:35:54] should be able to get my health here and
[04:35:55] then we get to all 12 still being buff
[04:36:07] s did I keep rolling over my wire
[04:36:12] yo this [ __ ] is like Omega Tangled oh
[04:36:15] whatever I don't even care anymore all
[04:36:17] right wait I actually do care this thing
[04:36:19] is like okay wait
[04:36:21] how does this even happen
[04:36:23] there's like six layers of tangle to it
[04:36:32] all right whatever
[04:36:33] I'll figure out later
[04:36:35] let's take my headset off at some point
[04:36:37] what the [ __ ] happened
[04:36:45] sagacious discernment oh
[04:36:49] uh I should probably all before the next
[04:36:51] fight might as well heal up
[04:36:59] oh [ __ ] we're gonna do another turn
[04:37:04] it's fine we should have win this turn
[04:37:06] you'll pay for
[04:37:08] or not
[04:37:09] lend me your strength
[04:37:13] oh
[04:37:14] the truth of life and death is sanctuary
[04:37:17] is but efficient
[04:37:21] that's all
[04:37:29] I have no interest in conflict we kind
[04:37:32] of [ __ ] up the order uh but we should
[04:37:33] still be able to kill here
[04:37:36] what fun
[04:37:41] I should kill
[04:37:44] okay one more
[04:37:53] Zion says NPC in Keck L how am I npcing
[04:37:57] when I'm focusing
[04:37:59] I'm sorry I want to get good good clears
[04:38:03] in
[04:38:06] watch we slowed her now what we're gonna
[04:38:08] do we started now what we're gonna do is
[04:38:11] is is this is the watch we're gonna buff
[04:38:13] our dad hung and now with the buff we're
[04:38:16] gonna watch on her watch us okay we
[04:38:17] don't have our full buff but still so
[04:38:19] she slowed him 23k
[04:38:24] sheesh
[04:38:28] fine
[04:38:30] Lance forward
[04:38:40] to guard and defense refresh them
[04:38:43] fighting is meaningless
[04:38:52] there we go again
[04:38:55] hello go here
[04:38:58] time for a shot
[04:39:05] okay
[04:39:06] uh
[04:39:12] she slowed she is that means we can do
[04:39:15] this so we bought for Dan Hong and then
[04:39:17] we all
[04:39:19] interesting conflict Marshall waited for
[04:39:23] bronia though but fine yeah actually
[04:39:25] Brian I also didn't quit lucky
[04:39:30] unavoidable
[04:39:32] there it is
[04:39:52] oh she's not slowed
[04:39:56] fine I have no interesting
[04:40:01] the truth of life in this Sanctuary I
[04:40:05] think we die though oh my God I didn't
[04:40:07] create oh can I please quit please I
[04:40:12] think we win I think we won yeah
[04:40:19] we minus one turned that's fine we're
[04:40:21] still gonna win but that was [ __ ]
[04:40:23] stupid
[04:40:27] there isn't sufficient disk space to
[04:40:29] continue recording
[04:40:32] okay Chad I need to uninstall something
[04:40:34] what the [ __ ] can I uninstall
[04:40:36] wanna spar
[04:40:45] gun [ __ ] I'm not uninstalling gentian
[04:40:48] I'm not uninstalling genshin
[04:41:01] an assault Xbox game bar
[04:41:08] enemies ahead up for a scrap
[04:41:13] uh we'll start with this dude I'm
[04:41:15] actually low-key very afraid
[04:41:18] because we kind of wasted a few turns in
[04:41:20] the first half so I don't even know if
[04:41:21] we can three side this anymore but
[04:41:22] surely we can
[04:41:25] as long as I don't [ __ ] this up
[04:41:27] so we're gonna do this
[04:41:33] this
[04:41:35] [Music]
[04:41:38] should be fine
[04:41:51] illusions of the past
[04:41:53] oh nice
[04:41:56] next
[04:41:57] it's fine
[04:42:00] he's the moment
[04:42:02] yeah can I have fun this time
[04:42:08] okay we just do e here wait death shred
[04:42:11] okay actually actually this guy double
[04:42:14] speed
[04:42:17] then we eat this guy kill reset eat this
[04:42:21] guy because he's def shredded
[04:42:22] nice let me see the turn okay really
[04:42:24] good we wanted like [ __ ] one turn
[04:42:25] that's actually super good literally one
[04:42:28] turn
[04:42:31] um
[04:42:43] trickier to crack
[04:42:47] Quantum Quantum Quantum it's actually
[04:42:50] guaranteed yeah
[04:42:54] [Music]
[04:43:04] I don't know why I didn't just alt
[04:43:06] actually I don't know why I waited
[04:43:07] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[04:43:09] illusions of the past
[04:43:17] he's the moment yeah more enemies
[04:43:22] oh my little small attack
[04:43:27] fun
[04:43:31] nice oh and your misery
[04:43:36] oh I could have altered and saved a turn
[04:43:37] but it doesn't matter we win
[04:43:42] okay first one's done it's a pretty easy
[04:43:45] one but you know it's done uh here I can
[04:43:48] use yanjing or Jin Yuen actually
[04:43:52] or both maybe [ __ ] silly
[04:44:06] so second off we're gonna do Yen Ching
[04:44:08] origin actually no just checking out
[04:44:09] this genuine for sure
[04:44:12] because they're all weak to [ __ ]
[04:44:13] Electro but they're also all weak to ice
[04:44:23] well that'll not play Silly just because
[04:44:25] I don't know I feel like we usually use
[04:44:27] her as like a crutch like we kind of
[04:44:28] depend on silly but
[04:44:37] so it'd be like yeah ching
[04:44:41] bronya
[04:44:46] Natalie
[04:44:49] and then fire EMC and then second off
[04:44:51] would be Jin Yuen Ting Yoon
[04:44:56] silver wolf
[04:45:01] um someone's probably better here
[04:45:08] but yeah
[04:45:11] and then bailou
[04:45:15] dude this is so dude look at our skill
[04:45:17] point efficiency
[04:45:19] we're the goddess skill points
[04:45:22] all right so here's what we do here's
[04:45:24] what we do boom
[04:45:28] boom
[04:45:30] that was a waste it's fun
[04:45:33] how did I attack that oh good
[04:45:35] who's Natalie it's Natalie help me
[04:45:38] improve
[04:45:39] who is it Natalie
[04:45:41] everyone knows Natalie
[04:45:43] this battle is unavoidable this battle
[04:45:46] is unavoidable sorry
[04:45:50] I don't know isn't that
[04:45:53] I could have altered
[04:45:56] towards descent
[04:46:03] it's time
[04:46:11] nice good damage from yanching
[04:46:20] I actually didn't think we would get it
[04:46:33] don't hit the engine don't hit the
[04:46:34] unchain don't hit
[04:46:36] he hit yanching
[04:46:48] [ __ ] I don't have skill points
[04:46:51] oh damn it
[04:46:54] yeah we don't have our passive Ops I
[04:46:56] don't think we can kill if we alt but I
[04:46:57] want to try to save a turn so I'm gonna
[04:46:58] I know it doesn't matter we won't kill
[04:47:00] the others yeah it's not worth okay now
[04:47:02] we can alt though we do this
[04:47:05] Sports
[04:47:08] watch this cool
[04:47:12] naughty child nap time probably she
[04:47:17] healed but it's fine time
[04:47:21] what the [ __ ] is that Yan chinga mode
[04:47:23] it's me it's no I didn't even use my
[04:47:27] I use this little technique
[04:47:31] Ah that's fine we still got this
[04:47:33] shot
[04:47:36] um
[04:47:41] [ __ ] that was not on purpose
[04:47:48] I said heal
[04:47:50] that's better oh wait there's actually
[04:47:52] clutch I probably shouldn't all did I
[04:47:54] forgot about that
[04:47:59] that hurts I'm on guard
[04:48:06] how many can you block strike the park
[04:48:10] Sports the damage hopefully we get the
[04:48:12] full attack
[04:48:17] I don't have enough skill points to use
[04:48:19] for E here so
[04:48:23] we've entered the storm
[04:48:26] to guard and defend crush them
[04:48:30] okay lament time
[04:48:33] I probably should have broken that dude
[04:48:35] but dude
[04:48:36] this
[04:48:38] okay
[04:48:51] I wonder if using our techniques would
[04:48:53] have saved us a turn maybe not
[04:48:58] but also maybe
[04:49:09] I don't think I can kill everyone here
[04:49:13] minus one turn I guess
[04:49:21] I mean even [ __ ] die
[04:49:24] time for Sword Play
[04:49:27] strike the park you'll pay for this lend
[04:49:30] me your strength how many can you block
[04:49:33] blade
[04:49:37] it is what it is
[04:49:41] how many throws that virgin you end
[04:49:43] that should be enough honestly should be
[04:49:45] fine let's start with the trunker maybe
[04:49:49] ride your time
[04:49:56] okay so happens
[04:49:58] oh
[04:50:01] oh we're gonna implant Quantum here but
[04:50:06] it's better than normal attacking I
[04:50:07] think
[04:50:10] and then we do this
[04:50:13] and then this
[04:50:24] how many turns are they taking okay can
[04:50:27] I do this I'm happy I waited
[04:50:29] show no mercy
[04:50:31] cool
[04:50:33] they're ready [ __ ] dead and we do our
[04:50:35] Eve
[04:50:36] and then lighting lore is about a
[04:50:37] [ __ ] [ __ ] them up
[04:50:47] seems really still fun efficient I like
[04:50:48] it a lot almost too many skill points
[04:50:51] Loki but yeah
[04:50:53] I guess not because we get another turn
[04:50:55] here
[04:51:07] oh no not a taunt wow that totally
[04:51:10] changes what I was gonna do
[04:51:18] this combat me this is double speed
[04:51:24] I need to level my light cone on this
[04:51:26] guy there's no time to lose conflict I
[04:51:29] don't think I kill him here I'm lucky
[04:51:34] follow my charge
[04:51:40] a thousand thanks here there's Thunder
[04:51:44] okay he dies here
[04:51:46] I might as well wait yeah I want Bailey
[04:51:48] to heal before this thing's over might
[04:51:49] as well get free healing and then
[04:51:51] lightning load is gonna win
[04:51:53] nice okay
[04:51:58] battles are chess ah let's do this
[04:52:03] oh
[04:52:17] okay
[04:52:20] don't use that alt yet because what I'll
[04:52:22] do is this we imply a Quantum for no
[04:52:24] reason but might as well let me do this
[04:52:27] then we whip it out Conker
[04:52:30] show no mercy
[04:52:40] ah not
[04:52:43] not follow my chart here I shot an
[04:52:46] energy regener rope on silver wolf but
[04:52:47] it is what it is
[04:52:52] insufficient energy
[04:52:54] not anymore
[04:52:57] that should win in this turn
[04:53:00] or your money back guaranteed that's the
[04:53:03] zog's promise
[04:53:04] sorry
[04:53:06] okay I did I that was yeah that was
[04:53:09] terrible guy I don't win this turn is
[04:53:10] what it is actually I might I might
[04:53:12] slide myself
[04:53:17] Jun crit
[04:53:21] ER I didn't quit I'm accurate one all
[04:53:23] right whatever
[04:53:29] boom
[04:53:33] all right next one
[04:53:35] uh
[04:53:37] uh silly
[04:53:44] oh yeah listen Arjun is a little scoffed
[04:53:47] okay he's a little scuffed he needs
[04:53:49] better relics it's a work in progress
[04:53:51] just bear with me okay it's a work in
[04:53:54] progress are yatching our silly better
[04:53:55] that is what it is what is this about
[04:54:07] that I am not adding in a Mode called
[04:54:10] help me Mr lightning Lord
[04:54:14] I'm not adding this what the [ __ ] is
[04:54:17] that
[04:54:27] uh silver wolf could be good here I
[04:54:29] could do
[04:54:31] silly silver Wolfie bronya
[04:54:36] we're gonna do silly with one bronia two
[04:54:38] bronia and then a Healer
[04:54:40] and then yanching could go with
[04:54:46] like Ting Yoon
[04:54:51] Natalia and
[04:54:54] wait tingen's here what the [ __ ] Tian
[04:54:56] Natalia lament and then here we do
[04:55:03] works
[04:55:13] okay
[04:55:16] are y'all is just so silly with the wolf
[04:55:18] I mean why not just a bunch of the
[04:55:20] restaurant death Shred
[04:55:21] we could also use her with yanching but
[04:55:23] the thing with yanjing is it's harder to
[04:55:25] fit
[04:55:26] characters in the team because you want
[04:55:28] a shielder uh or a Healer or and a
[04:55:32] Healer but I don't have jip hard so I
[04:55:33] feel like fire emcee is not enough like
[04:55:36] maybe we're powered I don't need a
[04:55:37] Healer but with fire EMC I don't have
[04:55:39] depart so with fire EMC it's like I need
[04:55:41] fire EMC and a Healer
[04:55:43] unless I just don't run a shield and I
[04:55:45] say [ __ ] it if I take damage I take
[04:55:46] damage which might be the play but
[04:55:56] yeah I mean maybe we could do that
[04:55:58] honestly maybe we could just be like
[04:56:00] [ __ ] it
[04:56:06] um don't try it
[04:56:11] yeah I'm gonna try it we'll put bailu in
[04:56:13] this team then
[04:56:33] zyog's digital footprint is half simping
[04:56:36] over twink males and other half making
[04:56:38] questionable noises why did you ping me
[04:56:40] in that why did I why would you like
[04:56:43] what does that even mean that's not true
[04:56:44] first of all second of all what does
[04:56:46] that even mean
[04:56:53] who also would be good here but uh she's
[04:56:56] gonna die hey we're not dying today boom
[04:57:00] oh didn't see there hey uh Mr uh Blaze
[04:57:04] out of space what's his name oh it is
[04:57:07] out of space I'm actually dude I'm
[04:57:08] actually so smart okay let's [ __ ] him up
[04:57:10] boom kill it
[04:57:18] okay that was pretty uh progress
[04:57:23] this is gonna Implement lightning seven
[04:57:25] seven thousand dollars on the fact that
[04:57:27] we're getting lightning here wow almost
[04:57:30] as if it was guaranteed
[04:57:31] okay we do this actually
[04:57:35] yeah he does
[04:57:40] [Music]
[04:57:47] okay big damage
[04:57:50] that was good damage and we didn't even
[04:57:51] get the death strike from alt okay okay
[04:57:53] okay okay I'm a yanching enjoyer we do a
[04:57:58] let's kill a little one
[04:58:00] nice
[04:58:03] that's fine
[04:58:11] this is double speed boom
[04:58:15] then it's Yan singing Time Boom
[04:58:19] oh that's pretty good for a skill and
[04:58:21] then we should be able to win this turn
[04:58:24] I kind of want to heal
[04:58:27] don't have the skill points to heal
[04:58:30] I think of a heal I can still win so
[04:58:32] let's heal I was all be greedy with it
[04:58:36] more enemies
[04:58:41] um

[04:59:15] nice let's do it again when your level

[04:59:30] Quantum on this guy boom I'll do this
[04:59:36] kind of a waste but it's fine because
[04:59:37] now we do this then we don't alt buff
[04:59:40] and then we also
[04:59:44] I could have one shot of one of the
[04:59:46] smaller enemies but this feels better
[04:59:49] don't hit that shake don't hit the
[04:59:50] engine nice
[04:59:58] better late than never

[05:01:33] I thought it was Auto Target
[05:01:36] don't mess with me
[05:01:40] that's actually [ __ ]
[05:01:42] lend me your strength how do you miss
[05:01:45] that dude that's what I'm saying
[05:01:49] I'll enter misery
[05:01:56] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[05:01:58] that was the most silhoux gameplay of
[05:02:00] All-Star no it wasn't also I didn't crit
[05:02:02] unlucky
[05:02:06] what a headache
[05:02:11] this guy's gonna wake up but it's fine
[05:02:13] because we could get a free reset
[05:02:14] awesome don't pay for this I don't know
[05:02:17] if my basic facts are enough to kill him
[05:02:18] though because I don't I didn't really
[05:02:19] level my series basic attacks but if it
[05:02:21] is then the reset's huge
[05:02:27] okay
[05:02:35] it's time
[05:02:40] I'll free you from disappear among the
[05:02:43] scene please die illusions of the past
[05:02:46] oh dude if we could we save a turn I
[05:02:49] mean it's fine about [ __ ] 36 turns
[05:02:50] but if we crit that would have been big
[05:02:53] that's fine
[05:02:55] enemies ahead next one
[05:03:01] we're here this time
[05:03:03] thank you don't get careless The Blaze
[05:03:07] okay listen listen listen listen close
[05:03:09] and listen uh audaciously silver wolves
[05:03:13] [ __ ] relics uh sets don't really
[05:03:15] [ __ ] matter like for the toothpaste
[05:03:17] you can go the hit rate one if you need
[05:03:18] it right but like just go for like the
[05:03:19] stats you need the stats are gonna copy
[05:03:21] them until you're high investment if
[05:03:22] your high investment go the quantum set
[05:03:23] if you're not high investment it doesn't
[05:03:24] [ __ ] matter
[05:03:28] like the mask one's nice for Speed but
[05:03:36] next
[05:03:44] I'll free you from here what does hit
[05:03:46] Ray do okay hit rate is like okay
[05:03:48] imagine okay okay imagine you're like
[05:03:52] cooking right and you're like storing
[05:03:54] something okay hit raid basically
[05:03:57] increases the diameter of your whisk so
[05:04:01] let's say you're whisking a mixture and
[05:04:02] your whisk is really small and you have
[05:04:04] to like reach into the bowl because it's
[05:04:06] tiny right it's like annoying it'll
[05:04:07] still work but it's not consistent okay
[05:04:10] there might be some lumps in your
[05:04:11] spaghetti some lumps in your mixture
[05:04:13] okay but if it's like a but if the more
[05:04:15] hit rate you have the bigger the Whisk
[05:04:17] and the easier it is to whisk the
[05:04:19] mixture that is what hit rate is
[05:04:25] I'm okay it's like a like let's say you
[05:04:29] have a paddle okay and it's like why
[05:04:32] would you have a paddle I don't know but
[05:04:33] let's say you do it's like the bigger
[05:04:35] okay you're playing tennis okay and
[05:04:37] you're rocking you start with a ping
[05:04:39] pong rocket you're like why the [ __ ] are
[05:04:40] using a ping-pong racket for tennis I'm
[05:04:42] like you're trying to serve and like you
[05:04:44] can kind of surf but it's not an
[05:04:46] efficient surf but then the more hitter
[05:04:47] you have the more your racket gets
[05:04:49] bigger and eventually you have a tennis
[05:04:51] racket and that's what happens when your
[05:04:53] silver wolf has enough hit rates which
[05:04:55] is 96.1
[05:04:57] roughly
[05:04:59] your misery
[05:05:05] lend me your strength don't mess with me
[05:05:11] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[05:05:13] illusions of the past
[05:05:16] yes sorry sorry
[05:05:20] cool
[05:05:24] uh all right four
[05:05:27] this one's kind of annoying but we could
[05:05:29] uh
[05:05:31] uh implement the weakness onto japardo
[05:05:36] I don't think we played that hung here
[05:05:38] though because I think my celias is
[05:05:40] better
[05:05:42] Zila
[05:05:45] what's going on guys today we're [ __ ]
[05:05:48] playing zela
[05:05:51] yeah I think it used to think uh here
[05:05:53] maybe against your part and just ignore
[05:05:55] the weakness and just [ __ ] brute
[05:05:56] force him
[05:05:58] uh and then here we could no I don't
[05:06:00] like that idea actually
[05:06:10] I think we brewed Force first half with
[05:06:13] Celie and then second half
[05:06:24] yeah I guess wealth we could just welt
[05:06:27] them but
[05:06:31] we get Seely wealth actually
[05:06:37] you do a better odd awesome what's going
[05:06:39] on guys Asian guy here back guy again
[05:06:43] I do I know I do I know I do no big deal
[05:06:46] I know I do
[05:06:49] we could do silly
[05:06:53] we could do silly welt and then first
[05:06:55] half we do
[05:06:58] sorry uh first off we do yanching
[05:07:02] implement the ice no but no no let's ask
[05:07:04] that's actually that's actually copium I
[05:07:06] don't know what I'm saying we could do
[05:07:07] this and then second half we do
[05:07:11] like this
[05:07:15] dice of cringe and then here we
[05:08:18] am I cooking or no what do you think
[05:08:20] about this team what are we thinking
[05:08:21] what are we thinking what are we
[05:08:22] thinking so here I just Unga Bunga Brute
[05:08:25] Force [ __ ] weaknesses right second half
[05:08:27] I ice weakness this [ __ ] and then I
[05:08:30] Implement ice onto Japan's anus and then
[05:08:32] we we win both
[05:08:42] Is wealth not good no wealth is good
[05:08:44] wealth is good wealth is definitely good
[05:08:46] I just can't really fit him in my teams
[05:08:47] and also he's level 60 like he's under
[05:08:49] geared compared to my other characters
[05:08:50] he's definitely good he's definitely
[05:08:51] good it's just another thing with
[05:08:53] debuffers and why I think so I think
[05:08:56] silver wolf has a lot of really good
[05:08:57] things going for her I think she's a
[05:08:59] good unit but another thing is like a
[05:09:01] lot of people are like oh my God she's
[05:09:02] so good you need her but it's also like
[05:09:03] bro you have Pila you have wealth you
[05:09:05] probably have Ting you and you probably
[05:09:06] have you might have bronia you might
[05:09:08] have like there's so many assets like
[05:09:09] there's so many characters that are good
[05:09:11] that you can use that's like kind of
[05:09:12] hard to fit all these characters
[05:09:15] and it's like if you have a wealth and
[05:09:17] pillow it's like are you gonna use
[05:09:18] wealth and Pila and silver wolf probably
[05:09:20] not like I can't really fit all three
[05:09:24] but a lot of people don't have wealth so
[05:09:33] foreign
[05:09:54] we're in trouble now
[05:10:06] a thousand wonders
[05:10:19] oh yeah Jafar does have ice resistance
[05:10:21] oh we might be griefing with these teams
[05:10:23] I actually didn't think about that
[05:10:26] uh it's actually unlucky
[05:10:33] this battle is unavoidable
[05:10:36] lend me your strength
[05:10:38] what a headache
[05:10:40] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[05:10:42] dude shut the [ __ ] up she is not the
[05:10:45] causeway of this game shut the [ __ ] up
[05:10:47] stop
[05:10:49] it
[05:10:51] shut the [ __ ] up everyone who says that
[05:10:55] stop
[05:11:04] [Music]
[05:11:05] better late than never
[05:11:08] yeah
[05:11:11] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[05:11:13] illusions of the past
[05:11:24] crush them let's be friends
[05:11:32] what a headache who's next
[05:11:37] lend me your strength
[05:11:39] don't mess with me
[05:11:49] assistance is Timely
[05:11:53] talk
[05:12:00] okay I have a question though like
[05:12:01] genuine question
[05:12:03] genuine question like I actually did any
[05:12:05] questions does anyone know what the
[05:12:06] point of a mono team is like I know
[05:12:08] everyone's like talking about like
[05:12:09] playing them but like does anyone
[05:12:11] actually play them like why like I like
[05:12:13] what is the purpose what a headache like
[05:12:15] what's the benefit like the thing you
[05:12:18] like to own that Buffs other [ __ ]
[05:12:19] lightning characters it's like what is
[05:12:21] the like what's the benefit
[05:12:26] a sharp Scythe needs targets
[05:12:37] brute force with Sealy you can move for
[05:12:39] us with silly anyways you don't need to
[05:12:41] be mono to brute first to silly in fact
[05:12:43] I'd argue that it might be more
[05:12:45] efficient to just go Ting you and brania
[05:12:46] or silver wolf and then just a good
[05:12:48] support instead of [ __ ] Ching Choi or
[05:12:50] whatever
[05:12:53] but you'd probably do like well like
[05:12:54] you'd probably go based on their
[05:12:55] weaknesses you'd probably do double
[05:12:56] Quantum and then whatever the [ __ ] their
[05:12:58] weaknesses are
[05:13:00] which isn't mono like I get why you'd
[05:13:02] call it mono it's not mono
[05:13:14] a thousand wonders to race
[05:13:26] oh
[05:13:28] this should kill right
[05:13:34] this battle is unavoidable lend me your
[05:13:37] strength
[05:13:38] don't mess with me
[05:13:41] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[05:13:43] illusions of the past

[05:14:45] healing welcome customers

[05:15:19] better late than never
[05:15:22] the point of monologue can Brute Force
[05:15:25] the silly Brown because they're a whale
[05:15:26] okay but name me a moto team that's not
[05:15:28] a whale team it's all based around a
[05:15:29] five-star character
[05:15:32] like most people like Moto Quantum is
[05:15:34] good but Moto Quantum is basically just
[05:15:36] the same thing
[05:15:37] [Music]
[05:15:43] better late than never
[05:15:46] I'll free you from disappear among the
[05:15:48] Sea of butterflies illusions of the past
[05:15:58] ten Yoon highest aggro dude do you think
[05:16:01] it's yeah I think it just always dies
[05:16:13] she's more of a nilu no she's not no
[05:16:15] she's not
[05:16:16] no she's not she's not at all you can
[05:16:19] play her in literally any team shift the
[05:16:22] balance
[05:16:28] like I can't lie
[05:16:34] yeah you can play in literally any team
[05:16:54] not a scratch
[05:17:02] more enemies
[05:17:09] The Forbidden 16 19. one time
[05:17:17] for Sword Play
[05:17:22] strike with parts
[05:17:25] descent
[05:17:29] foreign
[05:17:34] hits hard you can't say not gonna lie
[05:17:37] and then proceed to immediately lie
[05:17:51] not gonna lie and then the biggest lie
[05:17:53] I've ever heard
[05:17:56] how many can you block
[05:17:59] Ed
[05:18:02] actually I don't know why I'm bothering
[05:18:03] killing these guys I should probably
[05:18:04] just focus on this guy
[05:18:19] how many can you block blade oh [ __ ] I
[05:18:22] might need oh I might need another turn
[05:18:24] no I still need another turn
[05:18:29] [ __ ] uh minus one turn that's unlucky
[05:18:36] ready when you are
[05:18:39] okay we do
[05:18:42] this
[05:18:52] okay let's give him ice weakness please
[05:18:56] how many can you block
[05:19:02] this combat needs optimize this is
[05:19:05] double speed
[05:19:08] I feel nothing but pain fine we don't
[05:19:10] need it
[05:19:21] dispute
[05:19:27] nap time
[05:19:37] oh fish are taunted but it'll be fine
[05:19:41] yeah
[05:19:43] do this
[05:19:47] okay
[05:19:48] um well
[05:19:50] well well well
[05:19:52] sorry
[05:20:07] that's what all doctors I should have
[05:20:09] done this before attacking that's fine
[05:20:12] good it's new okay then we do hit
[05:20:18] let me do this
[05:20:22] okay
[05:20:29] practice is over Sports descent well
[05:20:31] they should have waited before all thing
[05:20:32] now that I think about it but 20K
[05:20:35] probably gonna go to more Buffs though
[05:20:36] is the problem but it's fine
[05:20:47] just double speed
[05:20:49] okay nice nice nice nice winnable
[05:20:59] [ __ ] one percent are you kidding
[05:21:02] all right
[05:21:05] dude just die you're one percent
[05:21:10] summons the hard enough to kill them
[05:21:13] okay thank god oh I have to kill him
[05:21:17] minus one turn
[05:21:23] it's time
[05:21:24] I just did it
[05:21:29] easy
[05:21:34] wait Chad I have a question
[05:21:38] ah wait one sec
[05:21:49] three characters that are ice resistant
[05:21:54] do we know if there's less of a chance
[05:21:56] to apply the ice weakness from silver
[05:21:58] wolf or does it not matter
[05:22:00] because I haven't had time to test that
[05:22:01] obviously because she just came out
[05:22:09] or is it still the same
[05:22:12] I don't think it matters
[05:22:19] shouldn't matter okay I felt like it
[05:22:22] shouldn't but yeah
[05:22:25] I don't know
[05:22:40] is nahida good with Jin you and probably
[05:22:42] really good for aggravate
[05:22:53] [Music]
[05:22:54] um wait what the [ __ ] why is this why
[05:22:57] are we fighting that enemy again right
[05:22:59] instantly
[05:23:03] I'm not so lucky
[05:23:05] [ __ ] wind weakness into wind weakness
[05:23:07] again if I was a dead hunk player I mean
[05:23:09] I am but
[05:23:10] you know this is silly never mind
[05:23:12] oh yeah we're just too [ __ ] wait what
[05:23:14] was I looking at
[05:23:15] okay this is easy we're just too silly
[05:23:17] it's fun I was like I was like at the
[05:23:19] other [ __ ] floor I got this one I was
[05:23:21] like why are we doing this again
[05:23:32] all right
[05:23:37] that's what our team's gonna look like
[05:23:39] probably uh we want to implement ice
[05:23:43] so we could just do if we do Natasha
[05:23:47] then there's a chance we don't get ice
[05:23:48] so we might want to do bailu lament but
[05:23:51] then this team's only healer is going to
[05:23:52] be Natalya which isn't
[05:23:56] I don't know I might die because she's
[05:23:57] not that well geared but
[05:24:28] yeah we can also genuine second half but
[05:24:31] I feel like my answering does way more
[05:24:32] damage
[05:24:34] foreign
[05:24:35] oh
[05:25:03] oh this guy's ice resistant
[05:25:11] yeah maybe we don't play engine here
[05:25:15] Sage I wanted to play engine
[05:25:36] all right we send this
[05:25:40] enemies
[05:25:48] okay
[05:25:50] uh this is an annoying amount of enemies
[05:25:53] but that should be fine
[05:25:56] it's fine that's fine that's fine yeah
[05:26:00] sure just yeah sure yeah just [ __ ]
[05:26:02] instantly kill my bronyo why don't you
[05:26:04] yup cool
[05:26:05] okay uh
[05:26:08] well let me do this
[05:26:15] I'm sure this kills right okay it
[05:26:17] doesn't
[05:26:26] it's fine I can do this
[05:26:38] we've entered the storm
[05:26:40] to guard and defend crush them what a
[05:26:44] headache this combat needs optimizing I
[05:26:46] feel like it's worth going all out here
[05:26:47] because of the huge damage bomb we're
[05:26:49] gonna take a [ __ ] of damage we might
[05:26:50] die if we die it wasn't worth if we
[05:26:52] don't die it was worth so we'll see
[05:26:58] I actually killed the other dude but
[05:26:59] it's fine
[05:27:09] there's always a weakness
[05:27:27] what a headache what a headache I
[05:27:30] probably should have said the reset
[05:27:31] actually that's why I know
[05:27:33] this
[05:27:34] let me do this
[05:27:37] [ __ ] almost dead
[05:27:43] oh
[05:27:44] dude
[05:27:48] I'll enter misery who's going next this
[05:27:51] guy kill him
[05:27:53] nice is that
[05:27:55] okay I want to make sure I can heal here
[05:27:57] so we do this
[05:27:58] then we have a [ __ ] heal brought it
[05:28:01] up
[05:28:02] since it's Timely
[05:28:05] try alts
[05:28:09] I got alt heal everyone to fall
[05:28:13] then I brought it e so by looking at
[05:28:15] some energy
[05:28:23] drink
[05:28:24] okay
[05:28:27] [ __ ] I'm gonna have to waste it ah
[05:28:28] whatever disappear I don't want to waste
[05:28:30] the turn
[05:28:37] a sharp Scythe needs targets
[05:28:39] show your courage oh
[05:28:48] that's actually really nice
[05:29:01] I'm by the low key is gonna need to
[05:29:03] [ __ ] use uh her all soon
[05:29:12] might as well so I can heal here
[05:29:17] Badness
[05:29:20] fine

[05:29:34] surely we just one shot him okay we
[05:29:36] don't all good
[05:29:41] you don't pay for this
[05:29:50] conversation is like very scuffed I
[05:29:52] think I'm just gonna reset it
[05:29:58] nice that production well that was
[05:30:00] attack but there's both
[05:30:04] that from our light cone I think
[05:30:12] hey I think we this should one shot or
[05:30:15] your money back guaranteed yep
[05:30:18] let me do this with the damage

[05:30:37] lengthening your strength oh I'm so
[05:30:39] smart and then basically that kills and
[05:30:41] then we reset and then this guy's dead

[05:31:36] there's no time to lose
[05:31:37] there's no time to lose all right
[05:31:40] oh wait maybe I should have waited for
[05:31:41] him to summon a bunch of dudes before
[05:31:42] all things
[05:31:43] fine uh lighting glow is gonna like
[05:31:46] [ __ ]

[05:32:21] conflict
[05:32:25] show no mercy
[05:32:32] okay we're gonna adjust the time for our
[05:32:34] lighting load
[05:32:39] follow my charge
[05:32:45] I griefed
[05:32:48] I agree with my skill points
[05:32:50] oh no I think he's gonna die oh [ __ ]
[05:32:54] I've seen this happen before uh
[05:33:00] I'm gonna use my skill here and then I'm
[05:33:03] gonna alt just a little something
[05:33:15] please don't kill Ting Yoon please don't
[05:33:18] kill Yoon please don't kill okay cool
[05:33:22] there's no time to lose okay I low-key
[05:33:25] want to save some skill points here
[05:33:27] low-key though
[05:33:34] I break this right oh no I don't
[05:33:39] I do okay cool uh I wanna heal but I
[05:33:43] also want to buff
[05:33:45] I feel like if I heal I lose but if I
[05:33:47] don't heal I lose
[05:33:49] okay if I heal I might not have enough
[05:33:52] turns to win
[05:33:53] wait I do I stopped 32 left wait but
[05:33:55] you're supposed to attack yesterday
[05:34:02] surely Thinkin doesn't die right surely
[05:34:05] dude what are the odds he hits thing
[05:34:06] Yoon I have four characters there's only
[05:34:09] one that could die
[05:34:11] there's only one that could die if I'm
[05:34:13] off
[05:34:15] dude surely it doesn't hit the unit
[05:34:18] surely not
[05:34:24] that's better better late than never
[05:34:27] let's see if it would have hit her
[05:34:33] oh it's everyone but I wouldn't have
[05:34:34] killed already so maybe we didn't have
[05:34:36] to do that
[05:34:40] kind of want to taunt your Loki but on
[05:34:42] the lowest of keys only
[05:34:44] actually yeah but who's next Ting you no
[05:34:47] I need a skill point I need a [ __ ]
[05:34:48] skill point I'm not daunting
[05:34:50] nice okay okay nice basically as if I
[05:34:53] taunted
[05:34:59] [Music]
[05:35:01] okay
[05:35:04] there's no time to lose
[05:35:10] this floor is pretty bad for like
[05:35:12] obviously that enemies have lightning
[05:35:13] weakness so it's good for Virginia but a
[05:35:16] lot of like the way it works is it'll
[05:35:17] buff you at the start of the turn but it
[05:35:19] doesn't buff your lighting lower it's
[05:35:20] just like kind of wasted on
[05:35:23] it is partially why I wanted to play
[05:35:24] yaching
[05:35:26] fully
[05:35:37] welcome customers
[05:35:43] show no mercy
[05:35:49] well
[05:35:52] okay you know what
[05:35:55] it's fine we can it's fine uh it's okay
[05:35:58] it's okay it's fine that's not our fault
[05:36:01] it happens our characters are under
[05:36:02] leveled it's okay okay we're fighting
[05:36:04] level 80 enemies with a level 60 Ting
[05:36:06] Yoon it is only natural that mistakes
[05:36:09] may happen it's normal it's okay it's
[05:36:12] fine our first half went really well our
[05:36:14] Sealy our silver wolf they popped off
[05:36:16] second off it is what it is uh we might
[05:36:20] need
[05:36:22] some small changes
[05:36:32] he's attack something you would already
[05:36:34] kind of do I already have [ __ ] no I
[05:36:36] don't actually never mind I don't I
[05:36:38] thought I did I only I have a text out
[05:36:40] on bronya nantinian I'll level her
[05:36:43] I just I'm like broke like I can only
[05:36:45] get 64.
[05:36:48] but
[05:36:50] we could also
[05:36:51] um
[05:36:56] could have played bailu in that team
[05:36:59] do you want to enter the forgot
[05:37:02] I could have done like
[05:37:11] could do this
[05:37:17] and then
[05:37:18] Natasha first half
[05:37:27] those might be better
[05:37:32] and then if I want to go even more have
[05:37:34] I could say [ __ ] you Natalia and then
[05:37:36] give the good lycon
[05:38:00] are you the level uh is likely to 80
[05:38:03] though the cycle is only 70 which is
[05:38:05] kind of griefing me but it's fine
[05:38:18] yeah
[05:38:20] foreign
[05:38:30] this guy
[05:38:31] show your current
[05:38:40] trickier to craft
[05:38:44] no child okay it's fine just please
[05:38:48] don't kill her
[05:38:59] how much damage I do I'm curious
[05:39:02] okay that was a lot I might not need to
[05:39:04] alt yeah ultimate dude [ __ ] it I want to
[05:39:07] all to kill one of the small ones but I
[05:39:08] think we're fine
[05:39:09] are we in crit I'm lucky
[05:39:16] it's fine
[05:39:18] oh this guy lives to my HP
[05:39:21] do we do this and then we do this
[05:39:30] is Timely
[05:39:31] so you are afraid of me
[05:39:34] who's next I'll enter misery okay good
[05:39:39] damage boost and we do I probably should
[05:39:41] say the skill point but
[05:39:43] it's fine this
[05:39:45] we've entered the storm to guard and
[05:39:49] defend crush them more enemies
[05:39:59] yeah that's fine as long as I don't take
[05:40:02] too much damage is fine
[05:40:09] lend me your strength what a headache
[05:40:17] I'll freeze I wasted my boss
[05:40:20] oh I kind of grief that turns at the
[05:40:22] past
[05:40:23] wait never mind
[05:40:29] wait let me cook
[05:40:34] all right cool last one
[05:40:37] this
[05:40:41] I like
[05:40:42] um silver wolves technique it seems
[05:40:44] pretty nice this one has a lot of
[05:40:45] enemies
[05:40:46] a crack
[05:40:58] that's better thanks one sec pressing
[05:41:01] down
[05:41:07] okay oh
[05:41:10] probably do this

[05:41:52] fine
[05:41:55] all right it's fine running back
[05:42:00] dude what could I have done all right we
[05:42:03] started this one starting with this
[05:42:04] one's actually better
[05:42:12] trickier to crack
[05:42:18] those who use skills shall be punished
[05:42:21] bro I can't even heal
[05:42:23] by healing got punished
[05:42:27] I'm not getting punished
[05:42:33] I'm about to take so much [ __ ] damage
[05:42:37] I cannot use my skill
[05:42:42] decisive moment in the battle
[05:42:44] lend me
[05:42:47] lend me oh that was not worth it I
[05:42:49] thought I would think less than that
[05:42:53] okay that was not worth it
[05:42:58] yeah okay let me change this thing
[05:43:08] where's Natalia
[05:43:12] foreign
[05:43:16] but
[05:43:24] maybe we should
[05:43:29] also we could I mean I guess we don't
[05:43:30] need speed boots to be honest
[05:43:38] because we're all Speedos right now but
[05:43:40] we can just say HP
[05:43:59] but then Fleet of the ages doesn't even
[05:44:01] work you don't have speed
[05:44:03] but it's fine for now I guess
[05:44:17] okay
[05:44:20] ready when you are
[05:44:22] foreign
[05:44:50] lend me your strength
[05:44:55] time
[05:45:04] lend me your strength you're on the four
[05:45:07] piece which one the Healer set healers
[05:45:08] that four piece is so [ __ ] bad
[05:45:10] I dude I don't care man the Healer said
[05:45:13] four piece is one buff at the start of
[05:45:16] the fight one skill point wow I'm so
[05:45:19] glad this is gonna help me six turns in
[05:45:22] the past
[05:45:23] lend me your strength
[05:45:27] to Garden defense crush them
[05:45:33] yeah yeah
[05:45:50] this is double speed
[05:45:54] lend me your strength who's next
[05:45:57] well let's go we're gonna decide zero or
[05:46:00] one turn okay but
[05:46:01] I mean
[05:46:03] no like yes there's situations where
[05:46:07] okay you can get an extra Star by saving
[05:46:09] a turn but usually if like you're
[05:46:12] clearing in so such a short amount of
[05:46:14] time
[05:46:16] that the skill point matters a lot then
[05:46:18] you're probably three starring anyways
[05:46:19] unless your other team sucks balls if
[05:46:21] your other team sucks balls then yeah
[05:46:22] this sounds good
[05:46:24] but if both of your teams are like if
[05:46:25] both their teams are bad and the set's
[05:46:27] bad and if both of their teams are good

[05:48:30] think people

[05:48:35] she's just a better pillow
[05:48:37] I don't think she's like the like
[05:48:40] I feel like her weakness implementation
[05:48:42] is not even the main part of her kit
[05:48:43] like it's like a unique part but I don't
[05:48:45] think it's even the main thing like dude
[05:48:46] who the [ __ ] cares like for some teams
[05:48:49] it's like okay like cool but like for
[05:48:51] most of the time it's just like death

[05:50:49] okay we did enough right we just needed
[05:50:51] three
[05:50:53] where's Natasha
[05:50:55] Natasha I don't have any XP though so
[05:50:57] even if I Ascend her what is the point
[05:51:01] what actually why did I even do this I
[05:51:03] don't have XP to level her and honestly
[05:51:06] I might as well level her [ __ ] weapon
[05:51:07] because the weapon has HP on it
[05:51:10] I gained more I gained more [ __ ] I
[05:51:13] gain more HP by doing this
[05:51:23] wait there's only 60.
[05:51:29] now worth
[05:51:33] how much HP do you have now
[05:51:35] okay we had less than 3K we now have 4
[05:51:38] 600. granted we removed our speed boots
[05:51:40] which I kind of regret we might go back
[05:51:42] to speed but okay we actually have a lot
[05:51:45] of HP like we're not a lot but like it's
[05:51:47] like okay like it's okay
[05:51:51] it's okay shut up

[05:52:29] anyways if you want to get a fleet of
[05:52:30] the Ageless buff we have to go speed
[05:52:32] boots
[05:52:47] um I need to make sure I don't die on
[05:52:48] other characters though
[05:53:00] um but I think it'll be fine
[05:53:08] foreign
[05:53:26] that's why this was for brania I know
[05:53:30] how Bilo ended up with them
[05:53:32] uh I just don't think I have another HP
[05:53:34] one
[05:53:35] that's level the way I do but this is
[05:53:37] inertail Soto

[06:01:10] bigger than I thought okay
[06:01:12] damn that was like simulated Universe
[06:01:14] damage the [ __ ]
[06:01:17] not down
[06:01:20] what the hell
[06:01:24] that was really good
[06:01:27] I'm Gonna Save that clip right now
[06:01:33] life is as ephemeral as two on a leaf
[06:01:36] and full of what they strife
[06:01:48] all right
[06:01:50] uh this guy was annoying as [ __ ] so I I
[06:01:53] should start with him but I don't want
[06:01:55] to we'll do this one not to crack that's
[06:02:00] a tough nut to crack
[06:02:03] I
[06:02:05] was the draw for Hawkeye Starr rail
[06:02:07] about to help
[06:02:10] okay this guy wait why is my team still
[06:02:13] on life support I actually forgot how
[06:02:15] low HP she was maybe I should level her
[06:02:19] all right well
[06:02:21] it's over it's Joe over chat it's
[06:02:23] [ __ ] drover
[06:02:34] it's fine I might just have to use more
[06:02:35] skill points to heal and [ __ ] even if
[06:02:37] you get like two stars instead of three
[06:02:38] it's all good so I should heal here
[06:02:43] and then this
[06:02:47] is
[06:02:49] that's unfortunate I didn't break the
[06:02:51] shield
[06:02:58] nevermind doesn't matter
[06:03:03] I'm gonna alt here I might maybe I
[06:03:06] should save all of the ads but we have
[06:03:08] the damage buff okay never did no damage
[06:03:09] okay I wish to save it
[06:03:14] lightning Lord waiting room
[06:03:17] okay uh let's buff him again
[06:03:21] puzzle skill
[06:03:25] s
[06:03:34] that I basically got here
[06:03:37] then I attack here get all our [ __ ]
[06:03:39] skill points
[06:03:41] I kind of want a taunt but I don't think
[06:03:43] it's
[06:03:44] smart too so we're just gonna do that
[06:03:46] yeah
[06:03:48] okay
[06:03:51] what the [ __ ] uh
[06:03:54] so much
[06:03:57] there's no time to lose
[06:04:00] conflict
[06:04:06] a thousand wonders
[06:04:11] follow my charge
[06:04:15] show no mercy
[06:04:19] we're currently doing Peanut amounts of
[06:04:22] damage but it's fine their first half
[06:04:25] was really good
[06:04:27] [Music]
[06:04:33] it's not really our fault like our
[06:04:35] build's fine it's just
[06:04:38] a big coping right now
[06:04:42] we also have to run two defensive uh
[06:04:45] supports which is not the best
[06:04:53] here there's Thunder
[06:05:03] like that welcome customers
[06:05:11] oh I pressed e
[06:05:17] when faced with an army buy your time
[06:05:21] and time your attack
[06:05:25] oh look at this
[06:05:33] okay
[06:05:36] there's no time to lose
[06:05:42] this first
[06:05:45] just to break the shields
[06:05:55] trifling
[06:06:12] Lancer Blaze
[06:06:14] oh cage
[06:06:16] oh cage
[06:06:21] oh I sure waited for the start of the
[06:06:23] turn to alts because to get another buff
[06:06:24] or whatever
[06:06:26] and a foregone conclusion
[06:06:31] I slowly but surely the Lightning God
[06:06:34] will carry us
[06:06:44] welcome customers
[06:06:48] there's nothing even anyone but the
[06:06:51] Union
[06:06:53] [Music]
[06:06:54] uh we should probably heal
[06:06:57] but Balu has res so even if they can die
[06:06:59] is technically fine
[06:07:03] I'm gonna wait because if I rest okay
[06:07:05] well she's dead
[06:07:07] okay well
[06:07:09] [Music]
[06:07:14] good friend okay
[06:07:17] um
[06:07:17] okay so we definitely
[06:07:20] need to taunt but I can't
[06:07:29] I'm gonna buy the wall
[06:07:34] a thousand thanks
[06:07:46] genuine doesn't have a lot of stocks on
[06:07:47] the lighting load right now but I could
[06:07:49] get I if I have enough energy regen I
[06:07:51] could get enough I don't think I have
[06:07:52] enough like if I use skill here and they
[06:07:54] get my burst I could get enough I don't
[06:07:55] think I have oh I do okay so we can do
[06:07:58] this get more socks before it's the
[06:08:00] lightning lower turn
[06:08:02] so this is good show no mercy I forgot
[06:08:05] to level my energy regen rope so I'm
[06:08:06] actually like getting my [ __ ] okay that
[06:08:09] was really clutch okay that was good
[06:08:12] okay nice
[06:08:13] our damage is still copium but it is
[06:08:15] what it is
[06:08:16] it is what it is a little bit of Envy
[06:08:19] POV that's fine
[06:08:28] oh it's fine
[06:08:36] [Music]
[06:08:45] oh that's unfortunate
[06:08:48] yeah we [ __ ] up there
[06:08:51] well I don't think there's much we could
[06:08:53] have done but I felt like we [ __ ] up
[06:08:56] should be able to kill him here though
[06:09:01] this
[06:09:03] is
[06:09:12] okay we need to you and ultimate before
[06:09:15] lighting Lord goes and then we should be
[06:09:16] able to kill
[06:09:17] so I don't know I don't think we got
[06:09:20] thing insults here though but maybe I'm
[06:09:22] lucky
[06:09:24] [ __ ] that didn't kill now
[06:09:27] there's no time origin gun is kind of
[06:09:29] not doing anything
[06:09:30] maybe we should just play yanching
[06:09:33] because I think we're one turn short now
[06:09:35] unless we get hit actually no it yeah
[06:09:39] follow my charge
[06:09:42] angle
[06:09:52] I have to keep
[06:09:57] yeah now we can run it back wait why is
[06:10:00] everyone dying now what the [ __ ] bro
[06:10:02] he's one HP just died
[06:10:04] our own characters
[06:10:13] yeah let me redo that one I mean we
[06:10:15] cleared it so cool but I think I can do
[06:10:18] that better
[06:10:19] I don't know watching actually nothing
[06:10:23] but I think we're on the wrong uh wrong
[06:10:25] set anyways
[06:10:27] well I know we don't have a good
[06:10:28] lighting set but I don't think it would
[06:10:30] matter that much
[06:10:33] wait what the [ __ ] what if I bronya
[06:10:37] I feel like I got here but I forgot
[06:10:48] the [ __ ] with the right bronya
[06:10:54] this looks a lot uh more doable though
[06:10:59] like we might not be able to beat it
[06:11:01] with our character levels right now
[06:11:02] because only like you know they're not
[06:11:03] like as high as they could be but
[06:11:08] looks better for our teams because we
[06:11:09] could do something like uh
[06:11:13] probably this
[06:11:36] hmm
[06:11:39] okay we're gonna do the Forbidden
[06:11:41] strategy
[06:11:44] we're into the Forbidden strategy
[06:11:48] where did the Forbidden strategy of run
[06:11:50] up to branya up for a scrap
[06:11:55] show your current oh this is a forbidden
[06:11:58] strategy
[06:12:03] you took the baby oh wait nevermind
[06:12:05] there's waves
[06:12:06] okay
[06:12:09] I don't know what the proven strategy is
[06:12:10] anymore
[06:12:15] no longer applies here
[06:12:23] I altered nor the [ __ ] to my old my old
[06:12:25] go
[06:12:28] illusions of the past
[06:12:39] maybe wrong boat on this house
[06:12:50] I'll enter misery
[06:12:54] naughty child
[06:12:59] this battle is unable lend me your
[06:13:02] strength okay should we also kill both
[06:13:04] here
[06:13:08] fine we've entered the storms to guard
[06:13:12] and defend crush them this combat need
[06:13:15] this is double speed
[06:13:18] okay don't mess with me uh uh all free
[06:13:23] from your disappear among the Sea of
[06:13:24] butterflies illusions of the past oh
[06:13:27] that's pretty good damage can I have fun
[06:13:30] this time
[06:13:31] cool I know if it's enough because I
[06:13:34] feel like yeah we might not have enough
[06:13:35] feelings I might need to go buy them on
[06:13:37] this half and then
[06:13:43] probably Overkill
[06:13:45] lend me your strength don't mess with me
[06:13:50] who's next
[06:13:57] long is that someone reinforcements
[06:14:11] okay that was [ __ ] stupid I don't
[06:14:12] know I attacked that guy
[06:14:14] thank you what a headache
[06:14:18] stay close
[06:14:29] they're surely he dies here right
[06:14:32] I'll enter misery
[06:14:39] disappear among the Sea of butterflies
[06:14:42] illusions of the past
[06:14:45] that's better
[06:14:50] just a little something think nothing
[06:14:52] okay break the shield here
[06:14:57] silly
[06:15:05] they're being silly go but it kind of
[06:15:07] does nothing
[06:15:08] I mean your strength
[06:15:12] who's next
[06:15:16] our turns are so [ __ ]
[06:15:21] but also not what I wanted
[06:15:39] come on
[06:15:41] okay I think we fall off here we're just
[06:15:44] gonna use everything [ __ ] it
[06:15:46] it's fine if he counters on me as long
[06:15:48] as they don't die actually it's
[06:15:50] optimizing
[06:15:51] probably shouldn't do that
[06:15:55] also our defense is down for some
[06:15:57] [ __ ] why do we have minus 50 defense
[06:15:59] okay I can't do that never mind yeah I
[06:16:02] don't know we had minus [ __ ] 50
[06:16:04] defense why the [ __ ] is our defense down
[06:16:06] so much
[06:16:14] fun yeah we would have died if we uh got
[06:16:18] counted on her
[06:16:20] I should say my alts
[06:16:29] well I'll be too weak for this
[06:16:33] was our characters are [ __ ] low HP
[06:16:34] already
[06:16:36] wait what's this
[06:16:38] no weakness
[06:16:41] oh yeah I should probably kill these
[06:16:44] guys then
[06:16:53] oh yeah okay we might need a little bit
[06:16:56] more healing
[06:17:00] um well we might have to sacrifice her I
[06:17:02] heal silly
[06:17:04] thanks yeah that's fine you kind of have
[06:17:06] to choose
[06:17:10] bye Lou first half maybe
[06:17:13] play
[06:17:18] all right well
[06:17:20] um you know it's been fun
[06:17:22] it was like it was cool the fun thought
[06:17:25] experiment
[06:17:26] but we clearly need a little bit more HP
[06:17:30] or Balu
[06:17:31] uh but we can do this later for sure
[06:17:41] yeah let me try later
[06:17:43] I have to I just need more like dude
[06:17:45] it's so [ __ ] hard to get all these
[06:17:46] characters
[06:17:48] so much stamina
[06:17:52] so much stamina
[06:18:32] uh yeah I'll probably make my characters
[06:18:34] tankier because they're kind of dying to
[06:18:36] random [ __ ] like our damage is good
[06:18:38] enough but we're dying to random [ __ ]
[06:18:40] I'll probably figure that I'll probably
[06:18:41] invest in a uh Natasha later because our
[06:18:44] traces are [ __ ] terrible on her but I
[06:18:46] usually just use bailou
[06:18:56] but yeah
[06:19:03] yeah
[06:19:06] why
[06:19:10] now his face
[06:19:18] oh yeah I should probably
[06:19:20] uh go figure out some silver [ __ ] I
[06:19:24] should probably badge I'm [ __ ] tired
[06:19:25] but um
[06:19:27] yeah slowest is pretty nice uh it's just
[06:19:30] pretty good I have to figure out like
[06:19:31] how good but she definitely seems like a
[06:19:33] pretty decent character so
[06:19:39] uh only things I have left to figure out
[06:19:41] are like certain parts of her kit like
[06:19:43] weird interactions
[06:19:45] did you eat another extreme but before I
[06:19:48] did
[06:19:49] um
[06:19:50] like I I all the builds and stuff I know
[06:19:53] the only thing is like some of our teams
[06:19:55] I find weird like I feel like you can
[06:19:57] manipulate
[06:19:59] I think you can vary your team based on
[06:20:01] what you're fighting to ensure that
[06:20:02] you're always getting the weakness thing
[06:20:03] you want
[06:20:07] um but I don't know about team comps
[06:20:09] with her that you can use all the time
[06:20:11] like I feel like you kind of want to
[06:20:12] flex a little bit like I feel like if
[06:20:14] you're running like
[06:20:18] Sealy silver wolf and like
[06:20:20] a flex slot the flex slot is like very
[06:20:22] important to actually be Flex I feel
[06:20:24] like you don't run the same formula over
[06:20:26] and over unless you're playing like some
[06:20:27] weird mono [ __ ] but yeah
[06:20:37] yeah it should also get better in the
[06:20:39] future
[06:20:40] uh with more characters
[06:20:43] but I do think you have to be flexible
[06:20:45] with her team comp
[06:20:48] um
[06:20:50] yeah I like her a lot though I like her
[06:20:52] I think she's Irreplaceable but I think
[06:20:54] she's good which is important so
[06:20:58] uh yeah I think there's more ways to
[06:21:01] build her now that you don't actually
[06:21:02] need as much hit rate as you otherwise
[06:21:04] would have or shouldn't get uh buffed
[06:21:06] like the hit rate stuff got buffed or
[06:21:07] effect res so I think you can actually
[06:21:09] go like there's actually a case we made
[06:21:11] for a crit rate body and then hit rate
[06:21:12] substance or not going Pan Galactic
[06:21:15] commercial Enterprise or
[06:21:18] like changing your light cone so that's
[06:21:20] actually pretty cool now different ways
[06:21:22] to filter uh but I'll finish the guide
[06:21:24] tomorrow
[06:21:30] also do we know
[06:21:33] nearly 170 hit right now no you need 96.
[06:21:36] it's not 170 it's 96. it used to be 130
[06:21:38] what the [ __ ] is 170 bro it used to be
[06:21:40] 130 uh five
[06:21:42] now it's 96.
[06:21:59] 170 it's still more than 70 though
[06:22:05] but it depends where you're at in the
[06:22:07] game
[06:22:08] 96 is for the highest level it's like to
[06:22:10] be consistent even against level 90
[06:22:12] bosses which is what you're gonna be
[06:22:13] doing in the memory of Chaos
[06:22:17] so yeah
[06:22:18] um what else is there
[06:22:23] I also need to make sure
[06:22:26] I need to make sure that my assessment
[06:22:27] of uh
[06:22:29] uh okay because I didn't really get to
[06:22:31] test this but
[06:22:34] the way the weakness thing works should
[06:22:36] be 50 50 or like evenly split
[06:22:39] based on all the types in your team
[06:22:41] regardless of how many of each type you
[06:22:43] have but I talked about this at the
[06:22:45] start of the stream but
[06:22:47] I need to make sure it's true that like
[06:22:50] uh even if you have three lightning
[06:22:52] characters in one Quantum it's still a
[06:22:53] 50 50 to get either lightning or Quantum
[06:22:55] assuming the enemy isn't like weak to
[06:22:57] any of them
[06:22:58] it should still be 50 50. like I'm
[06:23:01] pretty sure it's like an even split
[06:23:02] regardless of how many of each type you
[06:23:03] have but I didn't really have time to
[06:23:05] like test that
[06:23:34] I'm so [ __ ] tired
[06:23:42] you need a huge sample size well I mean
[06:23:45] okay if it's 75-25 you can notice if
[06:23:48] it's like not like if it's 50 50 like
[06:23:50] it's not like you know it's pretty it's
[06:23:52] relatively noticeable
[06:23:54] but like it would just take like [ __ ]
[06:23:56] 50 attempts
[06:23:58] help
[06:24:01] well
[06:24:07] go sleep I mean I have to record some
[06:24:09] stuff before I sleep
[06:24:10] uh
[06:24:12] uh but yeah so I'm gonna go [ __ ] then
[06:24:15] I'll stream again either tomorrow or in
[06:24:16] two days
[06:24:19] yeah and I'll try to upload the guide
[06:24:21] within a dare to as well so thanks for
[06:24:24] being here I love you all it was really
[06:24:26] fun and sorry I'm like I sound like low
[06:24:28] energy I'm tired as [ __ ] but I love all
[06:24:31] of you thanks for being here uh we could
[06:24:33] rate someone before I go or I could just
[06:24:35] end
[06:24:39] okay
[06:24:41] this is live let's write dish I like
[06:24:43] dish I mean there's a lot of people that
[06:24:45] are live that are cool but uh
[06:24:48] we're gonna read dish be normal though
[06:24:50] she's a nice wholesome streamer so you
[06:24:52] guys have to be normal and wholesome
[06:24:54] all right
[06:24:55] get in the raid
[06:24:57] have a nice rest thanks man yeah I'm
[06:24:59] [ __ ] tired but looking forward to
[06:25:02] finishing the guide and streaming again
[06:25:04] either tomorrow in two days
[06:25:07] I said to change a lot of things because
[06:25:08] I initially made everything assuming she
[06:25:10] needed way more EHR than she actually
[06:25:12] needs because they kind of Nerf they
[06:25:14] buffed it so now I have to figure out
[06:25:16] some things but it should be fine
[06:25:19] you
[06:25:21] a server's still not open I think she's
[06:25:23] good though I like the character I think
[06:25:25] she's better than I thought she was but
[06:25:27] I thought she was pretty decent so yeah
[06:25:30] well like on did you give her uh you sh
[06:25:32] you should typically go the event one
[06:25:33] the event one 40 hit rate and eight
[06:25:35] energy very very good I'm running the
[06:25:37] back one because it's the one I have
[06:25:38] leveled it's still pretty good but hit
[06:25:40] rate is typically uh more Universal
[06:25:43] unless you have a five star the five
[06:25:44] star icons are also pretty good
[06:26:00] and uh for the next stream I should have
[06:26:03] like other support characters leveled
[06:26:05] more so we could do memory of chaos
[06:26:06] hopefully unless I stream tomorrow then
[06:26:08] it'll we'll do that on stream but yeah
[06:26:10] all right thanks for being here guys be
[06:26:11] nice to this Ray's about to start see
[06:26:13] you soon bye guys thanks for all the new
[06:26:15] photos
[06:26:16] bye
