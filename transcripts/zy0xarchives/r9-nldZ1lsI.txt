[00:12:38] Hut
[00:12:39] pyro of all time there's this meme okay
[00:12:42] I saw this [ __ ] post of like best pyro
[00:12:46] now versus best pyro of all time and it
[00:12:49] was like a there's like a arlino and a
[00:12:50] Hut like edit right no leaks it's just
[00:12:52] like their pictures and I don't know how
[00:12:54] this app works but if I could I wanted
[00:12:56] to like take that and then it like trans
[00:12:59] to like a [ __ ] Shang Ling like edit
[00:13:01] and it's just like it's like a Shang
[00:13:02] Ling edit where like a that's
[00:13:13] like you guys want to hear my arino take
[00:13:16] you guys don't want to hear my arlino
[00:13:17] take okay this is no leaks right now
[00:13:19] okay no leaks she might be the most
[00:13:21] broken character we don't know no leaks
[00:13:23] this is my take it's going to be an
[00:13:26] incident where they're probably going to
[00:13:27] be good and fun but it's going to take 6
[00:13:30] months before it's acceptable to call
[00:13:32] strangling better that always happens
[00:13:33] with new pyro characters it usually
[00:13:35] takes like three to six months before
[00:13:37] you can like legally say that Shang
[00:13:39] Ling's better but it that doesn't mean
[00:13:41] that Pyro's bad it we'll see though
[00:13:44] could be
[00:13:46] wrong although I guess with with Linny
[00:13:49] it was day one with DEA it was day
[00:13:51] one with dude duuke took like six
[00:13:58] months
[00:14:00] please turn down the

[00:49:22] me who who uses Polar Star
[00:49:25] on
[00:49:32] okay okay I'm glad uh normal attacks are
[00:49:35] as needed on
[00:49:45] Kaza wow this
[00:49:51] is [ __ ] I'm on thundering Fury [ __ ] I'm
[00:49:55] an idiot
[00:49:59] okay it's
[00:50:01] fine drop by level 60 plus naushi thanks
[00:50:08] man wait it's actually called kazua
[00:50:10] slash I thought it was a joke yeah when
[00:50:12] you ult on kazua he has the chance of
[00:50:14] saying kazua slash it happens but it's a
[00:50:17] one in like 100 so should keep
[00:50:21] trying it's not even that bad it's just
[00:50:23] the popular it's whatever is popular so
[00:50:25] for Shia for example the tell you to
[00:50:27] level his dog [ __ ] Talent before the
[00:50:29] good one like Al is like not even close
[00:50:31] to normals so it depends on the
[00:50:33] character sometimes they're
[00:50:36] fine resin wise golden over TF for early
[00:50:39] Gamers yes but no yes but you could
[00:50:43] strongbox thundering Fury and thundering
[00:50:44] Fury helps with energy generation so
[00:50:46] it's more forgiving if your artifact
[00:50:47] suck balls for your whole team cuz you
[00:50:50] generate a lot of particles for
[00:50:54] everyone so I don't like that argument
[00:51:03] um okay that's all
[00:51:12] CH okay she might be level okay she
[00:51:15] might be okay okay she might be level 80
[00:51:19] for like two
[00:51:24] seconds she might be level 80 for like
[00:51:26] like two seconds because we need to get
[00:51:29] like five
[00:51:33] flowers but it's only going to be like 2
[00:51:44] seconds okay how many flowers I need
[00:51:46] okay I need like two flowers I have the
[00:51:47] I have those it's fine I need like two
[00:51:49] flowers I need literally like I need
[00:51:51] literally like two flowers I need
[00:51:53] literally like two flowers I I need
[00:51:55] literally like two flowers let me change
[00:51:57] my
[00:51:59] team I literally need like two
[00:52:03] flowers miss the first Tower what
[00:52:06] happened it's effectively two
[00:52:09] flowers
[00:52:10] um what was I doing I want to level this
[00:52:14] too
[00:52:15] e dude okay has anyone any mobile
[00:52:19] players try to hold the [ __ ] the like
[00:52:21] okay I don't know if this just a skill
[00:52:22] issue on my part but every time I try to
[00:52:24] tap and hold and my finger slide a
[00:52:26] little or there's like a bump on the
[00:52:28] road or anything happens it [ __ ] un
[00:52:30] it [ __ ]
[00:52:31] up it literally is
[00:52:34] impossible it's like the most dog [ __ ]
[00:52:36] dog [ __ ] to ever dog [ __ ] I can't hold
[00:52:39] with my
[00:52:40] finger why is everyone typing e for
[00:52:42] Harbinger it's better than the weapon
[00:52:44] you're using I guarantee it unless you
[00:52:46] pulled for her signature in which case
[00:52:48] nice nice
[00:52:55] cool
[00:53:15] okay
[00:53:17] cool uh okay something to keep in mind
[00:53:20] chat for characters with um I almost
[00:53:24] don't want to call it split scaling I
[00:53:26] want to say for characters with dual
[00:53:27] scaling because there's not really a
[00:53:29] difference between the two words but
[00:53:31] split makes it seem like it's a bad
[00:53:32] thing dual is like a good thing uh
[00:53:34] because it's not a bad thing uh do you
[00:53:37] know what is multiplied by all of this
[00:53:39] crit so build crit sorry yo Z thanks for
[00:53:44] the
[00:53:45] raid dude zag they were they were Ewing
[00:53:48] my harbinger of dawn what is the weapon
[00:53:50] ranking done so so we can whip it out on
[00:53:53] when we so I can whip my [ __ ] on the
[00:53:55] table
[00:53:56] sorry welcome to the stream thanks for
[00:53:58] the raid boy chori is a fun character I
[00:54:00] just love playing her and experiencing
[00:54:01] her animation amazing animation is a
[00:54:03] quality of life features such as forcing
[00:54:05] you to change your party order to
[00:54:08] something
[00:54:11] cringe um
[00:54:14] honestly okay this might be a a weird
[00:54:17] take but it usually the only thing that
[00:54:19] bothers me okay through my testing the
[00:54:21] only thing that bothers me with um with
[00:54:24] changing party order is if your DPS
[00:54:26] isn't first in in Star rail sometimes
[00:54:29] I'll like you'll like move some [ __ ]
[00:54:31] like for example if my Fan's on the on
[00:54:32] the end I'll put like blade next to her
[00:54:34] or some [ __ ] like there's like ways to
[00:54:35] do that that I don't like because I
[00:54:37] think it's ugly with chori usually
[00:54:39] you're not swapping to your DPS after I
[00:54:41] feel like well may I guess it depends on
[00:54:43] your team but like for example dude her
[00:54:45] up time's long enough so like let's say
[00:54:47] you're playing FAL you'd go chori and
[00:54:49] then FAL and that's fine and you're
[00:54:50] doing chori and then like Bennett or
[00:54:52] like Goro so it's you it's fine like you
[00:54:54] do like it dep it depends I haven't I
[00:54:57] haven't played every team yet
[00:54:58] though what if we're doing a Navia team
[00:55:01] let's say I put her here no benett would
[00:55:03] still
[00:55:04] be probably after her it would probably
[00:55:08] be finina then Bennett uh then shiori
[00:55:11] then Bennett so she would be there what
[00:55:13] oh I thought her head what the [ __ ] that
[00:55:15] jump scare wait I thought she lost her
[00:55:16] head what the [ __ ] did I just see okay
[00:55:19] my eyes are playing tricks on me I'm
[00:55:20] sorry wait what why did it look like
[00:55:22] that I don't know I thought she was
[00:55:25] decapitated yeah I don't know I don't
[00:55:27] know I don't know maybe I'm
[00:55:32] tired Harbinger wouldn't work like this
[00:55:35] dude do you just Yap without thinking
[00:55:37] what are you talking about if you play
[00:55:39] finina you can use cabar are you happy
[00:55:41] are you happy are you
[00:55:43] happy let us let us be content with a
[00:55:46] free three star weapon okay let us be
[00:55:48] happy with a free weapon okay we're not
[00:55:51] all
[00:55:52] multi-millionaires
[00:55:55] okay without geoc construct shy loses
[00:55:57] output without with geoc construct your
[00:56:00] team loses output because you're forced
[00:56:02] to play a geoc character now what yeah
[00:56:04] now what sorry that's true with um uh
[00:56:07] cinear with cinear uh if you have a Geo
[00:56:10] um construct you get two so in general
[00:56:12] with a GE construct you get two dolls
[00:56:14] and cinar smiddle only Buffs every 1.5
[00:56:17] seconds so if you have two dolls and
[00:56:18] they're offset a little bit unless
[00:56:20] they're like perfectly spaced out like
[00:56:21] 1.5 1.6 seconds between each hit uh
[00:56:24] you'll only buff one of the hits and not
[00:56:25] the other hit
[00:56:26] oh unless they hit at the same exact
[00:56:28] time so in practice uh while cinar is a
[00:56:31] great weapon better with like finina
[00:56:33] because Harbinger you can't use with
[00:56:34] finina good overall it's important to
[00:56:37] understand that it it's better
[00:56:39] comparatively to other weapons when you
[00:56:40] only have one doll out at the same time
[00:56:42] and if one doll out and if you have two
[00:56:44] dolls out you're playing with a
[00:56:45] construct right in an EO team with like
[00:56:47] uh well II is a construct but whatever a
[00:56:49] Geo team uh then cinar smiddle while
[00:56:51] it's still a good option is sort of less
[00:56:53] good in comparison because you're only
[00:56:55] buffing
[00:56:56] kind of half your hits it's not exactly
[00:56:58] half but like effectively you're only
[00:57:00] buffing one hit uh not both hits let's
[00:57:04] just say
[00:57:08] half how do I get the c
[00:57:11] bar oh you want cinar spindle no worries
[00:57:15] man I got you if you use your Prime
[00:57:17] subscription that's no no no you can D
[00:57:20] okay so I predict you can't get it right
[00:57:21] now I'm going to be honest no I'm honest
[00:57:23] I'm honest you can't get it right now
[00:57:24] you can't but I predict in version 5.7
[00:57:29] no 5.5 we're gonna get the event shop
[00:57:32] there's going to be event reruns and you
[00:57:34] can choose which event weapon you want
[00:57:36] from the event uh Galore Banner it's
[00:57:38] going to be like it's going to be called
[00:57:42] event shut up version 5.0 Nat Lan
[00:57:46] version 6.0 shz or whatever the [ __ ]
[00:57:49] version 7.0 back to monat we get event
[00:57:53] like an event that's every event in one
[00:57:56] you can choose which event weapon you
[00:57:57] want you can choose cabar spindle you
[00:57:59] can get fering desire for your finina so
[00:58:02] wait till version 7 point either 7.3 or
[00:58:13] 7.4 um okay I know this looks bad but I
[00:58:17] promise I have enough I have

[01:03:39] than her skill so it's not worth like
[01:03:41] building ER for it it's fine like okay
[01:03:44] the the like meta like the optimal
[01:03:46] answer is don't build ER for it my take
[01:03:49] is if you need like 10 or 20 in some Geo
[01:03:51] teams it's okay to get like one or two
[01:03:52] substats of it or three like to help you
[01:03:54] get it so you're not like switching back
[01:03:56] into her but like usually you just burst
[01:03:59] whenever you have
[01:04:09] it yeah uh I do like that team H can the
[01:04:13] the finina shenu and ETO team we'll

[01:24:19] to of Eternal flow actually very strong
[01:24:22] especially with finina right cuz you can
[01:24:25] manipulate your
[01:24:27] HP okay so far so good C6 Triple Crowns
[01:24:32] uh Crimson witch we like what we're
[01:24:34] seeing
[01:24:36] flower is not bad the 46 okay look look
[01:24:40] look when I see a piece with 46 flat
[01:24:42] defense my eyes can't go look away but
[01:24:44] it's unironically not bad okay
[01:24:47] feather wait I have the same 14 13.2
[01:24:51] wait a second wait a second wait a
[01:24:52] second I have a photogenic memory look
[01:24:54] look at this look at this look at this
[01:24:56] 14
[01:24:57] 30.2 how did he know how did he oh no
[01:25:00] but that was 14 crit rate whatever but
[01:25:03] basically standing
[01:25:15] around good good feather um uh no crit
[01:25:18] raate but decent Sands you know you got
[01:25:20] er you got CR damage uh not bad uh this
[01:25:22] power gobl has 86 element mental
[01:25:28] Mastery um I feel like this is good cuz
[01:25:31] you're vaping but I would be so pissed I
[01:25:34] mean okay it's actually good like Em's
[01:25:36] good on pyro characters but I would be
[01:25:37] so pissed if I have a double crit and it
[01:25:39] just all goes em but this is really good
[01:25:41] you have a a crit roll a crit roll and
[01:25:43] like four em 20 plus 20 plus 20 plus 20
[01:25:46] so I guess three on top of the initial
[01:25:48] one uh that's a lot that's a lot a lot
[01:25:50] of good
[01:25:52] stats cir
[01:26:01] okay I'm going to pretend I didn't see
[01:26:02] the ciret but overall very good Yen uh
[01:26:05] keep in mind that if you're playing
[01:26:06] finina you can also use Mari Hunter
[01:26:08] right because your HP is going to be
[01:26:09] moving around uh if you don't want to
[01:26:11] use Crimson witch um but your goet is
[01:26:14] insane and a lot of your pieces are
[01:26:15] pretty good also you can use a little
[01:26:16] bit of crit rate but uh uh uh you
[01:26:23] know
[01:26:35] if has crit raate cons yeah but it's not
[01:26:36] that much right she only has 60 it's
[01:26:40] like it's 20 right
[01:26:47] chat yeah 20 you only have 60 so yeah
[01:26:51] you can use it's good though it's good
[01:26:52] it's actually good it's good I don't
[01:26:53] know what level of like what type of
[01:26:55] advice you're asking if you want me to
[01:26:56] just say it's good I'll just say it's
[01:26:57] good but real if you want to optimiz it
[01:26:59] more you can get a bit more crit rate or
[01:27:01] you can do Mar but it's very
[01:27:11] strong
[01:27:18] Shia okay what half should we
[01:27:21] play actually okay first question EO or
[01:27:34] yeah I see more Navas but Navia will
[01:27:38] only have one doll unless we do triple
[01:27:40] goo but I do not want to play triple
[01:27:46] goo oh I mean well we'll just play both
[01:27:49] I think we do EO first half Navia second
[01:27:53] half
[01:27:56] what the [ __ ] is this [ __ ]
[01:27:59] song dude why are you [ __ ] on Rich
[01:28:03] Flex 21 can you do something for me
[01:28:08] sorry it it's not that great but someone
[01:28:12] said misogynist fine I won't playo we'll
[01:28:15] play Navia I'm sorry I'm sorry we'll
[01:28:18] play Navia fine but now I have to second
[01:28:22] half it ca because Navia is better

[01:29:05] harbinger of dawn which means in order
[01:29:07] to play Navia I need finina but in order
[01:29:08] to play chori I need no finina which
[01:29:11] creates a paradox because you can't play
[01:29:13] one without the
[01:29:18] other okay we're starting with EO we'll
[01:29:20] do Navia right after where's

[01:32:17] shenyun oh my God I just realized
[01:32:19] something my Shen's not on oh my God I
[01:32:22] have the gear again yeah
[01:32:28] F from my perspective I think the new
[01:32:31] character is more complicated to build
[01:32:32] because you need to focus on two states
[01:32:34] attack and defense how is that possible
[01:32:35] no you don't you build crit and damage
[01:32:37] because it Buffs both you're welcome
[01:32:38] just build crit defense is also better
[01:32:41] than attack because the scaling number
[01:32:42] is higher and her base defense is higher
[01:32:43] than her base attack although weapons
[01:32:45] change that but that's it you don't need
[01:32:46] to think further than
[01:32:48] that the only thing it does is like
[01:32:52] technically you could do like attack
[01:32:53] attack sand if your attack sand is way
[01:32:55] better than
[01:33:02] defense okay we're testing fast equip
[01:33:04] quick
[01:33:05] configuration oh my God it [ __ ]
[01:33:08] worked it [ __ ]
[01:33:11] worked she has 120 ER but it's fine
[01:33:13] because I have her
[01:33:18] signature that's it's it's very low ER
[01:33:21] but it's
[01:33:22] fine what the the [ __ ] is
[01:33:28] this okay this build kind of sucks I
[01:33:31] cannot lie but it's good
[01:33:37] enough you need like 180 dude I do I do

[02:04:18] time left in this clear oops wrong
[02:04:20] character because my [ __ ] first half
[02:04:22] was
[02:04:33] poop missed Kaza E I hope in life
[02:04:38] whenever you miss something someone is
[02:04:39] there to remind you okay because that's
[02:04:41] what yeah I definitely missed it but
[02:04:43] that's that's what twitch chat is like
[02:04:44] okay sometimes [ __ ] happens why do you
[02:04:46] have to no why do you have to bring it
[02:04:49] up [ __ ] happens
[02:04:58] [ __ ] happens
[02:05:00] sometimes
[02:05:05] die Sil okay
[02:05:12] cool because you keep yapping about
[02:05:14] being perfect even Einstein made
[02:05:17] mistakes even even even even even
[02:05:22] Aristotle Mis
[02:05:25] miscalculated even
[02:05:27] Pythagoras only didn't theorize his
[02:05:31] theorem until he made other
[02:05:34] ones you don't hear about his his hypo
[02:05:37] hypothesis you don't hear about his
[02:05:39] attempts you hear about his theorem
[02:05:41] right you know that a squ plus b s
[02:05:43] equals c s but you don't know about the
[02:05:45] other six that he did before okay so you
[02:05:47] can still you can be correct and wrong
[02:05:50] at the same time push my push my buttons
[02:05:53] again see what happens I dare
[02:05:59] you to shine I Am The Cutting Edge of
[02:06:03] fashion I Am The Cutting Edge of

[02:06:20] dude
[02:06:22] valow
[02:06:23] aim this is why second half is better
[02:06:26] because second half Navia is so like you
[02:06:29] just boom on one enemy and you're
[02:06:31] chilling but this half there's two so
[02:06:33] you have to like line it up never mind I
[02:06:35] just did
[02:06:37] it that was easy actually do I suck what
[02:06:40] the [ __ ] that was so easy I'm trying to

[02:07:22] me I think I don't know why I used
[02:07:25] finina before nav I think it's cuz I
[02:07:26] forgot but it actually worked out so
[02:07:28] we're going to do it again just because
[02:07:29] it
[02:07:34] worked your on it I
[02:07:37] missed you die I hope that enemy trips

[02:23:56] play whatever you desire
[02:24:00] okay okay let me let me test cabar
[02:24:02] spindle to to show you like to make
[02:24:06] sure that it actually doesn't
[02:24:10] work well not that it doesn't work but
[02:24:13] you know what I
[02:24:14] mean uh so let's just do that with a
[02:24:18] construct I'll put a Healer too
[02:24:31] so if I put a construct and I skill it
[02:24:34] should only
[02:24:35] buff I think it Buffs um the first two
[02:24:38] hits cuz they hit at the same time no
[02:24:39] they
[02:24:42] don't
[02:24:48] yeah oh that one it buff what the [ __ ]
[02:24:50] they hit at the same
[02:24:52] time
[02:24:56] yeah cringe let me try
[02:25:00] again let me do e then wait a second
[02:25:03] then
[02:25:05] construct
[02:25:06] 23
[02:25:08] 18
[02:25:11] eight wait [ __ ] I'm not critting that
[02:25:17] often well I don't have enough crit rate
[02:25:19] to tell
[02:25:35] ga yeah it's
[02:25:38] not if you space it correctly to get the
[02:25:41] buff that is okay I'm going to say it
[02:25:43] I'm sorry that's not happening I'm sorry
[02:25:45] I'm actually sorry that's not
[02:25:48] happening no you are not doing that to
[02:25:50] use your event
[02:25:53] weapon
[02:25:59] customer like look they're spaced out
[02:26:01] but it's
[02:26:03] oh but now it [ __ ] up yeah see those
[02:26:06] are different
[02:26:12] numbers wait let me build let me build
[02:26:14] 100 CR rate one sec let me build 100 CR
[02:26:16] rate I don't have enough CR rate for
[02:26:18] this [ __ ]
[02:26:22] oh I need c bar sorry sorry sorry dude
[02:26:26] shut up man
[02:26:30] [ __ ]
[02:26:45] fine where's kakomi there she
[02:26:49] is
[02:26:59] crumble 19
[02:27:02] 14
[02:27:04] 19 19 that one buffed both SE well
[02:27:11] 19 14 it buffed some like
[02:27:16] sometime it Buffs some but not
[02:27:19] all
[02:27:21] like that time it buffed more than what
[02:27:22] I was expecting wait let me use my let
[02:27:24] me hold it let me hold
[02:27:26] it
[02:27:32] solidy 23
[02:27:35] 17 22 well it's basically 23
[02:27:39] 17 23 17
[02:27:43] yeah what if I
[02:27:49] do
[02:27:51] unless you can do it reliably it feels
[02:27:52] like their timing [ __ ] I okay I I tried
[02:27:55] this for like an hour earlier and like
[02:27:58] it feels like it it un timings like I
[02:28:01] don't know how to explain it but it
[02:28:02] feels like it'll like buff both hits and
[02:28:04] then one will hit and then the other one
[02:28:05] will hit later like I don't get why it's
[02:28:07] like different like it feels like
[02:28:09] they're not synced or they start synced
[02:28:10] and they unsync but I don't know what
[02:28:12] makes them unsync I don't I'm not I
[02:28:13] don't get
[02:28:16] it let's
[02:28:19] go
[02:28:22] my clothes are
[02:28:24] ruined like both there are
[02:28:28] 17
[02:28:31] 17 never mind I got
[02:28:34] it w I actually got it
[02:28:38] there you just got her true
[02:28:47] actually oh I guess it's if an enemy
[02:28:49] goes of range probably cuz that their
[02:28:52] range is [ __ ] tiny as [ __ ] so
[02:28:54] sometimes the enemies only hit like well
[02:28:56] I mean I guess that's not even that bad
[02:28:58] never
[02:29:14] accept instead of using cinear you can
[02:29:16] use Shang
[02:29:18] Ling okay
[02:29:29] stabiliz
[02:29:39] yeah yeah yeah if you if you have a
[02:29:42] constract is not going to work so pass
[02:29:44] your first rotation it's not going to
[02:29:45] buff it right so I guess it doesn't
[02:29:48] really matter
[02:29:52] like you can try hard time it for your
[02:29:54] first rotation but then for everything
[02:29:55] else the construct's still there unless
[02:29:57] the enemy walks over
[02:29:59] it I mean maybe not if you're using like
[02:30:01] ushi I guess ushi goes
[02:30:08] away oh
[02:30:14] anys can you explain the new wish
[02:30:18] no yeah I mean already did uh it's not
[02:30:22] it's not ideal but if you want the
[02:30:23] characters on it or the weapon then you
[02:30:26] know you you can use it for you there
[02:30:28] you go poggers right okay let's do a
[02:30:32] full
[02:30:33] clear
[02:30:37] um another
[02:30:48] one
[02:31:16] all right we're going to play Navia
[02:31:18] second half this time that's what what I
[02:31:20] actually think is going to be good
[02:31:21] Navia probably
[02:31:23] finina I think we say [ __ ] the bow we do
[02:31:26] Navia finina
[02:31:31] chori and [ __ ] the
[02:31:35] bow and then we
[02:31:40] do Z would' be cool and Tall if you
[02:31:42] played
[02:31:44] Wanderer okay
[02:31:48] here
[02:32:01] there you go I'll play our Animo Animo
[02:32:04] Squad uh finina
[02:32:07] chori
[02:32:14] Bennett all
[02:32:18] right
[02:32:25] what healer use with finina chori ETO
[02:32:29] okay the problem is you really really
[02:32:33] really want Goro if you can with Ito
[02:32:36] like you might as well so if you're Goro
[02:32:38] C4 and you actually can heal uh good
[02:32:41] luck but if not it's like Bennett um or
[02:32:46] technically you can shun finina but it's
[02:32:49] usually
[02:32:52] benett or C4
[02:32:55] Goro or a really interesting thing you
[02:32:57] can do for that team is you take EO and
[02:33:00] you replace it with
[02:33:02] Noel and then you can Goro
[02:33:09] sorry that's not it for finina yeah but
[02:33:11] at that like I am not a big fan of
[02:33:13] benching Goro like use your finina for
[02:33:15] better things if you're not healing
[02:33:17] enough have fun use your finina on your
[02:33:18] other team I'm not a big fan of like
[02:33:21] eing and then just benching your
[02:33:23] Goro like I'm sure it's
[02:33:26] fine
[02:33:28] but actually no I'm not sure it's
[02:33:32] fine I don't like doing
[02:33:36] that what's the opinion she's like albo
[02:33:40] 1.5 make of that what you
[02:33:43] will she's an upgrade to albo but like
[02:33:46] do you need an upgrade to
[02:33:48] albo
[02:33:58] worthless
[02:34:10] worthless she's prettier so yes well I
[02:34:13] wasn't implying no okay rip scar like I
[02:34:15] don't think she's bad at all it's just
[02:34:17] like not everyone wants an albo it's
[02:34:19] like she's good for like the your Geo
[02:34:23] teams um like she's pretty good there
[02:34:25] her damage is pretty
[02:34:30] good like it like you know for off field
[02:34:33] especially if you can get two dolls n
[02:34:35] teams can't with CZ

[03:44:40] showcase at this point [ __ ] if
[03:44:42] Bennett was released today you'd say go
[03:44:43] do a b Shang link showcase
[03:44:46] it's a support character what do you
[03:44:47] want if you onfield Geo infuser chori
[03:44:51] normal tax I'm sorry brother but God
[03:44:54] like you need you shouldn't I I don't
[03:44:56] even know what to tell you I don't even
[03:44:58] know what to tell
[03:45:03] you Ham's
[03:45:13] doses w
[03:45:15] oh yeah what's my rotation yolan has a
[03:45:19] long duration on all but um I feel like
[03:45:22] I don't want to weave normal attacks and
[03:45:23] between shiori's garbage so I kind of
[03:45:25] want a chiori before
[03:45:31] her uh who's my last slot Jong Lee but
[03:45:34] Jang Le is probably first so Jong Lee
[03:45:38] and then I mean I could do yolan chori
[03:45:40] and go straight to
[03:45:43] Navia
[03:45:48] you want Chi before Navia for the quick
[03:45:49] swap
[03:45:54] why like why like what why why would it
[03:45:57] have to be in that
[03:45:59] order G MC people said
[03:46:04] fishing for
[03:46:06] fun e swap yeah but you could swap to
[03:46:08] someone else why does it matter that
[03:46:11] it's Navia like I'm doing that here but
[03:46:13] like it doesn't matter right
[03:46:22] level 87 why okay there's actually a
[03:46:25] really really uh important reason don't
[03:46:28] okay so this is something you should
[03:46:30] know before you level yours to 90 uh
[03:46:32] what I did is at level 80 I chose to use
[03:46:35] all of my books and I ran out and so she
[03:46:37] got stuck at 87 um so keep that in mind
[03:46:40] when you're uh pulling and when you're
[03:46:42] leveling your
[03:46:43] character
[03:46:51] Goro for geot team uh yes for etto but
[03:46:54] Navia doesn't skill so okay Navia
[03:46:56] doesn't use defense J Le doesn't use
[03:46:57] defense yolan doesn't use defense she
[03:46:59] already does but she doesn't snapshot so
[03:47:01] she doesn't use [ __ ] [ __ ] like Goro
[03:47:03] and shiori could have been the best duo
[03:47:04] in the world but they don't do [ __ ] well
[03:47:06] like okay Goro C6 still Buffs your Geo
[03:47:09] damage he's still not useless he still
[03:47:11] would provide a bit of value but yeah

[04:22:08] now yapper of the
[04:22:11] century
[04:22:15] today we are speedrunning genin impact
[04:22:18] with four C6 shs however I don't really
[04:22:21] play Shia and to be
[04:22:24] honest can you make your TTS like
[04:22:28] this I was going to censor the no no

[04:22:44] okay I have to pee give me a second you
[04:22:46] guys can look at
[04:23:11] chiori
[04:23:41] for
[04:24:05] it's up to me to decide who I want to be
[04:24:08] and to cut my own path no one can tell
[04:24:11] me what to do
[04:24:41] oh
[04:24:57] if you really like standing around like

[04:25:31] [ __ ] I said it before it started

[04:25:36] single Target bosses it's going to make
[04:25:39] this character look bad if it's compared
[04:25:41] to a bunch of other c6s because because
[04:25:43] Shia C6 only works in AOE whereas was C6

[04:31:10] true
[04:31:15] why is bro in a suit yeah I'm into
[04:31:17] fashion tell me more chori I'm also into
[04:31:20] fashion I hope we have some form of
[04:31:22] mutual respect as
[04:31:29] co-workers sorry I have
[04:31:36] to when will you play Elder ring I will
[04:31:39] download it right now you think I'm
[04:31:40] joking I'll download it right now me so
[04:31:43] donated $1 bro then check my first Don M
[04:31:47] you could have just you could have spent
[04:31:49] that dollar telling me what it is you
[04:31:50] wanted to tell me instead of saying go
[04:31:52] check my last one I can't find it now m
[04:31:55] is
[04:32:00] two Tri chori or Navia at chat Dam
[04:32:04] they're not even asking me I was going
[04:32:05] to answer that they said at chat I'll
[04:32:07] I'll see myself out I'm sorry oh I need
[04:32:09] to change my team order one sec
[04:32:17] why does that say boring to play like
[04:32:18] any other sub DPS I mean I don't know
[04:32:21] his opinion not mine I do think that the
[04:32:23] the annoying part that I heard him say
[04:32:25] is the the team stuff like it's annoying
[04:32:28] that if I start the abyss like this I
[04:32:29] would have to leave because chori
[04:32:31] swapping to Jong Le is a waste of my
[04:32:32] entire life so it would have to be like
[04:32:36] this I think is that even the
[04:32:39] order it might be shenyun no I think
[04:32:42] that's
[04:32:49] it Don
[04:32:52] [Music]
[04:32:53] match thank you
[04:32:55] pipo for the dollar now that's a minus
[04:32:58] that's minus like four
[04:33:08] total I don't get her switching stuff
[04:33:11] she just goes to your next character
[04:33:12] that's it that's literally it all that
[04:33:14] happens is you swap your next character
[04:33:16] so you want to be sure that when you
[04:33:17] swap your next character like that's you
[04:33:19] want to play next like Jong Le for
[04:33:21] example usually start your rotation with
[04:33:23] this pillar so you wouldn't want to like
[04:33:26] if let's say I do that and then I go
[04:33:28] chor and I go back to Jang Le like I'm
[04:33:29] just wasting my
[04:33:31] time that's it why is that puppet side
[04:33:35] eyeing
[04:33:40] you
[04:33:58] Skyward H yeah scatter
[04:34:02] sorry hey Z have you ever tried shutting
[04:34:04] the [ __ ] up like I'm just asking as a
[04:34:06] friend I'm just asking as a friend not a
[04:34:10] foe
[04:34:14] I XO donated $1 I says make your TTS
[04:34:18] like this minus 4 I hope you st your toe
[04:34:21] on the next time well now it's minus now
[04:34:24] it's now it's really minus four if I cuz
[04:34:26] I can't click on links from Dons so
[04:34:28] actually minus four but I don't think
[04:34:30] I'm going to change my GTS I might just
[04:34:31] make it louder I'm not sure what you're
[04:34:33] referencing though I Am The Cutting Ed
[04:34:36] of
[04:34:40] drink
[04:34:43] disappear don't ever shut off your Clips
[04:34:44] or when I what I watch when I'm sad okay
[04:34:47] now what if I said now I I hope they
[04:34:50] make you feel better but also if they
[04:34:52] don't then that makes you sad more often
[04:34:54] which makes you watch my Clips more so
[04:34:56] technically as a capitalist I would want
[04:34:59] you to stay sad so [ __ ] you I'm sorry I
[04:35:03] I'm sorry I'm sorry I don't actually Yap

[04:35:35] that
[04:35:38] true dude in real life I'm like I'm I'm
[04:35:41] more quiet it cuz like dude if you start

[04:36:32] this one where I got a good feather and
[04:36:34] and people are like wait till your ZX I
[04:36:37] thought you a middle-aged man playing
[04:36:40] genin what
[04:36:42] anyways this is what I was referencing
[04:36:44] so this is where all my good Vermillion
[04:36:46] pieces what the [ __ ] is this so this is
[04:36:48] where all my good Vermillion pieces went
[04:36:49] and it's like I don't want people to
[04:36:51] think that I'm lucky in Vermilion
[04:36:53] because this is all they see of me so
[04:36:55] I'm I think we need to release a
[04:36:57] compilation of me getting unlucky or
[04:36:58] something I'm going to have to go
[04:36:59] through like clip channels and like my
[04:37:01] clips and like compile that [ __ ] cuz
[04:37:03] there's for every good Vermilion piece
[04:37:06] there's like 60 bad ones so we need to
[04:37:09] we're going to need to set the record
[04:37:10] straight

[04:37:50] okay chat I was thinking about
[04:37:52] something I was thinking about
[04:37:56] something I would rather spend 100,000
[04:38:01] resin I would rather spend 300,000 resin
[04:38:05] than spend 10,000 and not have a good
[04:38:07] shot I would rather spend 100,000 resin
[04:38:10] and not have a good build spend 10,000
[04:38:12] resent and not have a good build do you
[04:38:13] know why because if I spend 10,000 and I
[04:38:16] don't have a good build then that means
[04:38:17] I gave up I gave up after 10 I said [ __ ]
[04:38:19] it I'm done but if I spend 100,000 that
[04:38:22] means I'm keep going that means I'm
[04:38:24] persistent through all the
[04:38:26] [ __ ] through all the [ __ ] I'd rather
[04:38:29] keep going I'd rather fail 20 times than
[04:38:32] fail

[04:50:10] long does it take how long how much do I
[04:50:12] have to do it or should I do it off
[04:50:13] stream complete other quest to start
[04:50:15] wait what is
[04:50:20] this oh
[04:50:26] my there's a skip button in Hangouts
[04:50:30] now wait really no you're
[04:50:39] trolling wait when did they add
[04:50:43] that in 4.0 oh do you mean like where
[04:50:47] you can like go back to like a certain
[04:50:49] spot cuz I think I might have done that
[04:50:50] then I did that for I did um yunas and
[04:50:53] Kaaya so I probably did
[04:50:56] it unless they just added
[04:51:01] it no they added skip this patch wait
[04:51:09] really
[04:51:17] K has a video about it wait actually
[04:51:21] skip button genin let's see what
[04:51:25] happens oh my God guys they added the
[04:51:29] skip button here in gansin but sadly
[04:51:33] sadly it only works in hangout events
[04:51:36] for now you [ __ ] you [ __ ] know you
[04:51:40] you can had that but you can't give it
[04:51:41] to me in ging but sadly sadly it only
[04:51:45] works in hangout events for now at least
[04:51:49] for my testing if you want the skip
[04:51:51] button to appear you must complete uh
[04:51:54] actually you must read that part of the
[04:51:56] story one time first and then it will
[04:51:58] appear else it will not I already tried
[04:52:01] for example for the daily commission for
[04:52:03] the world Quests for the story quests
[04:52:06] you don't have the skip button and you
[04:52:08] also don't have the skip button for the
[04:52:10] old hang out events for example F if I
[04:52:13] start again from this part here an
[04:52:15] academic problem as you can see the skip
[04:52:18] button is not here and the reason is
[04:52:20] because it's the first time I'm reading
[04:52:22] the story from this patch [ __ ] I mean
[04:52:26] that's not bad that's actually fine cuz
[04:52:28] now cuz I I usually don't give a [ __ ]
[04:52:30] about Hangouts but I want to get I want
[04:52:32] to get a th achievements before fonted
[04:52:34] ends that's my goal I want to get 1
[04:52:35] th000 achievements so I actually have to
[04:52:36] do Hangouts cuz they give so many so
[04:52:39] this actually kind of clutch
[04:52:43] uh I mean I wish we had it the the
[04:52:45] [ __ ] okay I I don't know I mean I
[04:52:49] don't know I feel like World quests
[04:52:50] could get like if you don't want to give
[04:52:51] it to like story quests archon quests I
[04:52:54] get it right cuz it's like okay you're
[04:52:56] going to sell more if more people look
[04:52:58] at finina during her story Quest like I
[04:53:00] get it but I Feel Like A world quest
[04:53:03] like who gives a [ __ ] I mean like the
[04:53:04] rnrs were good the RNR Quest was good I
[04:53:07] don't know want the skip button to spawn

[05:17:18] too much like you're overcooking kakomi
[05:17:21] dude we're chilling we need crit damage

[05:21:12] would you ask dumb [ __ ] like
[05:21:18] that okay we're not clearing this but
[05:21:21] the first time was

[05:39:55] maybe 50 maybe 100 maybe 200 then that
[05:39:59] could be a worthwhile investment for
[05:40:01] you but if you make your decision I
[05:40:05] would make your decision either before
[05:40:08] she's out or when you see her gameplay I
[05:40:11] wouldn't I wouldn't keep it as a
[05:40:14] question mark because whenever you're
[05:40:15] like I don't know if I will you're going
[05:40:16] to end up getting peer pressured by a
[05:40:17] bunch of clickbait okay so either know
[05:40:20] your decision before or what the [ __ ]
[05:40:22] can't do my daily [ __ ] it just pull just
[05:40:25] pull I don't care anymore gamble just

[05:58:32] loud okay uh I'm going to do probably an
[05:58:35] abyss clear on Chi I think off stream
[05:58:37] honestly so I can like eat first but for

[05:58:46] the guide and the guide will be out
[05:58:47] today within 24 hours um spelled Mary
[05:58:50] wrong [ __ ] you did I no I didn't
[05:58:56] anyways okay first of all use Harbinger
[05:59:00] Dawn or you're coping don't even talk to
[05:59:02] me
[05:59:04] uh wait
[05:59:07] what what okay okay I'm done I'm done
[05:59:12] I'm done I'm done don't talk to me we're
[05:59:13] not playing anymore I'm done wait for
[05:59:15] how long wait for how long wait she was
[05:59:18] wait wa wait wait wait this wasn't all
[05:59:20] stream cuz I was on cinear so it was
[05:59:22] it's only like okay I'm tilted I'm F
[05:59:25] dude I'm so pissed what the [ __ ] okay in
[05:59:28] my defense this is still a good ratio
[05:59:31] okay but what the [ __ ] is
[05:59:35] this I think this was recently this has
[05:59:37] to have been recently this has to have
[05:59:39] been
[05:59:42] recently it was all fake kek
[05:59:56] L probably drink ning Wong gear maybe if
[05:59:59] it was that then that's not that
[06:00:04] bad
[06:00:14] anyways for the most part she's pretty
[06:00:16] easy to build she's basically albo 2 but
[06:00:18] a bit better right her
[06:00:20] scaling Z are just better for the most
[06:00:24] part uh I don't know if I can compare
[06:00:26] them adequately because my ALB is a
[06:00:28] different Talent level but where the
[06:00:30] [ __ ] my
[06:00:34] albo oh no it's not but yeah like
[06:00:39] basically just more damage than
[06:00:41] albo
[06:00:44] um and albo's pretty decent but he's not
[06:00:47] like needed and it's usually like both
[06:00:50] are fine for Gio she is a good side
[06:00:54] grade to upgrade like upgrade
[06:00:57] usually she's she's good but she's not
[06:00:59] like needed cuz the teams you run her
[06:01:01] with are Geo so it's like do you want to
[06:01:03] play that sure get her if not eh right
[06:01:06] and you could use her with albo if you
[06:01:07] want you can use her with it's usually
[06:01:09] EO or Navia as your DPS Noel can be fine
[06:01:12] too
[06:01:14] um like you don't need like I wouldn't
[06:01:16] recommend getting her if you're just
[06:01:17] like a a non Geo player but for geo
[06:01:21] teams she's pretty good and
[06:01:24] for like you can use her as like a flex
[06:01:26] with like the way you use albo the only
[06:01:28] downside is she doesn't give the EM that
[06:01:30] he gives but this is also like only
[06:01:32] after you burst and [ __ ] for 10 seconds
[06:01:36] um whereas chiori gives you with another
[06:01:38] Gio if you have at least one with a
[06:01:40] construct she gives quite a lot of
[06:01:41] damage if you don't it's still fine it's
[06:01:43] not as good I think she's
[06:01:50] okay talent and changer glider I'm
[06:01:52] pretty sure that's any party member it's
[06:01:53] not just her and also it's uh it's
[06:01:56] doesn't work in domains troun domains
[06:01:58] and the spiral Abyss so it doesn't
[06:02:04] matter
[06:02:24] um I haven't counted her particles
[06:02:26] though like I don't know if albo
[06:02:28] generates a bit more energy that could
[06:02:30] be the only upside but like damage wise
[06:02:32] she's um she's
[06:02:34] higher
[06:02:53] don't use Harbinger with finina no with
[06:02:55] finina you go cinear uh wol Fang is also
[06:02:58] always a good option and any of the five
[06:03:00] well any of these like crit five stars
[06:03:01] are really good too potentially better
[06:03:03] and then her signature is the best Jade
[06:03:05] cutters the second
[06:03:11] best wolf
[06:03:17] meow she's pretty
[06:03:20] cool is she only good in Geo teams she's
[06:03:23] only meta in Geo teams but like for
[06:03:25] other teams you could just like a lot of
[06:03:27] teams are three-unit teams you can slap
[06:03:28] a flex character and that character's
[06:03:29] fine chori can work there she can also
[06:03:32] work in double Geo teams like if I'm
[06:03:33] playing like I played Shia shenu double
[06:03:35] Gio was it better than [ __ ] finina
[06:03:38] farzon no not even close but is it still
[06:03:41] a good team yeah like it works right
[06:03:42] like you can do that it's a little cope
[06:03:45] but it's it
[06:03:51] works where's the yapping I've been live
[06:03:53] for 6 hours I am out of
[06:03:59] Yap who she best slot with EO Goro Flex
[06:04:02] or Navia and then anything like you
[06:04:05] could do like finina shenu and finina
[06:04:07] Bennett uh fishal Bennett usually
[06:04:10] Bennett something or finina but you
[06:04:13] could finina Bennett
[06:04:18] too
[06:04:21] aboba yeah why is our ster mode a
