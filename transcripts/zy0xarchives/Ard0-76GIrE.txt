[00:12:00] record let me say something okay if we
[00:12:03] watch the gench one we might make that
[00:12:04] into a video because I'm very qualified
[00:12:06] gench wise star I'm not I'm not in the
[00:12:08] I'm not I'm not here to tell you if your
[00:12:10] main is is laughable or not okay I'm not
[00:12:13] a bully in genin I'm a bit of a bully no
[00:12:14] I'm not but in St I'm nice okay I'm nice
[00:12:17] don't type benched game okay I know
[00:12:19] who's good I just I'm I'm more of a okay
[00:12:22] it's a turn battle Auto simulator have
[00:12:24] fun that's all but I love starl we're
[00:12:26] playing it today this is literally a
[00:12:27] Star Stream we're playing St
[00:12:29] today it
[00:12:32] is I'm sure this is going to be great
[00:12:34] it's hard to [ __ ] up who's strong and St
[00:12:36] you can [ __ ] tell it's not rocket
[00:12:38] science you can tell when a character is
[00:12:40] good you can [ __ ] tell the very top
[00:12:42] of the current there's some exceptions
[00:12:44] suan suan kind of surprise people at E6
[00:12:48] but for the most part you can tell
[00:12:50] number 10
[00:12:53] Kafka anyone who says lightning never
[00:12:56] strikes the same place twice has clearly
[00:12:58] never met at Kafka while her damage
[00:13:00] output looks under could stri mece the
[00:13:02] initial hit is only part of the story
[00:13:04] you see Kafka is the queen of the long
[00:13:06] game also of skills okay before I react
[00:13:09] to anything we have to first I have to
[00:13:11] see what two rankings are because I
[00:13:13] don't know what number 10 is right now
[00:13:14] because if this is 10 I'm expecting like
[00:13:17] nine Banger characters in front here
[00:13:20] nine
[00:13:22] bangers F all three give me all supports
[00:13:25] [ __ ] it silver wolf [ __ ] [ __ ]
[00:13:27] Sniper Wolf [ __ ] it she's here fry
[00:13:30] around her it's a sight to behold in
[00:13:32] fact kafka's consistent access to status
[00:13:34] effects makes her one of the most
[00:13:35] reliable damage dealers in the whole
[00:13:37] cast shocking isn't it shocking boom
[00:13:41] she's pretty I like her for do teams I
[00:13:44] mean she's kind of needed for them fwan
[00:13:46] as okay I don't know about number nine
[00:13:48] but
[00:13:49] okay there's one very good reason to
[00:13:52] always keep fan kind of carries you to
[00:13:54] put it simply I feel like I don't know
[00:13:55] if I can name nine better characters or
[00:13:57] eight better characters but maybe her
[00:13:58] Litany of regenerative abilities she can
[00:14:00] keep no actually there's no way you can
[00:14:02] just about any attack even better she
[00:14:05] can do the same with her team Fan's
[00:14:07] unique skill allows her to partly Shield
[00:14:09] her allies damage intake for three wait
[00:14:10] why the [ __ ] does this guy have 1K crit
[00:14:12] damage pair that with her insane healing
[00:14:14] and Fan's party becomes nigh unkillable
[00:14:17] oh and did we mention fwan nine is crazy
[00:14:19] and there's no way fwan is nine but
[00:14:21] listen at least if they only name good
[00:14:23] characters and the ORD wrong I won't
[00:14:25] even be that upset genuinely although it
[00:14:27] is top 10 so the order has to be right F
[00:14:29] run should be higher but yeah simil
[00:14:31] Universe I know but but but oh is it the
[00:14:34] new one clearly she doesn't just support
[00:14:35] your lineup she's the reason it's
[00:14:37] effective at
[00:14:38] all I know the tooth you can consume for
[00:14:41] crit damage like your coins which is how
[00:14:43] people get like 30k and [ __ ] number
[00:14:45] eight
[00:14:46] CA okay all right okay all right calm
[00:14:49] down there buddy okay all right we're
[00:14:51] starting the video off listen no
[00:14:53] disrespect to cely okay no disrespect
[00:14:55] she goes eight times in a row no
[00:14:57] disrespect but you're not putting her
[00:14:58] above F why is her name fan by the way
[00:15:01] look at these am I blocking this look
[00:15:03] the name is
[00:15:04] fan and C well cap Go's right and then
[00:15:09] CA
[00:15:13] what
[00:15:15] anyways yeah we're still in the genin
[00:15:16] category but we're playing stel today
[00:15:18] after gen we're doing a bit of genin
[00:15:19] then stel kill him this 10 months K
[00:15:21] playing number eight CA got a lot of
[00:15:26] ner in comparison to flashy skill debuff
[00:15:29] mechanics and situational ultimates CA
[00:15:31] is pretty straightforward she simply
[00:15:33] does damage and a lot of it however in a
[00:15:36] game like honkai Star rail that alone
[00:15:38] wouldn't be enough to make her stand out
[00:15:40] especially since she's limited to single
[00:15:41] targets but that's where ca's Uber
[00:15:43] powerful Talent Resurgence comes into
[00:15:45] play whenever she eliminates an enemy
[00:15:47] Resurgence Buffs her attack what the
[00:15:49] [ __ ] is what the [ __ ] is that UI bro
[00:15:53] Target Master but the versatility to
[00:15:55] plow through hordes at the same time so
[00:15:57] whether you're chipping away at a boss
[00:15:59] or grinding through grunts sa always
[00:16:01] deserves a spot on your team uh I mean
[00:16:03] she's I honestly like cely I don't think
[00:16:05] she's above the other character
[00:16:09] butf sure of seven
[00:16:13] blade my man sorry my sword will be the
[00:16:18] last thing you see given his name it's
[00:16:21] blade is the epitome of a glass Cannon
[00:16:23] he's got some of the best wind wait what
[00:16:25] the [ __ ] epitome of a glass Cannon this
[00:16:27] guy's like 10 million P there's [ __ ]
[00:16:29] it's literally viable to go HP HP HP on
[00:16:32] him by the way I don't like that build
[00:16:33] but I recognize that it's not even bad
[00:16:35] you can literally make him super tanky
[00:16:38] he doesn't for the record so common
[00:16:39] misconception when you compare him to
[00:16:41] other characters in other games like
[00:16:42] genin and stuff he doesn't actually deal
[00:16:44] more damage the lower HP he is it's just
[00:16:46] the more HP he consumes so if you
[00:16:48] consume HP and then heal him back up
[00:16:50] right away he still does Max damage true
[00:16:52] okay anyways but they come at a high
[00:16:54] cost namely his health bar while trading
[00:16:56] damage for damage sounds risky it's
[00:16:58] circumvented by the fact that blade
[00:17:00] doesn't start fights he end bro what is
[00:17:02] their UI what the [ __ ] is this as an
[00:17:05] extra precaution his ultimate has a
[00:17:07] built-in fail safe too the ironically
[00:17:09] titled death sentence always restores
[00:17:11] blade to have whether he's above or
[00:17:14] below the threshold then it takes all
[00:17:16] the damage he's taken in the whole match
[00:17:18] and converts it into one explosive
[00:17:20] finishing blow that converts it into one
[00:17:23] explosive finishing blow
[00:17:25] 1481 thanks so much for the subs guys
[00:17:27] let me actually pause a little react to
[00:17:29] this um but Blossom think a 21 vitamin
[00:17:33] think a 21 with that kind of Firepower
[00:17:36] who needs Health anyways I mean blade
[00:17:38] does want blade wants to be healthy he
[00:17:40] just hit he takes number six
[00:17:45] t i
[00:17:48] mean you're play on one time
[00:17:51] speed honestly tun's broken I'm not I'm
[00:17:54] not going to lie I think tun's [ __ ]
[00:17:55] broken but above Fen is a little crazy
[00:17:59] is what it is you get a buff and you get
[00:18:01] a buff that's right T Yun is all about
[00:18:04] those nice powerful attack boosts also
[00:18:06] above blade I think is I think dude okay
[00:18:08] in genin I'm always like pull supports
[00:18:09] over DPSS star I think DPSS actually
[00:18:12] matter a lot more so I think blade
[00:18:13] should actually be higher as well
[00:18:15] talking battery pack for your team and
[00:18:17] with help even lowle heroes clear the
[00:18:20] battlefield what's more tun has one of
[00:18:22] the most useful ultimates in the game in
[00:18:24] that it helps others to get their
[00:18:26] ultimates and yes tenun damage modifiers
[00:18:29] blade S I know blade is my I am a bit
[00:18:31] biased towards
[00:18:33] blade dude I feel like you very easily
[00:18:35] low effort clears most content if you
[00:18:38] just have a good uh a good
[00:18:41] buffer or a good healer or both ideally
[00:18:44] both ultimates equal a must have for
[00:18:47] your team after all if you plan it right
[00:18:49] tingyun can be the buffer that keeps on
[00:18:51] buffing tun's good I
[00:18:55] like number five silver wolf
[00:18:58] number five oh my God five HS quite as
[00:19:02] loud as good oldfashioned debuff enter
[00:19:05] okay wolf she specializes in all of an
[00:19:08] En atast here and we do mean all of them
[00:19:11] defense speed attack you name it
[00:19:14] silverwolf can do it but that's still
[00:19:16] nothing compared to her unique skill
[00:19:18] using allow changes silverwolf gives a
[00:19:20] foe an elemental weakness of one of her
[00:19:22] teammates types no other character in
[00:19:24] the whole game has that kind of mid
[00:19:26] battle versatility it's so flexible that
[00:19:28] honestly silverwolf can slot into just
[00:19:30] about any team composition and still do
[00:19:32] well at this point there's really no
[00:19:34] excuse to leave her
[00:19:41] on I'm angry but let's let's just keep
[00:19:45] going the
[00:19:46] bench I mean I think so here's the thing
[00:19:50] I think silol is really good but I also
[00:19:52] think the characters right before her
[00:19:53] are also broken potentially slightly
[00:19:56] even more broken I don't know how the
[00:19:59] [ __ ] fan is eight I'm I'm or nine sorry
[00:20:01] I'm not getting over that one but I
[00:20:03] think silol is great the only problem
[00:20:05] with Sil is that pail exists and is AOE
[00:20:08] rest rting but silver is really good so
[00:20:10] I like
[00:20:13] silver number four BR is a win fighter
[00:20:18] following harms her comps to vict in the
[00:20:21] name of yes br's broken Ron May came out
[00:20:25] and now Ron May is broken but B is
[00:20:27] broken her Banner of command's very
[00:20:30] broken I'm curious to see who they put
[00:20:32] above when's actual turn comes around
[00:20:35] she takes that idea to a whole new level
[00:20:37] we're talking about dispelling debuffs
[00:20:39] ining the whole team's damage output and
[00:20:41] more and if that's not enough whichever
[00:20:43] Ally BR targets immediately gets another
[00:20:45] turn true it's obvious that who's won
[00:20:47] bro I'm trying to see who's I'm trying
[00:20:49] to see who's eight positions above fan
[00:20:52] and four above r or three above R
[00:20:54] control the flow of the entire game Al
[00:20:56] together to guard and defend crush
[00:21:01] them number three I think J is cracked
[00:21:04] okay
[00:21:05] I wait so is it just Lua huo jingu it's
[00:21:09] probably going to be that right three
[00:21:11] weeks ago it has to be it's gonna be Lua
[00:21:13] huo
[00:21:15] jingu am I right [ __ ] it I don't even
[00:21:17] want to listen to them number two
[00:21:20] jinglu the inner self is purged ever
[00:21:23] since her release jinglu has frozen her
[00:21:25] way at the okay jinglu is cracked by the
[00:21:27] way really really crack DPS
[00:21:30] but how is why is his name laa how is
[00:21:34] Lua eight POS how's he how's he how's he
[00:21:38] that far from
[00:21:40] fushen fushan is nine lra is
[00:21:45] three
[00:21:47] o what Lua gives that is nice is no
[00:21:50] skill point needed to heal your team
[00:21:51] very low effort I play him blade BR Auto
[00:21:54] Battle three star Three Man team clear
[00:21:57] any content in the game but fuan what
[00:21:58] she does is give you sustainability like
[00:22:01] the same sustain healing your party
[00:22:03] tanking damage for you
[00:22:05] and gives you crit rate which usually is
[00:22:09] a better offensive buff than nothing but
[00:22:11] the skill point efficiency from lra is
[00:22:12] nice and he's easy to cringe uh
[00:22:17] cleanse like his by easy to cleanse I
[00:22:20] mean like you just cleanse without a
[00:22:21] skill point and then you could also
[00:22:22] skill if you're panicking the inner self
[00:22:24] is purged ever since her release jinglu
[00:22:27] has frozen her way at
[00:22:29] the and for good reason with or without
[00:22:32] investment her ice damage is simply
[00:22:34] unmatched especially when you take into
[00:22:36] a counter signature Talent Crescent
[00:22:37] transmigration oh yeah oh my God what if
[00:22:40] they put inber Lun two strikes no longer
[00:22:43] needs any skill points to unleash her
[00:22:45] devastating ice
[00:22:46] skills perspective her ultimate can dish
[00:22:49] out over 300 is or is just not here a
[00:22:53] single enemy so word of advice get
[00:22:55] jinglu while you can there may never
[00:22:57] never be a character as strong as her in
[00:22:59] a very very long
[00:23:02] time and so I wield my blade to the very
[00:23:06] end until the stars have been cut down
[00:23:09] from the
[00:23:10] sky before we continue be sure to
[00:23:13] subscribe to our channel ring the bell
[00:23:15] to get notified about our latest videos
[00:23:17] you have the option to be notified for
[00:23:19] occasional videos or all of them if
[00:23:21] you're on your if in I'm going to say it
[00:23:23] before it gets there if inor Lun is
[00:23:25] number one they're from the future when
[00:23:26] we're getting a support that gives you
[00:23:28] five skill points for free you press the
[00:23:30] alt it gives you crit damage based on
[00:23:33] how many skill points you consume per
[00:23:35] turn and then it refunds those skill
[00:23:36] points they're literally predicting the
[00:23:39] skill point giving support where Ider
[00:23:41] Lune will be the best character in the
[00:23:43] game Watch I called it it's
[00:23:45] true consequences this is from the
[00:23:48] future where he becomes number one he's
[00:23:50] still good right now but he's not quite
[00:23:52] number one obviously but this is from
[00:23:54] the future if you're looking for damage
[00:23:57] you're in the right place place as its
[00:23:58] name implies the embi Lun form
[00:24:03] is I think regardless of the DPS stuff
[00:24:07] although I think Jing isn't jinglu
[00:24:08] better right now um but regardless of
[00:24:11] the DPS stuff I think bronia being four
[00:24:13] is way too low I think lra being eight
[00:24:15] [ __ ] tiers above fuan is way too is
[00:24:18] not okay uh I love lra by the way but I
[00:24:20] don't think they should be that far
[00:24:21] apart that if anything fuan is a bit
[00:24:23] higher even though I like lra more for
[00:24:25] Comfort but I mean it depends
[00:24:29] um it's E2 wait why would this be E2 how
[00:24:33] would you know do they say this with
[00:24:34] idolon I don't know but

[00:27:58] all players should be aware that the
[00:28:01] primary way genin impact makes money is
[00:28:03] through
[00:28:04] microtransactions the company will try
[00:28:06] as much as it can to tease you into
[00:28:08] spending just a few dollars on the off
[00:28:11] chance why character you like so when
[00:28:14] you're booting up a new account it's
[00:28:16] essential to know who you can get for
[00:28:18] free after you are introduced to monstad
[00:28:21] make sure you speed through those first
[00:28:23] few story quests to get Amber Ka and
[00:28:26] Lisa added to The Traveler team while
[00:28:29] they are free that doesn't necessarily
[00:28:31] mean they are bad with Kaa in particular
[00:28:34] to be a valid DPS early on but that's
[00:28:37] not all an efficient Hydro healer
[00:28:39] Barbara can be unlocked after reaching
[00:28:42] Adventure rank
[00:28:47] 18 no no no this guy did not just charge
[00:28:51] attack Hydro slimes with Barbara
[00:28:53] Adventure rank 18 and completing the
[00:28:56] aong shot Quest jangling a serious pyro
[00:29:00] DPS character also be unlocked after
[00:29:03] reaching Adventure rank 20 and
[00:29:04] completing floor three of chamber three
[00:29:07] of the Spiral Abyss also while Noel
[00:29:10] isn't necessarily free she is the most
[00:29:13] straightforward guaranteed character to
[00:29:15] get on a wish you should get enough
[00:29:17] aquent Fates to use on The Beginner's
[00:29:19] wish B what the [ __ ] is an aent fate
[00:29:23] between freebies and Quest rewards
[00:29:25] automatically unlocking this fourstar
[00:29:28] geot
[00:29:33] tank number nine consider rolling your
[00:29:37] account wait how many preos was that
[00:29:39] wasn't that like 20K oh consider rolling
[00:29:42] your account I did I actually on my
[00:29:45] generous enough to provide you with 10
[00:29:47] wishes to spend on some of their
[00:29:49] illustrious banners once dude you us to
[00:29:51] get like 60 wishes like 40 to 60 when I
[00:29:55] characters without spending a dime
[00:29:57] furthermore since you get access to them
[00:30:00] it took me minutes starting over again
[00:30:02] is not as I did it in my law classes
[00:30:04] first you have to get past Adventure
[00:30:06] rank seven which takes less than an hour
[00:30:08] playing then you spend those free wishes
[00:30:11] on each new account until you eventually
[00:30:13] get those fantastic fstar pools that
[00:30:15] will likely carry you in the late game
[00:30:18] if this sounds like cheating these five
[00:30:20] star pools that will likely carry you in
[00:30:22] the late game five star pools that will
[00:30:24] likely carry you in the late game this
[00:30:26] sounds like cheating a casino machine
[00:30:29] it's because that's exactly what we're
[00:30:33] doing bro this guy rolls for how kns to
[00:30:36] waste your currency Jong Le excels in
[00:30:38] manipulating Geo able to create and
[00:30:41] absorb geom matter genion impact has
[00:30:44] some notoriously low drop rates compared
[00:30:46] to other gacha games so wait
[00:30:50] really is that even true okay I'm I'm
[00:30:53] not a gacha player I don't even like
[00:30:54] gacha but is it true I thought they were
[00:30:57] better better than most gachas not to be
[00:30:58] a Goa I'm not a gacha Defender I don't
[00:31:00] like gacha in general but I thought it
[00:31:02] was better than most ones or like
[00:31:05] standard-ish it's
[00:31:08] worse I think it's just the pity isn't
[00:31:10] it I think it's worse race but better
[00:31:12] pity or some [ __ ] I don't
[00:31:15] know it's important to know when and how
[00:31:18] to spend much hard collect five stars I
[00:31:20] see the main place you will spend your
[00:31:22] in-game currency is on the four or more
[00:31:25] banners I know my dude my brother okay
[00:31:27] not to get off topic my brother's like
[00:31:29] addicted to mobile Legends and when he
[00:31:31] wants like a skin it's like minus
[00:31:34] 300 the feature he's like please take a
[00:31:36] sponsor from them I'm like no the last
[00:31:39] three are always on rotation offering
[00:31:41] different rewards he's like challenger
[00:31:43] but while you might be tempted to spend
[00:31:45] on the standard and weapon banners don't
[00:31:49] most of the stuff on offer there often
[00:31:50] could be found in the featured one the
[00:31:53] only reason you might want to wish on
[00:31:54] the beginner Banner is if you want a
[00:31:56] guarant
[00:31:57] Noel but there are far more powerful
[00:32:00] characters out there like the gearon
[00:32:02] Jang Lee if you plan to roll your
[00:32:05] account focus on those featured if your
[00:32:08] favorite character doesn't happen to be
[00:32:10] this this even a bad tip yeah roll sure
[00:32:13] quests but did you know there is another
[00:32:15] underappreciated system that more people
[00:32:18] should take advantage reput after
[00:32:20] reaching Adventure rank bro you get like
[00:32:22] 60k MOA how is that going to save you
[00:32:24] from spending money and clearing several
[00:32:26] of the main quests in monat leaway and
[00:32:29] inauma you'll eventually unlock a genin
[00:32:32] impacts reputation system after this
[00:32:35] what's even better is that you can get a
[00:32:37] region specific cosmetic glider for your
[00:32:40] characters one of the few you can get
[00:32:43] for
[00:32:44] [Music]
[00:32:45] free number six saving your frag resins
[00:32:49] there are a lot of different items in
[00:32:51] genin Impact so it can be pretty your 60
[00:32:55] resin something typically reserved for
[00:32:57] spending Primo gems gen in game how I
[00:33:00] get a strong account without spending
[00:33:01] money [ __ ]
[00:33:03] it hey everyone Mt here and after
[00:33:07] building multiple accounts I've got like
[00:33:09] three accounts that are fully ar45 and
[00:33:12] like really far into the game and then
[00:33:13] I've got one more account that I'm still
[00:33:15] leveling up Chad back off the go I have
[00:33:17] played through the game a lot and I have
[00:33:19] found out a constant and and that is
[00:33:22] that Primo gems are kind of finite to an
[00:33:26] extent right there's only so
[00:33:28] many do to get Primo gems and there's
[00:33:31] only so many okay I'm actually bored uh
[00:33:34] we'll probably play the game I wanted to
[00:33:35] watch this but it's 2 years
[00:33:38] old do you think it's that outdated
[00:33:40] there's no way this video is that
[00:33:41] outdated what if I skip
[00:33:44] here on your oh my God
[00:33:47] duuke okay okay okay [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ]
[00:33:51] [ __ ] okay maybe not
[00:33:55] um
[00:33:57] [Music]
[00:34:01] number nine Raiden Shogun I meany that's
[00:34:05] actually not even a bad take and SE a
[00:34:08] world for two years ago ryen is pretty
[00:34:11] good given that several playable
[00:34:13] characters I don't know n is probably
[00:34:15] low unless they includes supports like
[00:34:16] unless it's like Bennett SRO Shang Ling
[00:34:18] you won't be surprised there are
[00:34:20] aist Raiden Shogun is the of be elel the
[00:34:24] Electro archon and God of
[00:34:28] yeah there's no way she's numbered n two
[00:34:29] years ago though that's actually no not
[00:34:31] even
[00:34:32] possible [ __ ] it I'm watching this this
[00:34:35] is the best part about having memory
[00:34:36] loss is that you oh spoilers I didn't
[00:34:39] mean to click there is that you can
[00:34:40] rewatch things cuz you forget
[00:34:42] Sally badass with a high energy recharge
[00:34:46] rate passive Electro damage and some
[00:34:49] excellent inum Shin
[00:34:52] Eternal did they just do
[00:34:55] 29k but I guess is the trial okay I'm
[00:34:57] not going to Flame them it's a trial
[00:34:59] it's a trial I'm not going to Flame them
[00:35:00] but that is disgustingly bad but I'm not
[00:35:02] going to
[00:35:04] Flame Raiden greatly increases energy
[00:35:07] regen and Elemental burst damage for the
[00:35:09] whole group dude what is this Yeehaw ass
[00:35:11] music listen right Raiden fills a slot
[00:35:14] on many teams
[00:35:20] [Music]
[00:35:22] nicely number eight Xiao Xiao is a name
[00:35:26] seldom heard and as the few who have
[00:35:28] seen him can attest he
[00:35:30] appears danger is n the adep ey are a
[00:35:33] group of like something hear in a Kinder

[00:35:58] plunging at enemies from the sky you
[00:36:00] have to watch that HP [ __ ] music dud
[00:36:02] to boost his output while he might
[00:36:04] seclude himself from the general public
[00:36:06] he isn't shy when kicking ass honestly

[00:36:12] battle danger follows there's no way
[00:36:14] before far on yeah he shouldn't Ryden
[00:36:17] should has to be way higher but at least
[00:36:19] he's above to avoid Haring others he
[00:36:21] acts quickly completing the task at hand
[00:36:24] as efficiently as possible number seven
[00:36:28] AA when you strike quick as Lightning is
[00:36:32] this DPSS or is it like supports as well
[00:36:34] cuz if it's DPS is Ryden and aaka should
[00:36:36] have been higher even Shia two years ago
[00:36:38] I'm not I'm not even I'm not even biased
[00:36:40] by the way but if it includes supports
[00:36:42] then that's [ __ ] to our list as an
[00:36:44] excellent cryo sword fighter with a high
[00:36:46] Bas crit damage rate and passive attack
[00:36:48] Buffs unleash you have to remember that
[00:36:50] this time in the
[00:36:52] abyss usually it was AOE this is when
[00:36:54] they started adding bosses
[00:37:01] as you scale
[00:37:02] her levs one and drastically increases
[00:37:06] her destructive output making her easily
[00:37:08] one of the best ice Fighters out there
[00:37:11] good support hero always advised with
[00:37:13] these Heavy Hitters once you can
[00:37:15] properly manage your stamina and
[00:37:17] elementales a trump card worthy of her
[00:37:20] Legacy
[00:37:22] oh too hard oh it seems I still have
[00:37:26] prove sorry number six venty wait okay
[00:37:31] venty was actually good back then but
[00:37:33] but what what the [ __ ] is this is this
[00:37:34] supports as well is he a DP what's
[00:37:36] happening which traveled among the
[00:37:39] gods that of which beheld lands undone
[00:37:42] Seas
[00:37:43] spun while they might be a free-spirited
[00:37:46] Bard with a love of the local taverns
[00:37:48] venty is easily one of the strongest
[00:37:51] range venty was the best DPS in 1.0 that
[00:37:53] is true the god of the wind element
[00:37:55] venty is a sponge for energy recharging
[00:37:58] but this was post Ena Zuma I'm pretty
[00:38:00] sure a lot of enemies still could be
[00:38:01] displaced
[00:38:06] but as a result you'll be dealing out
[00:38:09] vast clumps of AOE damage he's really
[00:38:10] good for casual play though like stuff
[00:38:12] like this you just ven Skyward and wind
[00:38:16] rider make the player very mobile
[00:38:19] meaning bailing out of dangerous
[00:38:20] situations is a breeze you'll be
[00:38:23] scooping up energy dealing out damage
[00:38:25] while remaining as light as a feather
[00:38:27] with this a banger
[00:38:29] [Music]
[00:38:33] music number five
[00:38:36] kazua last
[00:38:38] one why is he number
[00:38:41] five they're going to oh I remember
[00:38:43] they're going to put godu above kazua oh
[00:38:45] my God kill me oh my God kill me if
[00:38:48] there is one wandering Samurai to have
[00:38:50] on your team kidar kazua certainly
[00:38:53] slices through the competition while V
[00:38:56] dude what is this music the wind archon
[00:38:59] kazua crept up and usurped him as the
[00:39:01] most desirable damage dealing air
[00:39:03] element party member stop saying air
[00:39:07] element you're fighting Animo slimes if
[00:39:09] you press
[00:39:11] e he can basically do what venty can but
[00:39:14] more affordably efficiently controlling
[00:39:16] crowds with his spammable Elemental
[00:39:18] skill on top of practically being a
[00:39:20] battery for energy recharge his passive
[00:39:23] swirl damage as a sub DPS also makes him
[00:39:26] an excellent support character so when
[00:39:28] you're trying to maximize damage on a
[00:39:30] DPS team what is this rotation always be
[00:39:33] a strong
[00:39:34] Contender okay who's going to be right
[00:39:36] about kazwa if they say like Bennett you
[00:39:39] can argue Nikita Nita wasn't out SRO
[00:39:43] maybe I'll listen to
[00:39:46] you number four Jong
[00:39:49] Lee this is an age of God I
[00:39:52] mean I wish not for Dominion yet I
[00:39:55] cannot watch the common folk suffer it's
[00:39:57] honestly the game later updates hit the
[00:40:00] I assume element saw one of the most
[00:40:02] that the target audience of this video
[00:40:04] no disrespect by the way can't really
[00:40:07] Dodge and if you can't Dodge then J Le
[00:40:09] is the best character in the game and of
[00:40:11] course what other Geo user would you
[00:40:13] pick to have in your party than the
[00:40:15] vessel for the Geo archon himself Jong
[00:40:18] Lee use the elemental Shield created by
[00:40:21] crystallize you can't argue with J Le
[00:40:24] true but [ __ ] it I'm going to anyways
[00:40:27] Ryden is number nine and I think the
[00:40:30] archon tier list get mad at me if you
[00:40:32] want I don't give a [ __ ] archon tier
[00:40:33] list Nikita then farzon what the
[00:40:38] [ __ ] Nikita then well that's true by the
[00:40:41] way Nikita then Fara then Ryden Jong Lee
[00:40:44] and then venti Jong Lee could be above
[00:40:47] Ryden sometimes if you're like skill
[00:40:48] issue and you need it but for the most
[00:40:49] part I think Ryden is more valuable
[00:40:52] while he might it depends depends on
[00:40:53] your team relatively low regular attack
[00:40:55] numbers you won't be short on Geo to
[00:40:57] deal out his excellent stackable skills
[00:41:00] petrifying enemies with his Elemental
[00:41:02] burst while creating Shields to buff
[00:41:04] your HP plus draining Elemental energy
[00:41:07] off his enemies so he can repeatedly
[00:41:09] damage over a huge area what draining
[00:41:12] energy off his enemies did he say that
[00:41:14] survived while he might have some
[00:41:16] relatively low regular attack won't be
[00:41:19] short on Geo to deal out his excellent
[00:41:22] stackable skills petrifying stackable
[00:41:25] skills first wait why does my le skill
[00:41:28] stack Shields to buff your HP plus
[00:41:30] draining Elemental energy off his enemy
[00:41:33] he drains energy can repeatedly damage
[00:41:35] over a hug area damn jungly what other
[00:41:39] tricks are you hiding in that long coat
[00:41:41] I didn't know he drained
[00:41:42] energy that's
[00:41:47] sick number three Hut come with me I'm
[00:41:52] honestly based [ __ ] it I don't care yeah
[00:41:54] sure let me help you cross over as the I
[00:41:57] don't care feral I mean she shouldn't be
[00:41:59] above Kaza but [ __ ] it woman to put
[00:42:03] people on the ground but given she's one
[00:42:05] of the most potent pyro characters it's
[00:42:08] more like she's cremating her enemies
[00:42:10] her character is entirely focused on
[00:42:13] those High destruction numbers making
[00:42:15] her one of the most I mean I don't even
[00:42:17] think she's above changling let alone
[00:42:19] Kaza but I like cow so I think she
[00:42:21] should be somewhere on the list this is
[00:42:25] from they're crediting look you know me
[00:42:28] I'm a Tony toe fan but they're crediting
[00:42:31] Tony toe which means it's a C6 R5
[00:42:33] they're
[00:42:34] showing 33k crit never
[00:42:37] mind what she lacks in diverse area of
[00:42:41] AFF abilities she makes up for with her
[00:42:43] stupidly lofty damage but you have to be
[00:42:46] careful as her Elemental skill drains
[00:42:48] her HP to deal out those big numbers
[00:42:51] imagine being so powerful that you have
[00:42:53] to be careful not to destroy yourself
[00:42:56] adventurers are our VIP clients after
[00:42:59] all we even have coupons for you yes two
[00:43:05] YULA okay what did I just do oh I hit my
[00:43:10] keyboard I'm sorry yo I'm sorry what
[00:43:13] happened
[00:43:16] okay y man if you're watching no
[00:43:19] disrespect okay no disrespect I love her
[00:43:22] look at her visually stunning appealing
[00:43:25] listen
[00:43:27] they put YULA above I'm just going to
[00:43:28] name the characters that they put as
[00:43:31] worse than YULA
[00:43:33] Hut kazua Ryden Jong Lee venti
[00:43:42] Shia and deluke but that one's deser
[00:43:48] aaka Ryden is the worst stop coping this
[00:43:51] has to be bait no I'm about to unleash
[00:43:53] my Elemental burst on you you better be
[00:43:55] baiting you you better be baiting you
[00:43:57] better be bait oh my God this might not
[00:43:58] be
[00:43:59] bait Hut is better here fob hit for one
[00:44:02] minut listen here listen here there is
[00:44:05] no
[00:44:09] way there is no
[00:44:11] way I'm going to calm
[00:44:16] [Music]
[00:44:21] down I'm not going to lie my memory loss
[00:44:24] I uh kicked in hard and I forgot who you
[00:44:26] were saying YULA was better then Ryden
[00:44:29] Shogun Not only was good when she was
[00:44:31] you know pretty strong when she came out
[00:44:33] but now got even better and has access
[00:44:35] to a plethora of teams not only can she
[00:44:38] be used with many characters on field as
[00:44:41] an electro driver such as a national
[00:44:43] Shang Ling Singo Bennett team or yolan
[00:44:46] or finina instead of Singo but she can
[00:44:48] also be used as a hyper carry even
[00:44:50] better with C2 even better with
[00:44:52] engulfing but even without it can be
[00:44:53] fine with Bennett maybe Chev Maybe Sara
[00:44:56] maybe kazwa maybe mix and match and she
[00:44:59] now can also be used as a hyper Bloom
[00:45:01] Electro the best offensive option in
[00:45:03] that team yeah normally I would
[00:45:05] recommend Ki as a Healer but riding can
[00:45:07] even be better because if you don't need
[00:45:08] the healing it's more Electro
[00:45:09] application from off field all you need
[00:45:11] to do is press your skill boom uh very
[00:45:13] valuable
[00:45:17] character YULA did get better with
[00:45:19] finina however but this video is preina
[00:45:21] so I'm not going to
[00:45:24] yeah before we unveil our top pick here
[00:45:28] are a few honorable mentions you better
[00:45:31] not say Bennett you [ __ ] I am giving you
[00:45:33] the benefit of the doubt that Bennett's
[00:45:35] not in the video I am being generous
[00:45:37] here and saying you know what this is
[00:45:38] about like five stars okay it's about
[00:45:40] five stars if you honorable mention
[00:45:42] Bennett I will punch something
[00:45:47] Benn buff makes Bennett a solid addition
[00:45:50] I
[00:45:53] team whatever maybe honorable mentions
[00:45:55] are four
[00:45:57] stars true child switching between melee
[00:46:01] and ranged is very satisfying as a that
[00:46:04] is not the reason why he's good
[00:46:06] switching between melee and range should
[00:46:08] not be how you play him you should not
[00:46:10] play him as ranged but you know what
[00:46:12] sure child is
[00:46:14] good especially at the time of this
[00:46:16] video child very good Char the attack
[00:46:20] there as many Hydra options that deals
[00:46:22] increased damage Mona easily covers the
[00:46:26] battlefield with Hydro damage and status
[00:46:28] effects she Masters the battlefield with
[00:46:31] ease controlling the situation and
[00:46:34] creating openings for her teammates to
[00:46:36] attack before we continue be sure to

[00:46:54] ganu
[00:46:57] sweet flower soall because of its high
[00:47:00] sugar content while she might serve as
[00:47:03] an amary for the Leo Ching she might as
[00:47:06] well be the queen of ice I'm not going
[00:47:09] to be a hindsight Harry because there
[00:47:10] was a time where G was considered the
[00:47:12] best
[00:47:13] DPS the cocoa goat right especially when
[00:47:17] ventti was strong you could ventti Mona
[00:47:19] G use all their bursts and it was great
[00:47:22] melt also pretty good but G with venti
[00:47:26] was typically the queen of
[00:47:28] ice
[00:47:31] however someone said fob made that video
[00:47:34] no he didn't even at that time would she
[00:47:37] be above
[00:47:39] kazwa she might serve as an emissary for
[00:47:42] the Leo Chi Shing she might as well be
[00:47:45] the queen of ice while she might sport
[00:47:48] some low HP utilizing her distance as a
[00:47:51] bow user means that won't be much to
[00:47:53] worry about December 23rd 2021 I
[00:47:56] actually want to I want to [ __ ] it full
[00:47:58] context I want to see exactly what I was
[00:48:01] uploading at that exact date just to
[00:48:03] like put myself in that mindset Zio I'm
[00:48:06] just going to look up my own channel
[00:48:07] [ __ ] it from her damage with charged
[00:48:11] attacks alone sometimes reaching six
[00:48:13] digits in quick succession if
[00:48:15] appropriately
[00:48:19] stacked
[00:48:22] wow plus her skill and Elemental burst
[00:48:25] are nothing to laugh at allowing for
[00:48:27] excellent crowd control all this
[00:48:29] combines into an incredibly flexible
[00:48:31] character making her the most valuable
[00:48:33] DPS character you could have on your
[00:48:38] [Music]
[00:48:40] team well how long ago is
[00:48:42] this in the mood for more awesome gaming
[00:48:45] content be sure to check out this video
[00:48:47] here this is 2.1 and don't forget to

[00:48:52] in 2.0 oh oh what I just click on oh my
[00:48:54] God
[00:48:58] the [ __ ] is
[00:49:06] this wait wait wait when was this when
[00:49:08] was this August wait this is like five
[00:49:10] months earlier did I put G here I
[00:49:12] probably
[00:49:18] did
[00:49:22] hello want to talk about the best
[00:49:24] characters in p
[00:49:27] 2.0 rate and some Crow damage bonus the
[00:49:30] ridiculous scaling on her Elemental true
[00:49:32] dude FR is so good back then true that
[00:49:35] are really strong Kaza is bro bro I'm
[00:49:37] playing I'm literally playing National
[00:49:39] Kaza they have no excuse I'm literally
[00:49:42] playing National with
[00:49:43] kazwa exceptional in patch 2.0 because
[00:49:46] of everything he offers to your team not
[00:49:49] only is he a great anemo unit which
[00:49:50] means you can run the Verdes and vener
[00:49:52] set to increase your team's overall
[00:49:53] damage by reducing the resistance of of
[00:49:55] opponents but he also shines at grouping
[00:49:57] enemies as you can see with his
[00:49:58] Elemental true this was this was the
[00:50:00] first coo Banner them up which is very
[00:50:03] important to deal AOE damage and to said
[00:50:05] don't P for Kazo if you have V on Kazo
[00:50:07] first B dude honestly I'm pretty sure I
[00:50:10] also I'm pretty sure I said he's good
[00:50:12] but not like a needed pull like I think
[00:50:13] I underrated him a bit but even back
[00:50:15] then the take was like you he's just V
[00:50:18] when cuz I remember ventti was broken
[00:50:19] when he came out and the take was just
[00:50:20] well he's a second veny so run them
[00:50:22] together with
[00:50:23] Bennett I remember that I remember the
[00:50:25] day speci abili we played bet ventti
[00:50:27] Kazo is actually pretty good you know
[00:50:28] fou or the miror maiden and that's not
[00:50:31] all Kaza also brings an insane amount
[00:50:33] wait who's here a lot better recently
[00:50:35] and someone who's honestly still
[00:50:37] underrated and that character is
[00:50:40] sucros my goat my goat my goat still
[00:50:44] underrated by the way this was made over
[00:50:46] two years ago still underrated by the
[00:50:47] way is an excellent forar and since
[00:50:50] she's a Nemo much like kazwa she can
[00:50:53] that provide you with a lot of utility
[00:50:54] and a very power I agree to prevent you
[00:50:56] from dying if I don't know what the [ __ ]
[00:50:58] this team comp is though these two
[00:51:00] characters are obviously is bro playing
[00:51:02] why I'm talking about these characters
[00:51:03] together is because they fill a similar
[00:51:05] role now keep in mind ji is a better
[00:51:07] unit because of everything he provides
[00:51:08] right an amazing Shield resistance shred
[00:51:10] on amazing oh I talking about Shields
[00:51:13] and general so too okay fair vaping true
[00:51:15] Hut true her damage is just objectively
[00:51:19] one of the highest in the game she's an
[00:51:20] excellent carry great at AOE damage and
[00:51:22] shines exceptionally well once you have
[00:51:24] her constellation 4 and as you can see
[00:51:26] even in a single Target situation like
[00:51:27] against a maguk keni while this is
[00:51:29] probably her weakest situation since
[00:51:31] usually you want her Pyon to hit
[00:51:33] multiple enemies at once even against a
[00:51:35] single Target she can still clear it
[00:51:37] very fast and do very well honestly
[00:51:39] while you can usually amount of damage
[00:51:41] I'll put some numbers on screen showing
[00:51:43] exactly true bet my goat okay anyways
[00:51:45] that's all um that's all I'm sorry for
[00:51:47] getting distracted but B is my goat for
[00:51:49] the record for those of you who don't
[00:51:51] know see it is ridiculous hasard second
[00:51:54] constellation is that 12,000 scaling
[00:51:56] yeah yeah it is against exactly two
[00:51:58] enemies can even be higher than ula's
[00:52:00] damage just from her bur alone and on
[00:52:03] top of that soed child child is a great
[00:52:06] enabler for both of those off field
[00:52:08] carries because he applies Hydro
[00:52:09] extremely fast true but who can
[00:52:12] especially abuse the current floor 12 by
[00:52:14] getting an insane amount of particles
[00:52:15] during high tide and then using their
[00:52:17] burst during all of oh my God high tide
[00:52:19] oh my God high tide low tide I'm going
[00:52:22] to scream of all enemies around him dude
[00:52:24] give me more abysses like this look at
[00:52:26] how broken sh's in this Abyss dude
[00:52:28] imagine we get abysses where they
[00:52:30] actually group enemies oh my God
[00:52:32] Consolidated AOE damage with all of his
[00:52:35] plunges being able to hit a wide range
[00:52:37] around him being an amazing carry to use
[00:52:39] at basically any stage of the game
[00:52:41] especially if you can build a team
[00:52:42] around him chia's main weakness although
[00:52:44] it is usually overe exaggerated is the
[00:52:46] fact that he needs a battery or another
[00:52:47] anemo character to generate particles
[00:52:49] for him with characters
[00:52:51] like and her burst actually oh my God I
[00:52:53] mentioned YULA okay maybe I wasn't based
[00:52:56] wait what did I say now and who can be
[00:52:57] one of the strongest units to speedrun
[00:52:59] at high investment or even with
[00:53:01] constellations I mainly wanted to
[00:53:02] mention her because she is a good carry
[00:53:04] and because as I mentioned she's able to
[00:53:06] take advantage of the floor 12 lay line
[00:53:08] very efficiently I me a character who
[00:53:10] really wants a lot of investment and her
[00:53:11] burst actually similarly to AA can like
[00:53:14] Miss sometimes or can be a bit janky but
[00:53:16] when it does hit the scaling on okay at
[00:53:18] least I acknowledge that on cool down
[00:53:19] and dish out massive amounts of damage
[00:53:21] when you crit can be devastating for
[00:53:22] clearing any piece of content very
[00:53:24] rapidly the next character I want to
[00:53:25] talk about okay I just kind of yapped
[00:53:27] what is the most rep played
[00:53:30] part the talk about Bennett and singu
[00:53:32] singu did get e why did I pronounce it
[00:53:34] like that in this patch by getting the
[00:53:36] new emblem set which is amazing on him
[00:53:38] since it gives you energy recharge and
[00:53:39] damage but just in general Ben dude
[00:53:41] these [ __ ] release emblem in a floor
[00:53:43] where you don't need energy like the
[00:53:45] floor 12 was on oh my dude high tide low
[00:53:48] tide was actually like a war crime have
[00:53:51] always been amazing supports benett by
[00:53:53] giving you an insane amount of damage
[00:53:55] healing you bro isn't aren't Yia players
[00:53:58] still trying to convince us how much
[00:54:00] better Vape is I we've been playing this
[00:54:02] team it's been I've been playing this
[00:54:03] team this team was played two years ago
[00:54:05] how is this not like is this still is
[00:54:08] this still an argu I feel like people
[00:54:09] are still talking about think true have
[00:54:11] always this is literally a year ago
[00:54:13] amazing supports two sorry two giving
[00:54:16] you an insane amount of damage healing
[00:54:18] you giving you pyr particles and sing
[00:54:19] Chu for dealing insane amounts of damage
[00:54:21] with his rain swords and constantly
[00:54:23] applying Hydro enabling reactions now I
[00:54:25] wanted to mention these two briefly
[00:54:26] because they are both amazing but
[00:54:28] they've always been amazing and I'm sure
[00:54:29] you guys have heard this multiple okay
[00:54:31] anyways I'm going to stop
[00:54:33] yapping I still play VAP I mean I'm
[00:54:36] pretty sure it's like your best team
[00:54:37] isn't
[00:54:38] it okay maybe maybe maybe overload with
[00:54:42] Chev we'll
[00:54:46] see
[00:54:52] no okay it's not by the way I recorded
[00:54:55] my chevos guide I re-recorded my play
[00:54:58] style section five [ __ ] times also I
[00:55:01] saw people get mad at me for calling her
[00:55:03] Neu like listen that was just me going
[00:55:06] through her skills very fast and it was
[00:55:08] based the only thing is if if to you
[00:55:10] listen Okay I hate people that get mad
[00:55:12] at stuff like that listen okay yes she
[00:55:15] doesn't buff your reaction damage don't
[00:55:16] stack em on your characters because she
[00:55:18] doesn't buff overload she Buffs your
[00:55:20] pyro and your Electro characters her
[00:55:22] team restrictions are like nuu where you
[00:55:24] only want pyro Electro you can run a
[00:55:26] Nemo you can run other [ __ ] like how nuu
[00:55:28] only wants Hydro dendro but Neu Buffs
[00:55:30] Bloom uh Shu doesn't buff Blom it
[00:55:33] doesn't buff overload she Buffs your
[00:55:35] characters after you overload it's not
[00:55:37] the same in my guide I don't call her
[00:55:39] that so don't worry but I'm just saying
[00:55:41] when I talk on stream I say stuff words
[00:55:44] okay and then they get taken because
[00:55:46] it's words but for the for the record
[00:55:48] she just Buffs pyro Electro that's what
[00:55:50] she does I've seen some weird uh uh uh
[00:55:54] C6 TC where you could ignore that
[00:55:57] passive and then use her for her C6 and
[00:55:59] her attack buff in a team that runs like
[00:56:02] anemo character but I don't want to talk
[00:56:04] about that and if you talk about that I
[00:56:05] don't want to talk to you um but for the
[00:56:08] most part shur seems pretty good I
[00:56:10] actually like her uh the thing I've been
[00:56:13] okay everyone I talk to everywhere I
[00:56:16] look everyone I Yap at says yeah just go
[00:56:19] HP CH healer CH I and and me I was like
[00:56:22] dude I know that's the the the best
[00:56:24] build right I know you go healer but
[00:56:26] what if we experiment with damage built
[00:56:29] and I was like listen I went down a
[00:56:31] rabbit hole and this Rabbit Hole cost me
[00:56:34] potentially years of my life okay I went
[00:56:37] down the rabbit hole
[00:56:41] and I went down the rabbit
[00:56:44] hole and what ended up happening through
[00:56:47] these
[00:56:48] simulations shout out to someone I don't
[00:56:50] know if I can even shout out but shout
[00:56:53] out and through the the process of great
[00:56:59] thinking listen 99% of the time Shor is
[00:57:03] going to be HP
[00:57:05] build stack your passive I was doing all
[00:57:08] this in the trial by the way this none
[00:57:09] of this is like oh sus oh Suk oh Suk
[00:57:13] it's literally oh my
[00:57:20] god
[00:57:23] look um
[00:57:29] can I show her [ __ ] skill
[00:57:34] okay this is in game this is not leaks
[00:57:37] this is literally like the trial like
[00:57:39] this is my account you can see the uid
[00:57:41] so her skills damage and her burst
[00:57:44] damage skill on attack whereas her
[00:57:46] healing and her
[00:57:47] buff skills on HP so generally you just
[00:57:52] go HP and then you shut the [ __ ] up and
[00:57:53] it's literally no investment at all no
[00:57:57] investment needed how do you test the
[00:57:58] build we didn't it was simulations on
[00:58:00] math on the G on like a simulator
[00:58:02] website through Excel it's literally
[00:58:04] just mathing that's it there's no like I
[00:58:06] couldn't play her
[00:58:08] however
[00:58:10] however for most
[00:58:13] 99.99999% of people you just go HP you
[00:58:16] shut the [ __ ] up you buff your team you
[00:58:18] go no investment you barely level your
[00:58:20] talents you're chilling but if you're a
[00:58:22] Chev Cheryl if you're a Chevrolet
[00:58:26] Christopher okay
[00:58:29] listen I was theorizing what if you
[00:58:32] actually maximize her damage because her
[00:58:33] scalings are decently high
[00:58:35] now most people might agree they be like
[00:58:38] yeah just go damage the problem is you
[00:58:40] lose out on two things you lose out on
[00:58:43] 20% attack roughly from this passive to
[00:58:45] all of your party members you go from uh
[00:58:49] 20 if you have 20K HP which let's say
[00:58:51] your standard DPS build with like a few
[00:58:53] HP substats would have go from 20K HP to
[00:58:55] 40K HP you buff your team 20% attack
[00:58:58] instead of 40% attack normally you'd be
[00:59:00] like okay that's a lot but if you're
[00:59:02] running Bennett no blast oblig power
[00:59:04] resonance is it really is 20% attack
[00:59:07] really better than all of shu's damage
[00:59:09] and the answer is
[00:59:11] yeah sometimes sometimes it's a bit
[00:59:13] better sometimes it's a bit worse
[00:59:15] depends on your team if you like two
[00:59:16] carries if you're like R and Shang Ling
[00:59:17] then you want to buff both if it's only
[00:59:19] Ryden then maybe not like stuff like
[00:59:21] that
[00:59:23] but also need to understand the
[00:59:25] following
[00:59:26] thing she can run the new song of days
[00:59:29] passet we'll talk about that but it
[00:59:32] basically gives you kind of like Shena
[00:59:34] quills damage buff for your active
[00:59:37] character as you heal which means you
[00:59:38] actually want healing for that and so
[00:59:41] because of that it can actually be a bit
[00:59:44] more team DPS a lot of the time to stack
[00:59:47] HP however it can actually sometimes
[00:59:51] still be better to go damage in specific
[00:59:54] scenario iOS where one you're either not
[00:59:56] farming the domain cuz it's not super
[00:59:57] efficient if you don't want to build
[00:59:59] Navia as well that's one two if you're
[01:00:01] running someone like Bennett already and
[01:00:04] three you're running you have a bit of
[01:00:06] spare time on your bennit field to where
[01:00:07] you can take the buff on chers you might
[01:00:09] not if you're running multiple carries
[01:00:10] let's say you have to go Shang Ling
[01:00:11] fishal ridden well that's three
[01:00:13] characters but you know what I mean you
[01:00:14] have to spend the time on a lot of
[01:00:15] characters especially if it's not ridden
[01:00:16] someone that wants to be on field for a
[01:00:17] long time you might not have time but
[01:00:18] what if you're running right in as a
[01:00:20] hyper carry oh and you don't need a lot
[01:00:22] of energy because you can invest your
[01:00:23] substats offensively so you can like so
[01:00:25] what is the in practice what does that
[01:00:27] look like it looks like Bennett sh Ryden
[01:00:30] if you're running that team Bennett
[01:00:32] already gives you enough healing so
[01:00:33] don't need to build healing he gives you
[01:00:34] a [ __ ] ton of attack where the extra 20%
[01:00:36] attack while it's still relevant isn't
[01:00:38] quite as important and if you're not
[01:00:39] running song of days past then investing
[01:00:41] in her personal damage and getting the
[01:00:43] Buffs from Bennett Circle can
[01:00:45] technically sometimes be about as good
[01:00:47] and sometimes even a little better than
[01:00:48] going for a Healer build now is it worth
[01:00:50] all that investment for potentially a
[01:00:52] little bit higher upside no but shv
[01:00:55] looks good and it makes you actually use
[01:00:57] a fourar and make her deal damage which
[01:00:59] is satisfying and therefore makes
[01:01:01] another build viable and potentially
[01:01:02] optimal especially with constellations
[01:01:04] which is what I was theorizing and now I
[01:01:07] know that I'm not insane however
[01:01:08] counterargument Z are stupid song of
[01:01:11] days past would usually make her better
[01:01:13] in a support build because you go for
[01:01:14] healing you buff your onfield character
[01:01:16] and you gain 20% attack which will end
[01:01:18] up being more damaged than shers
[01:01:20] sometimes if you are using your boss
[01:01:22] efficiently because of this it much
[01:01:24] depends and there isn't really a correct
[01:01:26] answer so usually you just go HP and
[01:01:28] it's low investment and you don't have
[01:01:30] to think but the fact that you can go
[01:01:31] damage and that it's as viable means
[01:01:33] that my guide has to be twice as long
[01:01:35] cuz I'm going to cover both play Styles
[01:01:36] but it also means that someone like me
[01:01:38] someone like
[01:01:40] you I wish can now go for a damage build
[01:01:43] because you can make a character shine
[01:01:45] that otherwise would just be like a a
[01:01:47] full HP Neu who doesn't really do damage
[01:01:49] but bust your team but in this
[01:01:53] instance
[01:01:57] so needless to say I re-recorded um this
[01:02:00] section like six different times
[01:02:03] hopefully I don't have to do it
[01:02:09] anymore but it took me a long time to
[01:02:12] understand that um because everyone was
[01:02:15] saying just go HP and in my mind I was
[01:02:17] like dude there's no way 20% attack is
[01:02:20] always better than the like her scalings
[01:02:23] but what I fail they consider was song
[01:02:25] of days past and and now it's kind of
[01:02:28] like a wow wow so it's like they're both
[01:02:31] fine I think tldr you should still go HP
[01:02:34] for most people it's low investment it's
[01:02:36] easy but I think there's now a scenarios
[01:02:39] Niche scenarios where building her for
[01:02:40] damage can either be a bit better or
[01:02:43] like similar to where it's just viable
[01:02:44] which is cool that's cool that's another
[01:02:47] build that's
[01:02:49] viable I just spilled water on my
[01:02:53] penis can you repeat please you want me
[01:02:56] to say it in
[01:02:58] French 20% attack is easy exactly all
[01:03:01] you need to get the 20% attack is 40k HP
[01:03:03] that's it that's all you need 40K HP
[01:03:06] that's it
[01:03:08] GG huh and why are the butterflies our
[01:03:12] guides well because they want to be cies
[01:03:16] when they grow up welcome to watch
[01:03:20] Mojo do you guys remember Hut's
[01:03:23] trailer I
[01:03:26] remember the best character of each
[01:03:29] element I'm actually not clicking that
[01:03:31] top 10 hardest bosses I'm going to skip
[01:03:33] to the
[01:03:35] middle than it geoc counterpart you must
[01:03:38] be incredibly efficient at extinguishing
[01:03:39] its fire seedss and horrendously
[01:03:42] damaging attacks you can't honestly
[01:03:46] based [ __ ] the
[01:03:49] oceanid while you can use cryo to
[01:03:52] immobilize these minions easily her Prim
[01:03:54] primary form is not to be
[01:03:57] underestimated best thing you can do is
[01:03:59] keep well back and avoid her attacks
[01:04:01] like what I don't think I've ever got
[01:04:03] into that phase what the [ __ ] maybe I
[01:04:06] just didn't know you could do that what
[01:04:08] the [ __ ] is this her attacks like the
[01:04:11] plague which is hard enough to do when
[01:04:13] they cover half of the Arena rodee's
[01:04:15] rage can certainly be raged it was an
[01:04:17] event
[01:04:20] oh
[01:04:21] oh oh my God this was so long
[01:04:25] go okay I was like what the
[01:04:35] [ __ ] dude I was watching this m video
[01:04:38] off stream just for fun on dude I don't
[01:04:40] know why you guys are like like dude
[01:04:42] unironically a homie but anyways I was
[01:04:45] watching it he was like well I was
[01:04:47] playing genin impa listen I want to talk
[01:04:48] about it now if you look at my Ryden
[01:04:51] Shogun right now she's got the guilded
[01:04:52] dreams on and she's got the dragon's
[01:04:55] Bane but previously she was equipped
[01:04:59] with an engulfing lightning all right
[01:05:02] and I was using these artifacts that
[01:05:05] while they might not be perfect and I
[01:05:07] don't know if this I think I might have
[01:05:08] switched a couple around but some of
[01:05:10] these were pretty juicy with the crit
[01:05:12] rate and crit damage they had some
[01:05:14] pretty good stats on them overall and
[01:05:17] running this typically on my ryen shell
[01:05:20] gun I mean I can do 100,000 300,000
[01:05:22] damage crazy amounts I done videos
[01:05:24] showing how hard my Riden shell gun can
[01:05:27] hit my Riden shell gun is also C2 I'm
[01:05:30] one of those crazy guys that that went
[01:05:32] all the way
[01:05:33] baby and when I swapped to hyper Bloom
[01:05:38] and dragon's
[01:05:39] Bane it was easier to clear the content
[01:05:42] so he's saying that going from engulfing
[01:05:44] C2 Ryden to hyper blo made the game
[01:05:47] easier for him and he goes to elaborate
[01:05:49] this is out of context he goes to
[01:05:50] elaborate it helps with elemental checks
[01:05:52] certain enemies and a lot of different
[01:05:54] stuff now I honestly understand that
[01:05:57] take but clearly he didn't see the same
[01:05:59] video that I saw about how hyper blo is
[01:06:01] not good and shouldn't be used
[01:06:03] especially if you don't Farm because you
[01:06:04] have to farm flowers of Paradise Lost
[01:06:06] and you can't go Guild the dreams
[01:06:23] and
[01:12:01] okay wait you can hear me on the webcam

[01:32:47] footage okay
[01:32:50] chat
[01:32:52] chat before we start the stream I have a
[01:32:55] question to ask you guys what is a lucky
[01:32:57] number what is the junk cook number
[01:32:59] seven
[01:33:00] okay because I am considered to be a
[01:33:04] symbol of luck in many
[01:33:06] countries I have been granted by a
[01:33:09] foreign minister sorry seven different
[01:33:11] foreign ministers 100 resin each which
[01:33:14] is why today we have exactly 700 to
[01:33:16] spend obviously I wouldn't want to
[01:33:18] overcap resin but as I was going to
[01:33:20] stream I said I might as well keep it
[01:33:22] for the stream because I'm such a
[01:33:24] graceful and charitable individual
[01:33:26] because of this we need to farm the
[01:33:28] electro Thunder
[01:33:31] [ __ ] and do the new
[01:33:34] domain I wanted I wanted to do R in
[01:33:37] Shogun Abyss clear today on stream
[01:33:39] because I need background footage of
[01:33:40] that but I think we'll do that when sh
[01:33:42] is
[01:33:45] out because we have to play starel today
[01:33:47] so we don't have time to
[01:33:50] Abyss
[01:33:56] who's this for I don't know what do you
[01:34:01] mean I don't think this is for anyone
[01:34:04] actually why am I using Ryden for
[01:34:12] this why Farm it what do you mean I'm
[01:34:14] not farming
[01:34:18] it chev's maths are officially yeah but
[01:34:22] it's just a coincidence that I'm here if
[01:34:24] she needs
[01:34:25] them my logic is just what if a pyro
[01:34:28] character centered around overload needs
[01:34:29] electrom mats so that she could overload
[01:34:31] a of
[01:34:34] course

[01:43:49] you guys
[01:43:56] I have a question to ask you
[01:44:07] guys I have a question to ask you
[01:44:10] guys what the [ __ ] is this I have a
[01:44:13] question to ask you
[01:44:15] guys so when you look at let's say
[01:44:19] um let's say goblets right you see
[01:44:24] goblets like
[01:44:25] this you see goblets like H let me see
[01:44:30] this that we got on day one sorry this
[01:44:32] sorry this that we got on day one of
[01:44:34] dender release you see these nice Hydra
[01:44:36] ones on Echo you see maybe uh Hydra ones
[01:44:40] on uh or maybe let's let's let's look at
[01:44:42] another example uh uh yeah Hydra ones on
[01:44:45] emblem of severed fate you look at maybe
[01:44:48] this pyro one ons set for your y Mia and
[01:44:51] Hut you look at maybe this Petra Geo one
[01:44:54] you look at this nobless one with a
[01:44:55] bunch of er you look at you look at you
[01:44:58] look at you look at these glad ones that
[01:45:01] many characters can use you look at the
[01:45:03] hydro damage ones that are on sorry the
[01:45:06] sorry the Hydra ones that are on the
[01:45:08] heart of depth set that I have one two
[01:45:10] matter of fact I have three and my
[01:45:12] question is you look at these and yeah
[01:45:15] maybe a Pepe W may like H that's kind of
[01:45:17] that's kind of Lucky but do you think
[01:45:20] it's unreasonable to have at least one
[01:45:22] of these on the hydro set no not really
[01:45:25] I have three and I didn't farm this set
[01:45:27] that much now my question is what if you
[01:45:30] were to spend like roughly the
[01:45:31] equivalent of I don't know 130 150,000
[01:45:34] resin in a domain right and strong box
[01:45:37] it stuff like that would you not assume
[01:45:40] to have a goblet maybe of like this
[01:45:42] quality of the element you're looking
[01:45:44] for would that not be like logical to
[01:45:47] have a goblet like this for a Nemo
[01:45:49] because me person personally me calm
[01:45:52] down me personally I don't have a goblet
[01:45:54] like that a Nemo at all the only Nemo I
[01:45:58] have is
[01:46:00] this and I spent more resin here than in
[01:46:02] any other
[01:46:06] domain why am I drinking
[01:46:15] milk no no I can't slice actually told
[01:46:18] me he wants to do the video soon okay we
[01:46:19] actually going to do strong box versus
[01:46:21] slice as soon as I'm back okay for the
[01:46:23] record the reason why I'm not home right
[01:46:25] [ __ ] it one run I agree the reason why
[01:46:28] I'm we're going to do one run the reason
[01:46:29] why I'm not home is because I was here
[01:46:32] for like a couple days to visit because
[01:46:34] it might as well and then I got sick so
[01:46:36] I can't travel until in a few days I
[01:46:38] technically can like tomorrow but or
[01:46:40] Tuesday but Tuesday's shev is release so
[01:46:43] after that I can go back home however
[01:46:45] I'm pretty sure everyone's going to New
[01:46:46] York for the concert the genin concert
[01:46:48] so I might go to that and then I'll go
[01:46:49] home I didn't Even book my tickets yet
[01:46:51] so they're probably like I actually
[01:46:52] should I don't even know how expensive
[01:46:54] they are is it that oh my God okay
[01:46:56] whatever it's fine it's fine it's not
[01:46:58] fine actually I should have booked it
[01:46:59] it's all good we're going to put the
[01:47:00] crystal fly trap back
[01:47:08] here aren't they sold out no no I have
[01:47:10] the concert ticket but I don't have the
[01:47:13] flight book cuz I'm
[01:47:15] stupid it's
[01:47:19] fine
[01:47:27] parametric what should I
[01:47:32] throw why do I never know oh oh I bought
[01:47:35] a bunch of weat so I could throw it and
[01:47:38] cabbage wait no the most the cheapest
[01:47:40] thing to buy is onion actually onions
[01:47:42] meta unless wait are the are the mats
[01:47:44] you get from onion
[01:47:47] terrible holy mid I haven't watched it
[01:47:49] so I don't know only watch two
[01:47:54] seasons okay we'll test it I'll test it
[01:47:56] for the boys at home I'll test if onions
[01:47:58] the cheapest material are a smash or a
[01:48:01] pass for the parametric Transformer are
[01:48:03] they good or are they bad let's
[01:48:18] see I mean it's okay okay it's honestly
[01:48:21] okay that was honestly
[01:48:26] [Music]
[01:48:28] okay is he solo leveling no I'm really
[01:48:31] really bad at watching shows cuz I have
[01:48:32] like no time uh or I'm bad at managing
[01:48:35] my time my days feel short I'm not
[01:48:36] really good at time efficiency um so
[01:48:39] that's on me I'm going to try to be
[01:48:39] better this year that's why I'm trying
[01:48:41] to hire editors and have stuff more
[01:48:42] combized because right now it's like
[01:48:44] there's two second Channel videos that
[01:48:46] are done and the Gan gu is basically
[01:48:47] done but doing the final touches I can't
[01:48:49] [ __ ] be B bothered cuz I have to do
[01:48:50] like a million things at once so I it it
[01:48:52] ends up getting delayed so what I want
[01:48:54] to do is have people that do that [ __ ]
[01:48:55] like I still do most of my like guide
[01:48:57] stuff and a lot of that like the hard
[01:49:00] stuff but a lot of the like tedious [ __ ]
[01:49:01] I want other people to do that's why if
[01:49:03] we launch a Tik Tok if we upload shorts
[01:49:05] which I do I like I let Allan do that
[01:49:07] for me cuz I don't want to have to think
[01:49:08] about that it's too much it's too much
[01:49:10] brain uh
[01:49:12] destruction witness
[01:49:19] my like it's gotten to the point where
[01:49:21] whenever I'm doing other [ __ ] I think
[01:49:23] I'm like [ __ ] I should be doing
[01:49:25] something right now so it's like I can't
[01:49:26] even like relax so I need to like make
[01:49:28] it to where I dial back a bit cuz I'm
[01:49:30] not even like making that much content I
[01:49:32] just like do a lot of it myself I have a
[01:49:35] great feel that help me but like a lot
[01:49:36] of [ __ ] I do myself that I shouldn't do
[01:49:38] myself I feel
[01:49:39] like so
[01:49:46] yeah okay we'll do one condensed
[01:49:49] run just one since we're here oh my God
[01:49:53] if any of these are a Nemo I will
[01:49:55] literally kick my
[01:49:59] webcam

[01:56:41] little quiet I don't know cuz I think I
[01:56:43] I usually stream on three volume but
[01:56:45] when I'm off stream I I [ __ ] yank
[01:56:46] that [ __ ] down to like two cuz I'm not
[01:56:48] trying to listen to p on and three
[01:57:00] volume let's light it
[01:57:05] up Chad watch this watch this rotation
[01:57:07] watch watch are you ready ready watch
[01:57:09] turn turn walk on turn around insta
[01:57:12] burst jeanly turn around again that way
[01:57:16] tap e finina jump jump swab forms plunge
[01:57:20] down Dash claim rewards don't skip don't
[01:57:23] skip don't
[01:57:30] skip watch this crit damage
[01:57:36] okay could be good what if this rolls
[01:57:38] crit damage chat we're going to roll it
[01:57:39] right now we're going to roll it right
[01:57:41] now we're going to roll it right

[01:58:37] only rolls attack from now on it's
[01:58:39] good never
[01:58:46] mind why you leveling this because
[01:58:48] attack percent on uh Mari Mar is pretty
[01:58:53] good very good actually you might have
[01:58:54] too much CR rate to where dude like
[01:58:56] Linny for example doesn't need any
[01:58:58] [ __ ] stats cuz you're stacking git
[01:59:00] damage you have like infinite crit rate
[01:59:02] you get attack with like Bennett and
[01:59:03] power resonance and [ __ ] and you don't
[01:59:05] even need ER so it's like you're just
[01:59:06] building like
[01:59:18] nothing who's your bias don't talk to
[01:59:21] me oo this is going be good this is also
[01:59:24] going to be good actually I don't want
[01:59:26] to lock so many pieces I feel like I'm
[01:59:27] never going to level
[01:59:32] them no I don't know though
[01:59:43] Suga is Linny better than yoia dude I
[01:59:46] think it's taboo to answer if anyone's
[01:59:48] better than yoia I don't know why I feel
[01:59:50] like anytime I answer I get like the I
[01:59:52] get like the [ __ ] Yia police on
[01:59:56] me am I allowed to say
[02:00:04] yes
[02:00:07] it no
[02:00:11] okay L your playlist I
[02:00:18] playlist
[02:00:23] I do agree I think Linny is underrated I
[02:00:25] think Lenny is actually pretty good I
[02:00:27] mean I don't really know how people rate
[02:00:28] him cuz I never hear him be talked about
[02:00:30] which I assume means he's underrated I
[02:00:31] don't know feel like a lot of people
[02:00:33] skipped him I think he's pretty good
[02:00:34] well to be fair if I was casual player
[02:00:36] Andy number five I probably would have
[02:00:38] skipped him cuz the next patch was the
[02:00:39] archon no he was 4.0 not 4.1 who was for
[02:00:42] oh net oh yeah okay but to be fair I
[02:00:46] think he is
[02:00:48] good
[02:00:54] uh let me go let's go conect some resin
[02:00:56] to
[02:00:58] uncap
[02:01:09] sorry is this the new HSR
[02:01:14] mode don't talk to me rank font 10
[02:01:18] DPSS
[02:01:19] Linny is as strong as nevet but he's
[02:01:21] hard to play okay no I love Linny but he
[02:01:23] is not as strong as nevet I love Linny
[02:01:25] don't get me wrong he's not as strong as
[02:01:32] nevet wait how do you even check how do
[02:01:34] you filter my release
[02:01:36] date oh like this dude honestly I think
[02:01:40] all the Fontan DPS are pretty good I
[02:01:42] mean rli's like R is not bad he's just I
[02:01:44] wish his C1 was part of his kit that's
[02:01:46] the only thing I hate about him I think
[02:01:47] his charge attack C1 should be part of
[02:01:49] his kit but outside of
[02:01:51] that I think the I think for the most
[02:01:54] part the font five stars we got are
[02:01:55] pretty good like riz's kind of like
[02:01:58] middle of the pack but it's not like
[02:02:02] bad like I think he's a character that's
[02:02:04] unironically mid but not mid in the way
[02:02:07] that [ __ ] everyone uses mid where mid
[02:02:09] means bad just mid as an actually mid
[02:02:11] which isn't
[02:02:13] bad na'vi is pretty good Len's pretty
[02:02:15] good nad's broken Fin's broken charlet
[02:02:20] from ly's
[02:02:25] cool yeah I I really really want to
[02:02:28] activate a C1 I'm pretty sure I will
[02:02:35] but DEA is mid question mark M no she is
[02:02:38] not mid DEA is in need of
[02:02:42] a relooking at her kit she did get
[02:02:47] indirectly buffed with some font 10
[02:02:49] characters
[02:02:50] though technically uh uh Linny but
[02:02:54] especially
[02:02:55] nevet still
[02:02:59] though oh I crafted a flowing Purity are
[02:03:01] you proud of me are you proud of me oh
[02:03:03] my God zaddy
[02:03:05] sorry so I have two now um I just
[02:03:08] realized though that I kind of want a
[02:03:10] rightful reward for my
[02:03:15] Chev actually no I don't I'm Going H
[02:03:17] full damage I think
[02:03:28] but I kind of want to craft this cuz
[02:03:29] it's
[02:03:31] cool isn't fav better honestly no like Z
[02:03:35] Jeff's going to tell you it's better
[02:03:36] probably and I'm going to recommend it
[02:03:38] in my guide which I already
[02:03:40] recorded but it's not actually better
[02:03:43] because fav is only better if your whole
[02:03:45] team needs energy actually fav could be
[02:03:47] better it could sometimes it is but
[02:03:50] usually with SH is if you're playing her
[02:03:51] as a Healer you're not pressing your que
[02:03:53] like you literally have no reason to
[02:03:55] other than no bless oblig if you're
[02:03:57] running it dude I saw a comment that

[02:11:54] level zero I'm a perfectionist for Shia
[02:11:59] but
[02:12:01] bro that might be our
[02:12:05] best look at how many I have
[02:12:07] dude 100 like 100 like 30k resin wait

[02:12:14] wait wait wait
[02:12:17] wait
[02:12:28] now Jade has to be better but this looks
[02:12:31] insane er ma check we don't need ER

[02:12:38] ER wait this is not bad yo what the [ __ ]
[02:12:43] I was not dude I was like not hype cuz I
[02:12:45] didn't think it was even possible I was
[02:12:47] not hype CU I didn't think this piece
[02:12:49] was even
[02:12:54] possible wait this is so good I mean
[02:12:56] like okay it only had three sub stats it
[02:12:59] could had four Subs level zero it could
[02:13:00] have been better but I can't complain
[02:13:03] all we're missing is a goblet but this
[02:13:04] is a four
[02:13:06] piece This is 40 crit value it's so good
[02:13:09] I'm going to quack listen listen sorry

[02:13:21] ER that's a bit too much crit rate
[02:13:23] though but for the I no ER andies this
[02:13:26] looks
[02:13:37] better wait a second we actually got a
[02:13:39] piece
[02:13:41] chat
[02:13:44] chat they say let him cook and and
[02:13:49] maybe he did
[02:14:03] cook last time I used the optimizer it
[02:14:06] was before I got some of these pieces so
[02:14:07] I could update it they recommended for
[02:14:10] my off piece that I used this like a
[02:14:12] feather but now I have a really good
[02:14:14] feather they wanted me to
[02:14:15] use um this piece it's on Cave right now

[02:14:22] good I mean okay can I can I be a can I
[02:14:26] complain I know I shouldn't complain
[02:14:28] when I get something like

[02:14:45] with a [ __ ] throbbing penis that it
[02:14:47] doesn't look like that whereas like this
[02:14:50] feather

[02:21:10] anemo goblet at this point let's
[02:21:16] see
[02:21:22] so turn the lights off

[02:21:31] better than the glad one

[02:21:39] one has
[02:21:44] attack do you have artifact disort what
[02:21:47] the dude that's not a
[02:21:53] thing although I think at this High okay
[02:21:55] yeah this is [ __ ] stupid I can't lie
[02:21:57] at this High
[02:21:59] investment what's considered better
[02:22:01] despite it not actually being better in
[02:22:02] practice because of one Abyss card but
[02:22:04] it is what it is is literally having
[02:22:06] like exactly 100 crit like look n well
[02:22:09] this one has 92 which is low but 96 96
[02:22:12] 95 93 okay there's a bit lower here 99
[02:22:15] 98 98 98 the top ones 102 103

[02:28:09] 3% but we get 16 ER and we lose the five
[02:28:12] attack
[02:28:13] though
[02:28:15] or
[02:28:20] this one 14
[02:28:23] attack no I can't be that one ER dude I
[02:28:27] yeah I guess do I even need ER though
[02:28:30] feel like I don't but it makes him Cal
[02:28:32] higher so we'll keep
[02:28:35] it I wish I had to like an offset piece
[02:28:37] I could choose if I had a
[02:28:43] goblet
[02:28:45] crit this could get crit right it would
[02:28:48] be great that rhymes so it's true Navia
[02:28:50] please bless us thank you
[02:28:57] okay this one is atrocious but we're
[02:28:59] still going to level
[02:29:01] it
[02:29:10] okay oh this could be
[02:29:14] good wait
[02:29:18] wait chat wait chat wait chat look at
[02:29:21] all these look at look at dude we have
[02:29:25] like we had like seven circlets total
[02:29:27] that could have rolled double crit which
[02:29:28] means in theory we are on hard pity to
[02:29:32] roll crit here but that's just a theory
[02:29:35] a game
[02:29:38] theory thanks for
[02:29:42] [Music]
[02:29:44] watching [ __ ]
[02:29:48] we have one more we have one more this
[02:29:49] one has attack per if it gets CR is
[02:29:51] unironically good unironically and
[02:29:53] unequivocally good you just learned a
[02:29:56] new word write it
[02:30:06] down honestly at this rate [ __ ] it we're
[02:30:08] rolling let's roll this one has ER as
[02:30:10] well what dude dude this piece is
[02:30:12] actually kind of goated just a little
[02:30:14] bit
[02:30:15] though
[02:30:27] D it could have been
[02:30:38] perfect I'm on an artifact rolling high
[02:30:41] right now like I don't want to stop does
[02:30:42] that make sense I really don't want to
[02:30:43] stop does that make sense I know I
[02:30:45] should go play star but I just I don't
[02:30:47] want to stop like I need I need better I
[02:30:49] need
[02:30:50] bigger do we think this is enough to
[02:30:52] make the ultimate sh video I've been
[02:30:54] waiting till I get a good Vermilion set
[02:30:55] is this a good Vermilion set wait I need
[02:30:58] 90 crit rate how do I make my crit rate
[02:31:01] 90 this looks better I
[02:31:04] think 92
[02:31:09] to1 never I think it's
[02:31:12] enough ooh wait we have this
[02:31:15] piece no it's not better though this is
[02:31:18] more crit
[02:31:20] value but this one looks
[02:31:24] better wait let me do some
[02:31:35] math why is this so [ __ ] big
[02:31:40] bro oh it's 207 [ __ ] Li bro why are you
[02:31:45] awake at this time I will spank you
[02:31:48] sorry seven uh what this
[02:31:51] one 19.04 for remember that
[02:32:00] chat wait this is
[02:32:02] higher the other one gives attack
[02:32:05] but why is this
[02:32:09] higher I mean cuz crit rate is more
[02:32:11] valuable for us but or wait no this is
[02:32:13] the lower crit rate
[02:32:15] one
[02:32:19] oh yeah cuz it's this piece okay yeah no
[02:32:20] wonder this is better yeah obviously
[02:32:22] obviously obviously okay I thought we
[02:32:23] were on the other one I was confused
[02:32:25] okay yeah that makes sense that makes
[02:32:27] sense okay
[02:32:30] technically
[02:32:43] technically
[02:32:45] technically if we go this piece that's
[02:32:48] on our
[02:32:50] Linny no where's my other I'm going to
[02:32:53] [ __ ] scream where's my other good one
[02:32:55] bro who has
[02:33:00] it oh [ __ ] Toma if we go this piece
[02:33:04] we're over 90 crit which is better for a
[02:33:05] video even though the er's low it
[02:33:07] doesn't matter so for the video we're
[02:33:08] going to use this build however
[02:33:11] technically this build is better because
[02:33:14] we would get more ER we don't need the
[02:33:16] ER but it would rank higher in Cals so
[02:33:20] technically it's better even though we
[02:33:21] don't need the ER
[02:33:23] cool I'm happy about
[02:33:26] that 92221 looks the best yeah wait what
[02:33:30] this isn't 92 anymore oh yeah cuz cuz we
[02:33:33] changed it wait isn't that like wait a
[02:33:35] second I just realized something 92221
[02:33:38] sounds very familiar what is my old sh
[02:33:40] build look
[02:33:45] like
[02:33:50] okay our old sh build from two sorry
[02:33:53] three years ago was 92 214 so now 3

[02:38:30] Hera
[02:38:38] sorry wait how the
[02:38:42] [ __ ] I'm pretty sure my characters are
[02:38:44] unironically geared though like I I feel
[02:38:45] like I keep everyone geared in this game
[02:38:47] not even copium by the way not even wait
[02:38:49] I want to where do I want to go memory
[02:38:50] chaos uh memory chaos is this tab oh
[02:38:54] wait there it
[02:38:56] is why is farog looking at me like
[02:39:03] that Mr lament sorry M lament I recently
[02:39:07] received a pet yeah I'd
[02:39:14] win
[02:39:22] is actually good now why the followup
[02:39:24] attack
[02:39:28] set dude that set I can't get a good
[02:39:30] followup attack set for the life of me
[02:39:33] look at how many I have matters
[02:39:37] look uh where is it I might have thrown
[02:39:40] some away but like look I've literally
[02:39:42] been doing this domain okay it doesn't
[02:39:44] look like that many but I promise it's a
[02:39:45] lot what most of them are
[02:39:53] [ __ ] do you know how to fix
[02:39:57] star
[02:39:58] tradit move on
[02:40:02] already pure Fiction's AOE propaganda
[02:40:05] really that's what they did when they
[02:40:06] released inor they released inor Lun
[02:40:08] said H here is swarm and swarm is
[02:40:10] literally inv Lun propaganda so I
[02:40:13] actually assume we're going to want to
[02:40:14] use Argent t
[02:40:16] I literally assume we're going to want
[02:40:17] to use Argent I think my Argent is built
[02:40:19] so it's
[02:40:33] fine can you unbench jinguan then
[02:40:36] please oh wait did I just say no
[02:40:44] [ __ ]
[02:40:51] I can't believe they made this game mode
[02:40:52] just so Z as an excuse to use the heo ly
[02:40:55] cone dude I've been telling you that
[02:40:58] lonee is slept on okay I've been telling
[02:41:00] you I've been telling
[02:41:03] you what the [ __ ] is Kaka I should have
[02:41:06] read what they just said all good when
[02:41:08] an ultimate sorry when an ally sorry
[02:41:10] when allies use their ultimate to attack
[02:41:12] enemy Target inflict the target with
[02:41:13] shatter s up to six times at the start
[02:41:16] of their turn or when the target is
[02:41:17] defeated deals a set amount of damage oh
[02:41:19] to adjacent okay that makes sense so it
[02:41:21] you [ __ ] if you kill a minion it'll
[02:41:22] [ __ ] up the other dudes what is this
[02:41:28] erupt
[02:41:30] okay okay when battle
[02:41:36] okay
[02:41:42] okay okay s four characters wait why are
[02:41:47] you making me do this now I don't know
[02:41:48] bro stop
[02:41:51] stop
[02:41:55] um this
[02:42:13] one ruptures op

[02:42:18] is wait what is shatter again that's the
[02:42:21] oh that's these
[02:42:22] things yeah okay I just don't know how
[02:42:24] much damage they
[02:42:26] do anyways
[02:42:28] um wait so if a if AOE is good in this
[02:42:31] game mode which is what I'm getting then
[02:42:33] we probably want to play Argent maybe
[02:42:34] genu but uh we don't talk about his
[02:42:36] build so probably
[02:42:39] Argent um but this these are Level 55 so
[02:42:42] I don't think it matters so we'll
[02:42:44] probably just do iner and
[02:42:47] bald uh where's Ron May Ron May is
[02:42:52] uh here and our healer is here and then
[02:42:56] first half we have healer oh sorry BR

[02:46:58] cutting sand uh old school RuneScape and
[02:47:01] I think one other thing playing at the
[02:47:02] same
[02:47:10] time wait this is actually AOE
[02:47:12] propaganda
[02:47:13] though
[02:47:19] worlding
[02:47:30] TR
[02:47:33] okay we need 30k points right we already
[02:47:35] have
[02:47:37] that is there a limit to how many points
[02:47:40] you can get or if I get 30k or get like
[02:47:41] Envy got 31k is that what the type of
[02:47:43] game mode it is or

[02:48:21] laying down the dick of Justice was it I
[02:48:24] don't know closer
[02:48:38] sounding all will be swept away by the
[02:48:43] wind Bab [ __ ] cely why do you guys hate

[02:49:29] me St more or less fun than genin
[02:49:31] they're completely different I just
[02:49:32] think it's harder for me to be
[02:49:34] entertaining when I'm not playing when
[02:49:36] I'm playing a game where I have to
[02:49:37] either think or if it's just purely Auto
[02:49:39] Battle which is why I like even though I
[02:49:41] play stle off stream I like streaming
[02:49:43] genin more cuz like I like playing St
[02:49:46] but it's harder for me to like talk cuz
[02:49:47] I'm like thinking about what to do or
[02:49:48] it's Auto battling that's
[02:49:55] all in lunar flame in lunar
[02:50:02] flame too little savor it for

[03:24:52] to make a
[03:24:58] bet so we're going to throw Theseus 11
[03:25:07] months actually we might as well just
[03:25:09] throw these

[03:46:36] in lunar
[03:46:38] Flame not bad though not bad though and
[03:46:42] elegance grace and
[03:46:52] elegance someone said I'm trailblaze
[03:46:54] level 48 and I haven't done any Auto
[03:46:56] Battle and then someone replied with

[03:47:00] I'm not second of all all these
[03:47:02] characters are e z third of all I am the
[03:47:05] maximum trailblaze level yeah I maybe at
[03:47:10] ar48 at t48 you can't Auto this that's
[03:47:16] normal that paradise May savor it for
[03:47:24] me failed
[03:47:27] to S1 arm true I'm S1 S1 the no s no s
[03:47:34] for the other two only half of them have
[03:47:36] S1 all will be swept away by the wind
[03:47:40] only half that's like a
[03:47:47] 50% I'm calling my mom tell her I say hi
[03:47:56] F nothing
[03:47:59] major oh damn honestly not even bad for
[03:48:03] no [ __ ] weakness break that's fine we
[03:48:05] got three
[03:48:07] stars could have got an 80k but is what
[03:48:09] it is I don't feel like building J
[03:48:12] what's his
[03:48:13] name
[03:48:16] jingu nice she heard you
[03:48:31] oh sure W build it's like turbo easy
[03:48:35] it's literally nothing she just has a
[03:48:38] [ __ ] T HP enough speed and then the rest
[03:48:40] is effect res or defense literally just
[03:48:43] effect res piece okay this piece sucks
[03:48:45] it shouldn't even be on her I don't know
[03:48:46] what her piece her normal piece is on
[03:48:47] someone else I don't know who this one
[03:48:49] has speed and defense that's probably
[03:48:51] the one I was using and then HP speed
[03:48:57] HP pretty easy I'm on
[03:49:06] this I can't use your stream as a
[03:49:08] podcast wait why literally why not name
[03:49:11] me one reason why you
[03:49:17] wouldn't what's Ron May speed like 160
[03:49:20] or something I have okay never mind even
[03:49:22] less but usually it's around 160 uh but
[03:49:25] it's 148 right
[03:49:27] now or who do I have on I have someone
[03:49:29] 160 oh it was BR and then I changed it
[03:49:31] that's
[03:49:34] why does my space bar still not
[03:49:38] work
[03:49:48] podcast doesn't have a guy moaning all
[03:49:50] the time okay but neither does this
[03:49:53] stream neither does this
[03:49:56] stream neither does this
[03:50:07] stream okay chat I want to do one more
[03:50:09] thing what should we do should we
[03:50:11] actually do golden gears I don't know if
[03:50:13] I want to start this should I I haven't
[03:50:14] done it
[03:50:17] yet this seems
[03:50:21] complicated yep yep yep yep
[03:50:33] y difficulty V this is
[03:50:38] hard
[03:50:43] what the [ __ ] are band
[03:50:48] paths
[03:50:49] what probably should have read
[03:51:05] that that's pretty
[03:51:08] cool just do
[03:51:10] destruction does destruction synergize
[03:51:12] with the same ones as the other one it
[03:51:14] used to synergize with like the [ __ ]
[03:51:16] Shield
[03:51:18] one uh healing over
[03:51:25] time it's
[03:51:31] fine do erudition
[03:51:34] Argent
[03:51:36] ew I mean we could
[03:51:53] this doesn't look like a short stream
[03:51:55] yeah every time I put short stream in

[04:18:55] start zero SP I mean none of these
[04:18:57] characters need SP like Argent uses one
[04:18:59] tun uses one every [ __ ] three every
[04:19:02] time this three turn thing expires fun
[04:19:04] us one every time her field expires and
[04:19:06] w
[04:19:14] you have been devoted to a onear
[04:19:16] character okay what does that even mean
[04:19:19] what does that even mean what does that
[04:19:21] even
[04:19:23] mean oh what is this when entering a
[04:19:25] battle charge brain and the vat breaking
[04:19:27] enemy weakness charge brain and the vat
[04:19:28] okay let's take brain and the
[04:19:31] vat I'm going to read all three of these
[04:19:33] and then determine which one I want when
[04:19:36] character defeat an enemy with synapse
[04:19:39] the effect is additionally granted
[04:19:41] triggered two times that seems good but
[04:19:43] the boss are probably going to be mostly
[04:19:45] single
[04:19:46] Target okay when an enemy appears
[04:19:49] resonate regenerate path resonance
[04:19:51] energy equal to 5% of all Max HPS
[04:19:57] energies when enemy Target with synops
[04:19:59] resonance is attacked by ultimate the
[04:20:02] enemy Target with the highest Max HP
[04:20:04] takes damage increased ooh I like that
[04:20:06] for like single
[04:20:08] Target or for bosses I
[04:20:12] mean this is really good for spamming
[04:20:17] it and then this is good for
[04:20:20] bosses maybe this first and then this
[04:20:25] one energy first yeah that's what I was
[04:20:28] thinking oh cage what is this bring in
[04:20:30] this curio into an adventure domain will
[04:20:32] cause the domain's time Li to be
[04:20:33] increased wait isn't the adventure
[04:20:36] domain that the one I accidentally
[04:20:37] turned into a combat
[04:20:48] domain plus 30 okay easy
[04:20:54] unlock oh
[04:21:05] oops
[04:21:09] okay do have Adventure oo oo
[04:21:15] o
[04:21:17] downloader chat do I want Ron May
[04:21:23] here that's reward oh wait do we not
[04:21:26] have
[04:21:34] Adventure I think I still need double
[04:21:36] sustain though should I bench Yun
[04:21:39] sag I don't want to benching Yun
[04:21:44] sag I mean it's she's so broken
[04:22:00] but to sustain Andy I mean ideally I run
[04:22:04] Ron and Ting Yun
[04:22:12] but honestly enhancing would be really
[04:22:15] good here but I'm going to go for a
[04:22:16] curio because I'm greedy possessing this
[04:22:17] curio is the equivalent of one blessing
[04:22:19] of each path oh unlock uh this is pretty
[04:22:22] good too uh cuz we're going to be doing
[04:22:24] a lot of this allow out this is fine R
[04:22:29] forward plus
[04:22:35] 30
[04:22:45] cool we're definitely going here my
[04:22:48] question is do I want to tank the
[04:22:50] countdown and go up or down first when I
[04:22:52] was doing swarm I felt like the
[04:22:53] countdown unless you're going really
[04:22:55] overboard like didn't really [ __ ]
[04:22:57] matter so I might do like a currence
[04:23:00] into that
[04:23:02] maybe [ __ ] it I'll be greedy we're going
[04:23:04] to CR and we're going to go get the
[04:23:06] chest

[04:23:33] something

[04:24:09] transaction to cash out right
[04:24:11] now but I kind of want to go to this
[04:24:13] thing there's no way we don't go to the
[04:24:15] reward there's literally no way we
