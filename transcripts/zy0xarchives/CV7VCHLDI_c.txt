[00:38:29] who's like a musician I didn't catch it
[00:38:30] he's like yo look at this guy his thing
[00:38:32] or I think it was a girl and then the
[00:38:33] guy gave him okay this girl's violin
[00:38:35] snapped while she was playing a genin
[00:38:37] song near the start and then the guy
[00:38:39] next to him ultimate rizzler by the way
[00:38:42] handed her his violin and then he was
[00:38:44] like like he like kind of stopped
[00:38:45] playing he's going to go get his own or
[00:38:46] whatever rizzler and then for some like
[00:38:50] that happened and then it kept going and
[00:38:52] then literally for some random reason
[00:38:53] the cameraman zoomed in on the dude with
[00:38:56] the like with no violin just sitting
[00:38:58] there so they [ __ ] did him dirty
[00:38:59] actually true if you were there by the
[00:39:01] way it's not fake and so the guy
[00:39:03] literally had no [ __ ] violin and the
[00:39:05] cameraman zoomed in on him so then I was
[00:39:06] like okay I'm not going to [ __ ] stand
[00:39:07] for this [ __ ] out egregiousness so I
[00:39:11] jumped off the balcony landed perfectly
[00:39:13] on my feet cuz I don't take plunge
[00:39:14] damage I'm Shia literally ran up handed
[00:39:16] him a violin that I brought just in case
[00:39:18] and he thanked me said oh my God you
[00:39:20] literally saved my life and the concert
[00:39:21] then they played my
[00:39:24] theme and give me some resin so I can SP

[01:08:37] that will be revealed there's some
[01:08:38] things that you hear just by existing so
[01:08:40] there's some things that I know but like
[01:08:41] for the most part I've stayed mostly
[01:08:46] away I just know I just know that cloud
[01:08:49] retainer is going to be cool that's all
[01:08:50] I know that's the only thing I
[01:08:52] know for reference I have no clue what
[01:08:55] gaming gaming even looks like in any way
[01:08:58] other than his official art cuz I don't
[01:08:59] give a [ __ ] but I've heard Cloud
[01:09:01] retainer rumors that's
[01:09:04] all other here you no I don't Zach
[01:09:06] doesn't tell me anything I tell him not
[01:09:09] to unless it's like math related like
[01:09:11] unless it's like artifact set stuff like
[01:09:14] comparing or some
[01:09:22] [ __ ]
[01:09:26] D I made it all the way
[01:09:28] down ging enjoyers We rise I mean I no
[01:09:32] disrespect to him I'm sure he'll be cool
[01:09:34] I've heard people say he's cool I just I
[01:09:36] I'm I don't really like I don't care
[01:09:38] until I see the character if I see him
[01:09:39] and he looks cool I'm hype if I don't
[01:09:41] see him and he doesn't look cool I don't
[01:09:42] care did I just punch a cat sorry C high
[01:09:45] stream
[01:09:52] frequency
[01:10:06] sorry I'm sorry I don't know why I did
[01:10:15] that yes the stream is 6 minutes from
[01:10:18] starting there's no music playing though
[01:10:20] can I
[01:10:22] react love
[01:10:26] hype thanks for
[01:10:30] sharing one year aboba
[01:10:36] aboba scar SP usable on sh yeah it's
[01:10:52] fine
[01:10:54] there's so many [ __ ] pole arms you
[01:10:55] can use on them
[01:10:58] also xenophobic spear might get
[01:11:03] better if Cloud retainer is good with
[01:11:05] him because uh she is from the same
[01:11:07] region as
[01:11:10] him so that's
[01:11:21] cool engulfing looks so good r
[01:11:26] D what if I use prospector
[01:11:36] drill sh career will be overcapped I
[01:11:39] mean just don't go uh just don't go Mar
[01:11:40] Shi it's fine like you should build Mar
[01:11:43] CH if like it's more resin efficient but
[01:11:45] if you're playing sha with Jade death
[01:11:47] match a lot of these weapons they give
[01:11:49] you a lot of crit rate so it's harder
[01:11:50] you can still go it but it's is harder
[01:11:53] if you get a lot of crit rate like
[01:11:54] especially like death match
[01:12:02] 36 that pole arm is double the height of
[01:12:04] Shia okay the pole arms scale with the
[01:12:07] height of characters weapon scale it's
[01:12:09] why Wolf's gravestone looks [ __ ]
[01:12:11] massive on duuke but looks tiny on saou
[01:12:14] so it's because he's tall that the
[01:12:15] weapon's
[01:12:16] tall look look at Ya Yao this [ __ ] looks
[01:12:20] like a
[01:12:22] toothpick
[01:12:29] I hope we can still pick fre ya Yao yeah
[01:12:31] so broken is MH better than I actually
[01:12:34] don't remember what her constellations
[01:12:35] do doesn't C6 give like dendro damage or
[01:12:37] is that Kirara no that's her I
[01:12:41] think never mind it was Kirara I was
[01:12:44] thinking of
[01:12:46] Kirara oh no it's a C1 never mind I was
[01:12:48] thinking it for
[01:12:49] C1 but this doesn't really matter in
[01:12:52] like any uh team except like alight
[01:12:55] them that also doesn't
[01:13:01] matter
[01:13:12] yeah what about aggravate yeah this
[01:13:14] doesn't matter for you don't need em on
[01:13:16] your y Yao for aggravate you're not
[01:13:17] aggravating your ya I mean you're not
[01:13:19] spreading on ya ya you just press e on
[01:13:21] her and then swap if you m the C1 it
[01:13:23] doesn't matter C1 is denter damage bonus
[01:13:25] for active character which matters if
[01:13:26] you're playing her with like alham or
[01:13:28] tanari but it doesn't matter in a lot of
[01:13:30] her teams are Quicken or like you could
[01:13:32] play with Neu Bloom which is yeah but
[01:13:34] like outside of that like if you're
[01:13:35] playing like Quicken or aggravate your
[01:13:37] Electro characters are doing damage not
[01:13:38] ya ya which is why she goes instructor
[01:13:40] not [ __ ] sorry which is why in that team
[01:13:43] she would be on instructor not deepwood
[01:13:45] but I'm not an instructor so don't talk

[02:05:43] playay count needs the free fourstar
[02:05:44] which is something else we're getting
[02:05:46] and that is huge uh uh where is
[02:05:52] it where the [ __ ] is calm
[02:05:56] down wait where's the oh I guess they
[02:05:58] didn't [ __ ] post it we're get a free

[02:06:09] not I'm going to click home if there's a
[02:06:10] caul on my TL that's not my
[02:06:12] fault yeah so that's pretty
[02:06:15] cool choose whoever you want uh I think
[02:06:19] yo they actually ordered it yo they
[02:06:21] almost ordered this in power level
[02:06:23] almost almost okay not really but they
[02:06:26] kind of it's kind of like they like
[02:06:27] segregated it look look look look look
[02:06:29] look this is the cut off these [ __ ]
[02:06:32] characters these characters right here
[02:06:33] are I don't know about ging yet but
[02:06:35] these characters right here are broken
[02:06:37] and then he's new
[02:06:39] new
[02:06:42] broken and then these are like if you
[02:06:45] want if you want
[02:06:51] Dam leave Yen alone I mean I said if you
[02:06:55] want I didn't say she's bad I said if
[02:06:56] you want if you want her get her but
[02:06:59] like I would argue any account that ever
[02:07:02] exists gets better with this character
[02:07:04] this character this character and
[02:07:06] probably this character but you can't
[02:07:07] say the like the last few it
[02:07:17] depends

[02:07:27] better G Shan horing
[02:07:30] TR where the [ __ ] are the
[02:07:42] skins I think they're both good I think
[02:07:45] gas is probably better I'm just biased
[02:07:47] to liking Shan
[02:07:52] more like I like shano more than I like
[02:07:54] guu but I think the G Skin's better

[02:14:41] really hope they do this even if it
[02:14:43] isn't like that amazing just imagine if
[02:14:46] we had an event like that
[02:14:48] every patch that's what I said I said
[02:14:50] wish it was permanent it's actually a
[02:14:51] raid yeah yeah like holy [ __ ] I am so
[02:14:55] hyped wait what if we what if we what if
[02:14:58] we what if we what if we do that boss
[02:15:00] but we're we we like make it hard like
[02:15:01] we use like onear weapons yeah dude I'm
[02:15:04] I'm [ __ ] down I mean okay that's good
[02:15:06] content if if if we're being honest here
[02:15:09] you say that now and you will Don aall
[02:15:11] me until the event is gone so like y
[02:15:14] real that's not going to happen that's
[02:15:15] not going to happen that's not going to
[02:15:16] I'm going to write it down I'm going to
[02:15:16] write I'm going to message my
[02:15:20] now yo what if this new Raid event we
[02:15:24] made into a challenge video with like
[02:15:27] one star weapons do the hypostasis event
[02:15:31] Nick where we supposed to co-op it ha
[02:15:34] yeah I do we wait do you think we could
[02:15:36] two player or do we need four CU if we
[02:15:37] do four people then there's like eight
[02:15:39] videos about it and then none of our
[02:15:40] videos are going to be special but if we
[02:15:41] do it just us then I think it'll be
[02:15:43] it'll be
[02:15:45] better you can we can just get get two
[02:15:48] viewers oh that's true I mean we could
[02:15:51] also get two other CC like we get people
[02:15:52] but it's just like we have to make sure
[02:15:54] they have onear weapons cuz we don't
[02:15:55] want we don't have to like cheat or
[02:15:58] whatever if that's even like if that's
[02:15:59] not hard enough we'll just remove our
[02:16:00] flower or some [ __ ] or we could use
[02:16:03] level one character like we I I think
[02:16:04] there's a very real chance that it might
[02:16:07] not look at actual damage
[02:16:11] though that's
[02:16:14] [ __ ]

[02:30:55] go to the casino [ __ ] no don't don't but
[02:30:57] I mean what if you do that in game in
[02:30:59] Gin is not a big deal if it's with real
[02:31:01] life money don't do it but in genin it's

[02:31:16] the reputation oh you keep wasting your
[02:31:18] your stuff oh oh he's addicted okay what
[02:31:20] would you rather would you rather me

[02:31:26] gacha games all of which I need to get
[02:31:29] every [ __ ] character that I like in
[02:31:31] or or just spend resin in a domain cuz
[02:31:35] me personally I would choose the L the
[02:31:38] former the
[02:31:43] latter you do both no I don't
[02:31:47] at least there's pity and gotcha true
[02:31:49] wait actually speaking of which I'm
[02:31:50] actually going to I'm going to buy I'm
[02:31:53] going to buy the new [ __ ] the Pokemon

[02:31:56] shiny finding the same domain I actually
[02:31:59] have to go Abyss Z I'm like about to
[02:32:05] Abyss we can do two
[02:32:09] runs I mean I guess I could uncap my
[02:32:11] resin but I don't know should I even do
[02:32:13] this okay first question should I
[02:32:14] actually do this domain that's question
[02:32:16] one
[02:32:20] question one is should I actually do
[02:32:21] this
[02:32:24] domain
[02:32:26] yep okay we can do it
[02:32:29] then you spend money anyways cuz time is
[02:32:32] money okay you can't just do that it's
[02:32:35] not the
[02:32:38] same but by that logic by that logic by
[02:32:42] that logic by that logic if you're free
[02:32:44] to play but you play the game 26 hours a
[02:32:47] day you're a whale is that really true

[03:27:16] should say I can use a friendship team
[03:27:18] it's
[03:27:33] [Music]
[03:27:34] fine should I play with my y Miko
[03:27:40] um
[03:27:42] uh
[03:28:00] anyone okay I
[03:28:03] actually hate these
[03:28:07] enemies yeah n he is broken uh not a
[03:28:11] [ __ ] not a surprise to say that but I
[03:28:14] don't think there's there's very few
[03:28:15] characters that are worth pulling more
[03:28:16] than Nita so if you don't have her
[03:28:19] probably should get
[03:28:21] her if you play
[03:28:23] dendro she's pretty
[03:28:37] broken this is my
[03:28:40] numbing
[03:28:42] anyone who guesses the exact number here
[03:28:44] five gied I'm thinking 202 oh
[03:28:50] [Music]
[03:29:01] 27 what makes Nita so good uh because
[03:29:04] she's short she has a low hit BX so she
[03:29:06] doesn't take damage from enemies also uh
[03:29:09] because she's a catalyst she can use o
[03:29:11] sworn eye uh or uh she could also use um
[03:29:15] what's the weapon called uh uh [ __ ]
[03:29:17] hakushin no not hakushin uh eye of
[03:29:19] perception and you can go a physical
[03:29:21] Nita build so your mark is pretty good
[03:29:23] and then you're because you're physical
[03:29:25] you can uh deal with bosses like dendro
[03:29:27] hypostasis and like the ocean and stuff
[03:29:29] very easily cuz physical is really
[03:29:31] broken in engin so that's why Nita is
[03:29:33] good I
[03:29:40] think
[03:29:45] no but Nita just she has like in oh I
[03:29:48] missed dude I was Point
[03:29:51] Blank anyways
[03:29:54] Nikita Nikita has like insane D op and
[03:29:56] like her damage is good and her Buffs
[03:29:58] are
[03:29:59] good explain why Kazo is good no if you
[03:30:02] have to if you need to be explained why
[03:30:04] Kazo is good then you're it doesn't
[03:30:06] explaining Kazo is doing him a
[03:30:07] disservice just [ __ ] play him and
[03:30:09] you'll
[03:30:10] see
[03:30:11] or watch him being played like it's it's
[03:30:13] literally like it's just I don't
[03:30:16] know it's about the feel it's like a
[03:30:19] feeling you can't you can't describe
[03:30:21] feelings you can't describe let's say
[03:30:24] let's say there's a okay let's say an
[03:30:26] alien comes to earth right and they
[03:30:27] can't feel pain you can't describe to
[03:30:30] them what pain feels like they won't get
[03:30:31] it like they'll understand okay it's
[03:30:33] like a bad thing right you you try to
[03:30:35] avoid it okay it's like to show that
[03:30:37] like okay this is bad but like you can't
[03:30:39] make them feel it that's kind of like
[03:30:41] Kaza but you can't make a non-azo feel
[03:30:44] what Kaza feel feels what it feels like
[03:30:46] to have
[03:30:49] Kaza you
[03:31:01] can you talk me out of getting Nita
[03:31:04] there are no Alternatives okay if I talk
[03:31:06] you out of Nita then you're dumb I never
[03:31:08] said don't pull Nita I've always said
[03:31:10] she's like top two top three pulls but
[03:31:12] if you feel like you have to pull for
[03:31:14] her or your account sucks then you're
[03:31:15] dumb sorry that's not true but like I
[03:31:18] don't
[03:31:19] know wait I've never if anything I've
[03:31:21] overhyped her I've never underhyped
[03:31:23] her I think the's broken but
[03:31:29] like okay if you play Quicken I think
[03:31:32] she's not I think if you play Quicken
[03:31:34] there's like a lot of Alternatives like
[03:31:37] if you're playing like a a dude what the
[03:31:38] [ __ ] is this enemy doing if you play
[03:31:41] quickin there's like a lot of
[03:31:42] Alternatives cuz you can do like Yao yaa
[03:31:44] baiju uh as like a two or Kirara as like
[03:31:46] a two in one like healer and like d drop
[03:31:50] but
[03:31:55] um it it was like basically every other
[03:31:58] including that team the is really good
[03:31:59] but for like basically every other
[03:32:01] dendro team Nita is just like the
[03:32:03] best although you can also Play N Bloom
[03:32:05] without Nikita there's a few uh a few
[03:32:08] newer ones like when Neu first came out
[03:32:10] a lot of teams were kind of like Co o
[03:32:13] wait that's really good all our teams
[03:32:14] are kind of cope but like now there's a
[03:32:16] lot of D units you can use you use
[03:32:17] alight them you ya ya you could use
[03:32:19] quite a lot of characters Z The Raid
[03:32:20] appreciate it shout out I'm probably
[03:32:22] ending soon though but I appreciate
[03:32:25] it let me roll the
[03:32:37] [Music]
[03:32:38] sounds wait where the [ __ ] is the sand I
[03:32:40] just got
[03:32:42] what is my what the [ __ ] are my
[03:32:43] artifacts oh it's
[03:32:50] filtering no Abyss oh [ __ ] we have to
[03:32:53] the
[03:32:56] abyss why is there a difference between
[03:32:58] aggravate Quicken and Hyper Bloom why
[03:32:59] isal only use for Quicken and not hyper
[03:33:02] okay I X actually made me sober up uh
[03:33:07] let me explain this the easiest way I
[03:33:09] can and then we'll roll this piece
[03:33:12] okay Quicken aggravate and spread are
[03:33:15] basically all the same thing except
[03:33:16] aggravate is for Electro spread is for
[03:33:19] dendro but you just call both Quicken
[03:33:20] it's just they buff both okay fishal is
[03:33:22] really good there because her damage she
[03:33:24] applies a lot of Electro and her damage
[03:33:25] increased a lot by aggravate so she's
[03:33:27] really cracked hyper hyper Bloom is
[03:33:30] different it is a dentro hydro reaction
[03:33:33] that's Bloom and then you put Electro
[03:33:34] and then hyper blooms right okay why Fel
[03:33:37] isn't mostly used in hyper Bloom is
[03:33:38] because one you want to Stack damage on
[03:33:40] her not em two she can't really Target
[03:33:42] the cores that's the main thing Oz
[03:33:44] doesn't Target cores or he does but he
[03:33:46] prioritizes
[03:33:47] enemies so usually for hyper blo use
[03:33:50] other characters and for Quicken you use
[03:33:51] Fel however Fel is also broken in hyper
[03:33:54] Bloom if you're running an anemo
[03:33:56] character as well like sucros or sucros
[03:33:59] basically sucros I mean you can do like
[03:34:01] some Scara things but basically just
[03:34:03] sucros because you can still get all the
[03:34:05] benefits of fishal because she's broken
[03:34:07] and then just swirl the [ __ ] Electro
[03:34:09] onto the cores with super
[03:34:12] gross but yeah that's mostly
[03:34:16] it they're very different hyper blo is
[03:34:18] yeah so Quicken and aggravate hyper is a
[03:34:20] transformative reaction it only scales
[03:34:22] on em and level so the only damage that
[03:34:25] is calculated like well there's also
[03:34:27] like resistances and stuff but like
[03:34:29] hyper Blom does more damage the more em
[03:34:31] you have and assuming your level 90 does
[03:34:32] way more than like level 80 or whatever
[03:34:34] whereas Quicken and aggravate those are
[03:34:36] reactions that like kind of like
[03:34:37] vaporize well I don't know how to
[03:34:39] explain it but basically they can like
[03:34:40] crit and stuff and like factoring damage
[03:34:42] bonuses and [ __ ] so like if you're
[03:34:43] stacking damage on your official she
[03:34:45] does good damage and then if you
[03:34:46] aggravate she does even more damage okay
[03:34:48] let's all the
[03:34:56] s [ __ ] it plus word
[03:35:00] d oo I
[03:35:03] mean honestly okay listen honestly we
[03:35:06] really need this set so this is not bad
[03:35:09] we actually take this
[03:35:15] [ __ ]
[03:35:17] well levels taken into consideration for
[03:35:20] em no it's not no no so levels taken
[03:35:23] into consideration for
[03:35:26] um what is it
[03:35:29] called uh uh for transformative
[03:35:31] reactions it's so like they scale off of
[03:35:35] em and your level your level doesn't
[03:35:37] affect your em so like same with swirl
[03:35:40] same with overload
[03:35:53] right it's quick transformative
[03:35:56] no it doesn't like you don't need to
[03:35:58] know what they're called just know that
[03:36:01] like um well I mean I guess it helps to
[03:36:03] know what they're called but know that
[03:36:04] like hyper Bloom you want to Stack em
[03:36:05] and then Quicken vaporize all that [ __ ]
[03:36:07] like crit is
[03:36:09] better well em helps too but like that
[03:36:12] wasn't a good
[03:36:14] explanation they scale on em em helps
[03:36:16] your damage but they they also scale on
[03:36:18] crit and damage it's not just
[03:36:21] em some reactions only scale on em the
[03:36:24] others em benefits like vaporiz you want
[03:36:26] to have like 100 to 200 em is better
[03:36:28] than crit and then the rest crit's
[03:36:29] better so it just
[03:36:33] depends also depends how often your
[03:36:36] character can Vape or whatever the [ __ ]
[03:36:38] aggravate like aggravate like Em's
[03:36:40] really good on like Fishel or kaching
[03:36:43] but it's not really good on like bet cuz
[03:36:44] she doesn't proc that many like her
[03:36:46] scalings are really big numbers instead
[03:36:48] of multiple small ones that aggravate
[03:36:50] anyways uh let me
[03:36:53] cond
[03:37:09] cool
[03:37:13] I wonder if I should do it best if I
[03:37:14] should save
[03:37:16] it CU now might be a good time for me to
[03:37:19] just be normal and BGE or
[03:37:28] record yeah I'll save it what if I just
[03:37:30] stream again later boom bonus stream
[03:37:32] okay that's what I'm going to do I'll
[03:37:33] stream again very soon and we'll do
[03:37:36] genin maybe valorant randomly we'll see
[03:37:38] I just got back home so I'm probably
[03:37:39] washed but we'll stream again very soon
[03:37:41] it'll be genin and I'll do um yeah maybe
[03:37:45] we'll do variety but well uh also Abyss
[03:37:49] if you guys want to submit your gameplay
[03:37:50] in the abyss maybe you need help maybe
[03:37:52] you can't clear ideally scuffed content
[03:37:53] like scuffed clears cuz I think it'll be
[03:37:55] funny but even if you can maybe we'll be
[03:37:57] able to make content out that you can
[03:37:58] submit your like unlisted YouTube video
[03:38:01] in our Abyss forms that are going to be
[03:38:02] out in our announcement channel in
[03:38:03] Discord it's Discord you can submit it
[03:38:06] we're going to watch them on stream make
[03:38:07] a video out of it I think it's Banger
[03:38:08] content that I haven't seen anyone else
[03:38:09] do and then will probably be copied by
[03:38:11] everyone if it's good or if it's bad
[03:38:12] it'll be dog [ __ ] also hi Kos who I'm
[03:38:14] down to play uh it'll be out today or
[03:38:17] I'm a scammer okay probably tomorrow no
[03:38:19] surely today uh outside of that Gan
[03:38:21] guide is done I just have to rewatch it
[03:38:23] and I'm going to make a video on which
[03:38:25] fourar from the last you should choose
[03:38:26] and I recorded like last patch Last
[03:38:29] Christmas I recorded which five star
[03:38:32] characters have the highest pull value
[03:38:33] and I kind of rank them all so we're
[03:38:35] gonna do that that video is gonna be
[03:38:36] uploaded at some point I recorded it
[03:38:38] before Navia came out I don't think
[03:38:39] Navia really uh is in the top like it's
[03:38:42] mostly support video so it doesn't
[03:38:43] matter uh but I'll wait till sh uh Cloud
[03:38:46] retainer is out to see if how good she
[03:38:48] is but after that I'll upload it anyways
[03:38:50] thanks for watching I'll see you soon uh
[03:38:52] after oh
[03:38:54] Also regarding 4.4 there's those videos
[03:38:56] I just talked about we're also going to
[03:38:57] do a new sh guide with cl like assuming
[03:39:00] Cloud retainer is good with him if not I
[03:39:01] still need a new one for farizon and
[03:39:03] finina anyways so there's going to be a
[03:39:04] new sh guide there's going to be a cloud

[03:39:15] we're going to make a new duuke video
[03:39:17] finally and then who knows after that
[03:39:19] probably like Shang Ling or something
[03:39:20] cuz Shang Ling's gotten so many new
[03:39:21] weapons and [ __ ] sets she can use
[03:39:23] it's kind of stupid we'll see 2our Shia
[03:39:26] guide
