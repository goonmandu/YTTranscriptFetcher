[00:10:05] honest
[00:10:10] anyways dude how do you even draw that
[00:10:13] with
[00:10:15] dots what up cover up I wanted to do a
[00:10:19] ging guide but it's literally done

[00:11:01] out the second it drops with
[00:11:03] pre-recorded footage I don't have that
[00:11:05] which means we're going to have to Asia
[00:11:06] server test and then upload within the
[00:11:09] same day ideally uh so give me like 12
[00:11:13] hours after she's out uh

[00:27:23] points and damage boost well more damage
[00:27:27] from your talent that's prettyy good uh
[00:27:31] assuming the action Advance is enough to
[00:27:34] be relevant that's crit damage that's
[00:27:36] Advance that's uh more skill points here
[00:27:40] and more damage through your talent and
[00:27:42] ALT
[00:27:44] and uh there's another
[00:27:46] Trace that gives
[00:27:48] attack increases all allies

[00:29:33] don't think they say exactly how much
[00:29:36] however assuming it is enough which I am

[00:29:41] be very
[00:29:43] strong but

[00:33:02] was their best trailer yet I'm not even
[00:33:04] kidding I don't

[00:38:29] the Stream uh for now welcome to the
[00:38:32] stream very excited for Sparkle we
[00:38:34] talked about her a little uh I think
[00:38:36] tomorrow I'm going to be okay
[00:38:40] hi hello cry thanks for 300 bits uh I
[00:38:44] think tomorrow we're going to be
[00:38:45] streaming star rail as she's out maybe I
[00:38:48] don't okay I'm GNA play her when she's
[00:38:50] out on the Asia server on a viewers
[00:38:53] account uh I so I have
[00:38:59] one of our Chatters I've used this
[00:39:00] account before Giga Chad lets me use it
[00:39:03] thank you uh however he doesn't have
[00:39:05] inor Lune or sely or uh some other
[00:39:09] character I want to use with sparkle so
[00:39:12] I don't know if we'll use that account I
[00:39:14] might I I you know I could use QQ um but
[00:39:18] if not if there's someone in chat who's
[00:39:19] like for sure getting Sparkle and
[00:39:21] pre-formed and has good other characters
[00:39:24] you could DM me and I might use that
[00:39:25] instead but what uh either way like I'm
[00:39:28] okay with this account like uh uh uh
[00:39:30] thanks for letting me uh uh volunteering
[00:39:32] JS so we'll see um but has to be Asia
[00:39:35] server because I'm going to stream my
[00:39:38] account on na release maybe a bit later
[00:39:40] in the night but before then I'm going
[00:39:41] to do so I think Asia server I'm going
[00:39:44] to play Sparkle get some footage then
[00:39:47] end stream then uh upload the guide and
[00:39:49] then stream the na release on my account
[00:39:52] later like maybe not as it releases but
[00:39:53] like maybe later I think that's the plan
[00:39:56] first off start um there's some stuff I
[00:39:59] need to test when she's out so it might
[00:40:00] take a little bit but outside of that it
[00:40:02] should be
[00:40:05] fine yeah uh unfortunate that it will be
[00:40:08] slightly delayed but it is what it
[00:40:12] is you won't double stream I will maybe
[00:40:16] but if not I'll just alternatively I get
[00:40:18] the Asia footage off stream and then I
[00:40:20] live for the na release so it's one or
[00:40:22] the other are we getting Sparkle guide
[00:40:23] yes it's mostly recorded however I need
[00:40:26] the live Ser to come out so I can test
[00:40:27] some things so it's going to be a bit
[00:40:29] delayed compared to some other videos
[00:40:30] because it's going to be longer I think
[00:40:33] uh also I already talked for like 20
[00:40:35] minutes about speed tuning so it is what
[00:40:36] it
[00:40:38] is ah it's fine we don't I I have to
[00:40:42] dude I [ __ ] hate speed tuning it's
[00:40:44] not even bad on Sparkle but you'll see I
[00:40:45] can't we'll see it's not bad it's
[00:40:47] actually not bad on her cuz there's two
[00:40:50] ways to play her there's either you're
[00:40:52] like you're playing her normally or
[00:40:53] you're a [ __ ] dumbass and but I can't
[00:40:55] say that in the guide so I have to to
[00:40:56] cover both but let's just say that if
[00:40:58] you [ __ ] remove all your speed on a
[00:41:00] character I hate you I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:41:03] I just do I'm sorry I don't have to
[00:41:05] explain it but if you're I'm
[00:41:07] sorry my blade is zero speed so impact
[00:41:11] the dollar m a few days ago I don't know
[00:41:13] what weapon I should use should I use
[00:41:15] elegy or thundering pulse wait what oh
[00:41:19] oh this is a okay I see so you're trying
[00:41:22] to you're trying to make this a Yi or
[00:41:23] official thing again you're trying to
[00:41:25] make this a a Y versus official stun
[00:41:27] loock compilation I see what you're
[00:41:29] doing but I will not fall prey to your
[00:41:31] shenanigans I will I see through your
[00:41:34] ruse young one I see through it I see
[00:41:37] through
[00:41:40] it do you know what else I see through
[00:41:42] 400 resin sorry we have to do a Delo
[00:41:44] clear I have to do one Delo clear per
[00:41:46] stream to make sure the dute guide
[00:41:48] actually comes that's my my theory if we
[00:41:51] dute clear every stream then the delute
[00:41:53] guide will happen if I don't then it
[00:41:54] won't so we have to do
[00:41:57] clear uh however for fishal I recommend
[00:42:00] a damage bow like thundering pulse is
[00:42:09] good
[00:42:14] anyways we're going to play duuke in the
[00:42:17] second

[01:04:31] true dude okay okay unironically though
[01:04:35] unironically though unironically though
[01:04:38] unironically though if you have Faron
[01:04:41] and Shan Yun you're actually
[01:04:43] thriving it's like not even
[01:04:53] Co
[01:04:54] I he love breaking this with a pole

[01:05:31] thing that can stimulate me is [ __ ]
[01:05:32] resin let's going do for
[01:05:40] million is 180 ER enough for Shang
[01:05:44] Ling well my friend that depends on how
[01:05:46] much you're funneling with Bennett the
[01:05:48] team you sent has no DPS which means all
[01:05:51] you're going to be doing is pressing e
[01:05:52] on benett and swapping it to Shang link
[01:05:56] so you will get away with less
[01:06:09] energy minus one slice collab no no
[01:06:12] we're still doing it I just dude he got
[01:06:14] sick or something all good but like
[01:06:15] we're waiting like I'm ready let the
[01:06:17] record state that I'm ready let the
[01:06:20] record show that I'm ready let the
[01:06:23] record display that I'm ready let the
[01:06:26] mighty be
[01:06:32] humble Sparkle or
[01:06:35] Aron that's up to you my
[01:06:42] friend that's up to you my
[01:06:44] friend uh in the most honest way
[01:06:53] possible
[01:06:54] wow this is dog
[01:06:56] [ __ ] I think
[01:07:02] Sparkle uh looks pretty Peak I would
[01:07:05] definitely get her personally no matter
[01:07:07] like personally I would pull for her
[01:07:09] however purple-haired women is top five
[01:07:13] uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh types of
[01:07:15] characters out
[01:07:18] there but
[01:07:20] also uh a counterargument to Sparkle
[01:07:23] despite me liking her is that I
[01:07:26] genuinely this is my only star rail bad
[01:07:28] take I do not get any enjoyment out of
[01:07:32] getting a Harmony character that makes
[01:07:34] my team a bit stronger I'm never like
[01:07:35] wow this is so much like this is so
[01:07:39] fun that's just not me like I'm not like
[01:07:41] yes I got an a skill point yes but to
[01:07:46] each their
[01:07:49] own like it makes you a lot stronger
[01:07:52] like Ron May literally breaks the
[01:07:53] [ __ ]
[01:07:55] game
[01:08:00] however again since I'm saying my only
[01:08:02] bad take I will keep going uh given the
[01:08:05] context of not necessarily power
[01:08:07] creeping but releasing strong units that
[01:08:09] often times can be stronger than other
[01:08:11] slots for example bronia being the meta
[01:08:13] and then we get Ron May and now we're
[01:08:14] getting Sparkle but we'll see how good
[01:08:15] Sparkle is uh there's a high chance that
[01:08:17] for harmony supports in the future what
[01:08:19] more can they [ __ ] do other than
[01:08:20] either action action advance or give you
[01:08:22] crit or give you attack or give you h or
[01:08:24] give you skill points So eventually the
[01:08:25] slot will be very contested and
[01:08:26] redundant and will probably play the
[01:08:28] same and or be better than the last
[01:08:29] character released so you should never
[01:08:31] really feel like you need a Harmony
[01:08:32] character whereas in like genin for
[01:08:33] example I think a lot of the supports
[01:08:35] are very valuable for a ton of teams
[01:08:36] it's the same in St but St also has more
[01:08:38] emphasis on DPS characters and you kind
[01:08:40] of feel like for me personally I feel
[01:08:42] like a lot of DPS characters have more
[01:08:44] like fun play Styles whereas a lot of
[01:08:46] the supports I just like I'm not
[01:08:48] thinking but characters that have action
[01:08:50] events do have forms of skill expression
[01:08:52] so uh you know insire me to farm maybe
[01:08:54] there's that was Sparkle anyways I don't
[01:08:58] even know what my answer is pull for
[01:09:02] both let the mighty be
[01:09:08] humble stay cool face your let's
[01:09:20] begin do you think we will have
[01:09:24] in the future and they could be anti D
[01:09:27] La
[01:09:34] CH true we need a a fouille geoc Caster
[01:09:38] as a playable character so you can Gio
[01:09:40] infus your team and then that will save
[01:09:42] Gio and don't even type Navia save Gio
[01:09:45] Navia saved herself Gio still [ __ ]
[01:09:47] drowning in a pool they can't even float
[01:09:50] na'vi is fine Gio still sucks penis
[01:09:56] and like this is coming from a guy who
[01:09:58] said Electro's been good even before
[01:10:00] dendel I don't give a [ __ ] Electro buff
[01:10:02] dendro sure I mean dendro buffed Electro
[01:10:04] sure but taser teams are still broken
[01:10:07] but Gio needs a [ __ ] uh I don't
[01:10:22] know that was your L take no sucr bet
[01:10:25] official SRO clears a lot of the new DPS
[01:10:29] well not new like it's not better than
[01:10:30] like nevet or like Alam but it clears a
[01:10:32] lot of characters still even after Gio
[01:10:35] it's still good it's just now you
[01:10:37] default to hyper blo like the default
[01:10:39] free to play team one of them I would
[01:10:40] recommend is just taser but now you just
[01:10:41] go hyper
[01:10:45] Bloom oh but you can't go hyper Bloom
[01:10:48] cuz you don't have em
[01:10:51] oh sorry I'm sorry
[01:10:59] thoughts on shiori um I'm going to be
[01:11:02] honest I have like no thoughts about
[01:11:04] chiori but surely when the stream
[01:11:07] happens I will have more thoughts
[01:11:12] now [ __ ] I canceled
[01:11:17] my I'm going to be honest boys I'm going
[01:11:19] to be honest and I'm an honest man um
[01:11:29] it's fine wrong set but all good uh I'm
[01:11:32] going to be honest and I'm an honest man
[01:11:36] uh they only drip marketed chiori so far
[01:11:39] for 4.5 either they're like hiding
[01:11:41] arlino or clarent or uh 4.5 will be uh a
[01:11:46] little bit sleeper until 4.6 that's all
[01:11:49] I'm going to say so hopefully they're
[01:11:51] like oh we we're saving this character

[01:19:36] strong box and then not just waste my
[01:19:38] resin but also waste my strong
[01:19:40] box bow
[01:19:50] your welcome to America brother
[01:19:53] [ __ ] where I
[01:19:56] see didn't you say I have pulls in woa
[01:19:59] we have like 50 pulls I'll do those
[01:20:00] after though near the end of the
[01:20:03] stream oh my
[01:20:09] God no I'm not saying
[01:20:17] anything Lugo thanks for tier one cry
[01:20:19] thanks for another 100 bits I appreciate
[01:20:20] it let me play some background music
[01:20:22] from playlist I don't know what I feel
[01:20:23] like listening to today what would this
[01:20:25] playlist give
[01:20:29] [Music]
[01:20:40] me I'm just going to shuffle everything
[01:20:50] whatever anyways if this stream had a
[01:20:53] song request dude if this stream Had
[01:20:55] song request it'd be over we would
[01:20:57] actually be [ __ ] we're just shuffling
[01:20:59] every playlist right now it's like 200
[01:21:01] songs so it'll be
[01:21:08] random Ena Daily chest not a bad idea
[01:21:11] but I don't know I said we could do Ena
[01:21:13] nomia next as the next region but Ena
[01:21:15] like is like demotivating like I farmed
[01:21:18] the kakomi island cuz I love kakomi so I
[01:21:20] did it I was motivated but [ __ ]
[01:21:23] something about economia it like drains
[01:21:25] me it like sucks the soul out of me I'm
[01:21:27] like this I would rather [ __ ] cry
[01:21:29] myself to
[01:21:37] sleep oh crit damage we can lock
[01:21:48] that I'll take Anka's goed okay the
[01:21:50] problem with Anka isn't
[01:21:53] exploring it it's if you explore it in
[01:21:55] bits and pieces cuz if you're there
[01:21:57] you're like immersed in like the oh
[01:21:58] daytime night time wao this little kid's
[01:22:01] [ __ ] family's dead whoa this like
[01:22:03] there's a nice story here well that was
[01:22:04] not a fun story but that you know like
[01:22:06] oh I'm immersed in the story right like
[01:22:09] okay cool but if you're like going and
[01:22:11] doing bits and pieces and you teleport
[01:22:13] there and then it's like sad [ __ ]
[01:22:14] Vibes and then it's like oh well you
[01:22:17] have to turn it today to get this one
[01:22:18] chest and then you have to like use a
[01:22:20] key and like go like jump into the
[01:22:22] [ __ ] pool it's like less
[01:22:25] friendly we already have a good feather
[01:22:27] so that is kind of oh my God oh my
[01:22:32] God this is good I'm not complaining but
[01:22:35] we don't need these pieces but it's good
[01:22:38] hey so why don't you farm a domain where
[01:22:39] you need every piece that's a good
[01:22:41] that's a good idea that's a good idea
[01:22:43] but unfortunately we chose this domain
[01:22:45] so I can't but these are good we'll
[01:22:47] level them these are good we'll level
[01:22:51] them yeah I've got good feather
[01:22:56] lock you are stupid
[01:22:59] dude why do you have to Flame me let me
[01:23:02] cut as resin first so we
[01:23:07] uncap also I think enough time has
[01:23:09] passed I can say it now first of all uh
[01:23:12] uh suu was Peak but the worst part by
[01:23:14] far is that the crafting table is in
[01:23:16] [ __ ] Narnia why do I have to run this
[01:23:18] far for a crafting table why it went
[01:23:21] from like best read to worst region cuz
[01:23:23] I have to use my whole stamina
[01:23:29] bar is Echo good if on 4050 ping I mean
[01:23:32] Echo is never good but it's fine on 40
[01:23:35] ping 4050 yeah I think under 100 like
[01:23:37] it's
[01:23:38] fine I don't actually know like
[01:23:41] quantifiably how much worse it is at
[01:23:43] higher ping I just know that the proing
[01:23:44] is like [ __ ] like sometimes it won't
[01:23:46] proc or some
[01:23:50] [ __ ] anyways let's level the pieces we
[01:23:52] got
[01:23:57] artifact Set uh will filter Echoes and
[01:24:01] Vermilion two emotes I mean emotes two
[01:24:04] sets what did we get that's good we got
[01:24:06] a flower and two feathers I think all
[01:24:10] right we'll start with the flow cuz
[01:24:11] nobody cares about the flow mineral
[01:24:13] mineral flat attack this is going to
[01:24:14] suck uh but we can waste our bad rolls
[01:24:17] here okay we can waste our bad rolls on
[01:24:20] this piece so give me [ __ ] flatty
[01:24:22] okay attack percent not
[01:24:25] bad what I have one star pieces okay
[01:24:29] another uh okay cr r that's
[01:24:38] good this piece is rolling scarily well
[01:24:41] when I wanted to waste bad rolls here
[01:24:43] but this is good
[01:24:47] um a little
[01:24:51] concerning
[01:25:02] okay that's fine uh it's still not bad
[01:25:05] like it can get like 12 crit rate which
[01:25:07] isn't bad uh or even
[01:25:12] 13 I mean if this has 13 crit rate I
[01:25:16] would use it I wouldn't use it but I
[01:25:19] would like to keep it for like a hahaah
[01:25:22] funny P socks
[01:25:26] ha no you wouldn't dude what about fav
[01:25:33] shenny would you actually use it
[01:25:35] probably not I'm
[01:25:38] coping okay let's all
[01:25:41] this you know you'd go no bless instead
[01:25:44] okay I actually run uh Shena on two
[01:25:47] Vermilion two Echoes to make it feel
[01:25:49] like it was worth going those sets even
[01:25:50] though Ness is better does that make
[01:25:52] sense let me set up straight my [ __ ]
[01:25:53] lower back has been hurting and I sit
[01:25:55] like a [ __ ] banana so anytime you see

[01:26:39] off piece could be good on uh on
[01:26:42] Vermilion with with with finina good on
[01:26:44] every single character in the game I
[01:26:45] predicted

[01:27:01] 8 times 1 2 3 4 five almost six rows of
[01:27:07] Vermillion plus 20
[01:27:09] pieces 8 * 6 is 48 minus one because
[01:27:13] this is a plus 16 four star that is

[01:27:47] me on this my goal is the next time I
[01:27:49] claim this trap and I I see myself face
[01:27:52] to face with the vermilia domain I have
[01:27:54] a moment of reflection I say hey maybe
[01:27:57] it's been enough and hopefully by that
[01:28:00] time my sh has gotten even better that
[01:28:03] is what I am hoping by placing it
[01:28:15] there that's a thing yes you got uh
[01:28:17] Crystal flies to it it's not the best
[01:28:19] but it's a it's it's honest work

[01:28:26] when she SS again she's like ah wait
[01:28:29] what is it
[01:28:31] fire never mind I don't remember attack
[01:28:35] that's what it is she says fire in
[01:28:37] Japanese I think I'm pretty
[01:28:39] sure let the mighty be humble and then
[01:28:43] and then Lenny's like it's
[01:28:45] showtime

[01:30:11] special what if this
[01:30:16] time I actually can't even think about

[01:31:08] run that's okay that's
[01:31:19] okay he the domain with eyes closed I
[01:31:21] think like I did that let the mighty be
[01:31:23] humble post the deluk guy you know what
[01:31:26] maybe maybe whoever's in charge of like
[01:31:29] giving us artifacts cuz every time you
[01:31:31] claim a domain I assume there's like
[01:31:32] someone manually choosing the artifact
[01:31:34] whoever that guy is let's call him uh
[01:31:36] let's call him uh uh uh Jonathan I think
[01:31:38] Jonathan is like waiting for me to
[01:31:40] release the deluk guide cuz he's a deluk
[01:31:42] man that is my my
[01:31:47] theory John impact oo that could be good
[01:31:51] I mean the sub stats other than crit
[01:31:52] damage suck but it could still be
[01:31:55] good I have one
[01:32:07] resin where is
[01:32:13] it chat if this gets uh 30 crit damage
[01:32:17] 500 gifted I'm not joking I don't care I
[01:32:19] don't care I'll % off damage just try
[01:32:24] asking kindly smiley
[01:32:29] face this could actually be good by the
[01:32:32] way this could actually be good if this
[01:32:35] gets oh wait that's good
[01:32:38] wait that's a Homa piece that's good
[01:32:42] that's good that's actually good I told
[01:32:45] you I'm not insane I told you verm
[01:32:48] million is is not copium it's it's an
[01:32:50] investment chat it's an investment it's
[01:32:53] an investment cuz you don't know until
[01:32:56] you know if if you there's if you dream
[01:32:59] things if you dream and you never pursue
[01:33:02] your dreams then your dreams are just
[01:33:04] dreams okay if if what think of what the
[01:33:07] world would be if LeBron James never
[01:33:10] picked up a basketball if Michael Phelps
[01:33:12] never jumped into a pool if Tiger Woods
[01:33:15] never picked up a golf club if Zio never
[01:33:18] entered Vermillion what would the world
[01:33:20] be like and so you have to not just
[01:33:23] dream but Chase your
[01:33:27] dream now we still want a crit like we
[01:33:30] still are more of a crit damage circlet
[01:33:33] user and we still need an anemo goblet
[01:33:35] and we could get a better flower but
[01:33:37] this is good and has ER actually a good
[01:33:39] piece not copia actually a good
[01:33:42] piece actually a good piece I'm not even
[01:33:45] coping Z
[01:33:47] 2024 true
[01:33:50] true

[01:34:01] ja let's see what it looks
[01:34:07] like I don't okay I mean this is a
[01:34:10] purely aasha piece cuz I don't need any
[01:34:13] ER like my sh needs literally zero ER
[01:34:16] but it's good for like so that people
[01:34:18] stop like typing ha zero ER but
[01:34:22] um [ __ ] is
[01:34:30] this ZX do you like poodge or aboba this
[01:34:34] is
[01:34:35] good peep Podge or

[01:41:16] searching or not
[01:41:19] loading bum bum
[01:41:22] [Music]
[01:41:33] Chad I started I low key cuz I don't
[01:41:36] have like that many Mutual games to play
[01:41:38] with z and genin isn't really a co-op
[01:41:40] game so I started playing um TFT with
[01:41:43] him is that weird is that
[01:41:45] cringe is that a cringe
[01:41:49] game
[01:41:52] no no not together he's been coaching me
[01:41:55] I went from unranked to Plat three in
[01:41:58] like 4
[01:42:00] days I'm gold bow down yeah nice
[01:42:14] try
[01:42:15] oh we are number
[01:42:18] 22 wait
[01:42:21] best sh in the world incoming also okay
[01:42:26] statistically speaking I can prove her
[01:42:28] number one I can prove we're number one
[01:42:29] high Fang I can prove we're number one
[01:42:31] because let's say we get 2% crit rate we
[01:42:34] would be number seven following that
[01:42:35] logic if we get 100 crit rate we would
[01:42:38] be number one and I have Shan Yun which
[01:42:41] gives me 100 like effectively 100 crit
[01:42:43] rate cuz she gives you 10 crit rate so
[01:42:45] I'm effectively number one number one
[01:42:49] sh yo number 22 though W or L Joy
[01:42:57] Emoji I see the value in my who's number
[01:43:00] one but I also see the meaning in all
[01:43:03] the Endeavors of the people of Fontaine
[01:43:05] dude this is I believe I will continue
[01:43:07] to take pride in fulfilling my duties
[01:43:10] I'm going to be
[01:43:12] honest this is
[01:43:15] like other than the sanss this is so
[01:43:18] cringe I know this sounds like cop but
[01:43:20] it's like random ER random random ER and
[01:43:24] then random ER and then it's like attack
[01:43:27] roll attack [ __ ] feather attack
[01:43:29] [ __ ] uh flower attack [ __ ]
[01:43:32] goblet attack ciret well it's not even
[01:43:34] that much attack this one's pretty
[01:43:36] good crit value Andy dude Shen Yun
[01:43:40] literally [ __ ] you if you use that
[01:43:41] build unironically going attack here is
[01:43:44] like griefing if Shan yun's here you're
[01:43:47] actually is shenyun no shun's not here
[01:43:49] if you play shenyun with a Pack set
[01:43:51] you're you're well not like set set but
[01:43:53] like sub stats you're griefing there's
[01:43:55] no way this isn't better or this or this
[01:43:59] or
[01:44:01] h no it C is
[01:44:05] better
[01:44:07] anyways what volume do you keep him at
[01:44:10] dude if you guys don't Max my volume do
[01:44:13] you even love

[01:44:19] honest
[01:44:26] I sing for yo Yow and I got Shia dude
[01:44:29] how does that even happen you literally
[01:44:30] get a free okay there's actually no
[01:44:32] excuse for that you get a free yoyo in
[01:44:34] Lantern right which was literally like
[01:44:36] two days ago so there's no excuse like
[01:44:38] I'm glad you got Chia he's great however
[01:44:41] there's no excuse for pulling on this
[01:44:43] Banner unless you want ya Yao cuz I mean

[01:45:19] sh does not have constellations other
[01:45:22] than C1 and C4 please do not pull for
[01:45:25] anything in the middle if you want to
[01:45:26] save Primo gems and maybe build his
[01:45:29] constellations one at a time put them in
[01:45:31] a fun say hey these 10,000 Primo gems
[01:45:33] 1,000 5,000 they're set aside for sh and
[01:45:36] then use your own self-control to not go
[01:45:39] under that amount and if you are too
[01:45:41] tempted to pull by every new character
[01:45:43] and can't keep your Primo gems for Shia
[01:45:45] then not only do you not love Shia
[01:45:47] enough but this is an exercise for you
[01:45:49] to exert self control and better
[01:45:51] yourself as a person and when you do
[01:45:53] better yourself as a person you'll come
[01:45:54] back to me you'll think about me you'll

[02:01:55] this
[02:01:59] up
[02:02:01] so let me explain some context as to why
[02:02:05] I'm reacting to this for a year now I
[02:02:09] haven't watched this video but for over
[02:02:11] a year I think two years I've mentioned
[02:02:13] this across different streams where I
[02:02:15] say genin like people say like oh they
[02:02:18] would waste have time on like endgame
[02:02:20] and stuff right and I always bring up
[02:02:22] certain events that they've had that
[02:02:24] basically were endgame but that they
[02:02:26] just didn't Implement right and I saw a
[02:02:29] video on my recommended called that one
[02:02:32] time when genon had its own simulated
[02:02:33] universe and it's literally the event
[02:02:36] I've been talking about and I also heard
[02:02:38] Z Jeff talk about it I've talked about
[02:02:39] this event like 10 times and there's
[02:02:42] actually a video on it so I want to
[02:02:44] watch it just because I feel like I
[02:02:46] don't know I don't know what this is I
[02:02:47] don't know if it's going to be good I'm
[02:02:48] going to pre preemptively like it I'm
[02:02:50] also going to link it in chat however I
[02:02:52] don't know if it's going to be good or
[02:02:53] bad but there's a chance that it it puts
[02:02:56] into words what I've been [ __ ]
[02:02:59] saying for years so we're going to watch
[02:03:04] it also
[02:03:09] Sparkle
[02:03:11] sorry best event dude it was so good but
[02:03:15] they just have to make it imagine they
[02:03:16] make it harder with rewards you could
[02:03:18] call with your friends boom it's
[02:03:20] actually Peak you actually wouldn't even
[02:03:23] getet dude getch would literally [ __ ]
[02:03:26] whip its [ __ ] out on every other type of
[02:03:28] content and game if they just if they if
[02:03:31] they just dude it's already the dev
[02:03:32] time's already done you just have to
[02:03:34] implement
[02:03:36] it I would do it I would literally
[02:03:39] enroll me in a coding program I'll learn
[02:03:41] it Envy for a game that's at least
[02:03:44] somewhat about amassing collections of
[02:03:46] attractive anime characters Envy is a
[02:03:48] feeling on so surprisingly limited
[02:03:49] display in the genin community C2 Ryden
[02:03:53] that's cool C6 albo King [ __ ] why does
[02:03:56] this start with Envy for every C6 R5
[02:03:58] character since release thanks for
[02:03:59] keeping the Servers Alive whale God Envy
[02:04:03] there's just not much of it until you
[02:04:04] start to compare one game with huny
[02:04:07] star's release was enough to make many
[02:04:08] genin players take to Reddit with rage
[02:04:11] in their Envy after years of dedication
[02:04:13] to genin starel released with a bunch of
[02:04:15] he's talking about you I'm not a whale
[02:04:18] years
[02:04:19] here's a small list replayable events
[02:04:21] permanent events true a multi-layered
[02:04:24] map a bigger stamina cap plus stamina
[02:04:26] overflow double drop rate events for
[02:04:28] artifacts salvageable artifact
[02:04:30] experience a more useful artifact strong
[02:04:32] box a photo mode that doesn't default to
[02:04:34] showing your uid a first-person camera
[02:04:36] that doesn't require a specific
[02:04:37] non-standard fourstar to use lip sync
[02:04:40] characters and dialogue for languages
[02:04:41] other than Chinese MC type changes don't
[02:04:43] require a trip to the Statue of 7
[02:04:45] resetting in memory of chaos doesn't
[02:04:46] force you to replay both sides and I'm
[02:04:48] sure there there's some I've missed and
[02:04:50] of course star rail launched with a big
[02:04:52] game mode simulated Universe an
[02:04:54] interesting variable repeatable endgame
[02:04:57] mode with good rewards it's something
[02:04:59] that gin impact players have wanted for
[02:05:02] years the lack of an endgame mode beyond
[02:05:04] the spiral Abyss was in fact a source of
[02:05:06] a huge controversy in October 2022 are
[02:05:09] there any plans to release new permanent
[02:05:12] content in the same vein as spiral abyss
[02:05:14] and ho versus why do I have to preface
[02:05:16] this video with everything else that's
[02:05:17] wrong just let me
[02:05:19] that are either at game or just enjoy
[02:05:21] combat or are trying to get to that
[02:05:23] level I know man it sucks don't remind
[02:05:25] me but can we talk about the event I'm
[02:05:29] sorry big slap in the face the game has
[02:05:33] for me like I feel like my my my
[02:05:35] favorite game just got murdered if
[02:05:36] you're looking forward to end game
[02:05:38] coming it is not so sure hope you like
[02:05:41] card games except genin impact did have
[02:05:45] it simulated Universe for one patch only
[02:05:47] we had a repeatable Rik game mode where
[02:05:50] we could clear challenging combat
[02:05:51] Chambers up and face down a wa wait I
[02:05:54] missed what this this was let me turn up
[02:05:57] up our party and face down a strong boss
[02:05:59] at the end well both teams and skill
[02:06:02] required the story of Labyrinth Warriors
[02:06:05] genin impacts alternative endgame That
[02:06:07] Never
[02:06:08] [Music]
[02:06:11] Was Labyrinth Warriors was the flagship
[02:06:14] event for
[02:06:16] genin sorry patch 2.2 a roguelike
[02:06:20] dungeon crawling event set in the Mystic
[02:06:22] Ono chamber a mysterious domain in
[02:06:24] inauma throughout the event you had to
[02:06:27] explore the shifting Mystic Ono chamber
[02:06:29] multiple times each with a different
[02:06:31] layout to explore and different sets of
[02:06:33] enemies to defeat at the beginning of
[02:06:34] your run you would select up to three
[02:06:36] shiky Fooda these were special okay no
[02:06:39] flame to the guy making this video
[02:06:40] actually no flame but you just swirled
[02:06:41] nothing you did a windy wind reaction
[02:06:42] ideally want to swirl an element with
[02:06:44] Kwa no big deal though no big deal the
[02:06:45] beginning of your run you would s up to
[02:06:47] three shiky Fooda these were special
[02:06:49] active abilities you could activate a
[02:06:51] limited number of times throughout your
[02:06:52] run to increase your damage healing
[02:06:54] resistance interruption or set up unique
[02:06:56] Elemental and team interactions plunge
[02:06:58] hoow anybody you explored two floors of
[02:07:01] the labyrinth in each run traversing
[02:07:02] room to room with just a simple map to
[02:07:04] help you find your way while it didn't
[02:07:06] take long to make it from one room to
[02:07:07] another there were traps to avoid
[02:07:09] Treasures to be found and twists and
[02:07:11] turns in the corridors to keep the
[02:07:12] exploration engaging treasure chest I'm
[02:07:14] telling you the dev time was already
[02:07:16] done it literally simulated my
[02:07:19] universim univ artifact poter and that
[02:07:22] dopamine hit genin players have grown
[02:07:23] addicted to there are also investigation
[02:07:26] points containing energy cabbages and
[02:07:29] damage cabbages I don't know if you want
[02:07:31] to include cabbages could spend on
[02:07:32] upgrades to make in the pr over time
[02:07:35] those traps I mentioned you really
[02:07:37] wanted to avoid those they could ruin
[02:07:38] your run if you weren't paying attention
[02:07:40] by simply exploding and killing your
[02:07:42] active character increasing the damage
[02:07:43] of all enemies or even preventing your
[02:07:45] characters from being healed or revived
[02:07:48] most rooms of the domain contained timed
[02:07:50] combat challenges after winning a battle
[02:07:52] you could pick one of three charms that
[02:07:54] is Buffs for your party in the video but
[02:07:58] apprciate challenge let the player
[02:07:59] choose between a serious encounter or a
[02:08:02] dire encounter choosing the more
[02:08:04] difficult dire encounter gave you more
[02:08:06] powerful Buffs to choose from over time
[02:08:09] your party would slowly become more
[02:08:11] powerful better equipping you for the
[02:08:12] boss rooms at the end of the labyrinth
[02:08:14] two floors bosss either featured Elite
[02:08:17] enemies with attendance support mobs
[02:08:19] that provide Buffs and healing to their
[02:08:20] boss or they featured powered up
[02:08:22] versions of genin's Overworld bosses
[02:08:24] these were challenging encounters pyro
[02:08:27] hypostasis
[02:08:30] well the vid yeah I have it here wait a
[02:08:33] second a roguelike dungeon mode where
[02:08:36] you fight battles to earn Buffs power up
[02:08:38] your team over time and fight a
[02:08:40] challenging boss at the end that's right
[02:08:42] it's the simulated universe or elisian R
[02:08:46] I have played honkai impact okay he
[02:08:48] anyways all of this was a massive breath
[02:08:50] of fresh air when compared to the sad
[02:08:52] state of the Spiral Abyss which players
[02:08:54] were complaining about even back in Fall
[02:08:56] 2021 when Labyrinth Warriors was in the
[02:08:59] game spiral abys has never been an
[02:09:01] especially beloved part of genin impact
[02:09:03] even combat oriented and hardcore
[02:09:05] players seem to find it lacking at best
[02:09:07] without much meat on the content bone to
[02:09:09] frustrating at worst when the abyss just
[02:09:11] refuses to give you that one attack buff
[02:09:13] you need to one cycle capellia but I
[02:09:15] have another theory as to why [ __ ] what
[02:09:18] the [ __ ] is this a is that a C6
[02:09:21] I have another theory as to why players
[02:09:24] seem to find at least C2 cuz the
[02:09:26] Whirlwind the presentation of the Spiral
[02:09:27] Abyss is just not up to par with the
[02:09:29] rest of the game presentation is one of
[02:09:31] genin's strongest suits the game is a
[02:09:34] visual Feast with a huge variety yo
[02:09:36] nobody get mad at me I have literally
[02:09:38] never seen this cuz my chasms at like 2%
[02:09:40] don't flame me I promise I play the game
[02:09:42] Landscapes and vibrant characters there
[02:09:45] are so many stunning visual reveals
[02:09:48] where feels like you've fallen into the
[02:09:49] game's concept art and don't forget the
[02:09:52] great voice acting and entertaining
[02:09:53] cutscenes whether they were rendered in
[02:09:55] engine or animated in genin's stunning
[02:09:58] stained glass 2D style and then you have
[02:10:00] the spiral Abyss in comparison it's at a
[02:10:02] tack-on location that you first get to
[02:10:04] Via an unexplained Wormhole as far as I
[02:10:07] remember the spiral Abyss itself is
[02:10:09] never mentioned in the game story or
[02:10:10] lore except for its own inside the abyss
[02:10:13] itself it's just a series of nondescript
[02:10:15] almost featureless flat Chambers there
[02:10:17] are staircases that imply you might be
[02:10:19] moving up or down yeah imagine you be 12
[02:10:22] you go up skirk is there [ __ ]
[02:10:24] tartaglia's whale and then you fight it
[02:10:27] boom floor 13 and then floor 14 is like
[02:10:29] even harder and then floor 15 instead of
[02:10:32] just being harder and harder they do
[02:10:33] something cool it's like an interesting
[02:10:35] change you have three teams of three oh
[02:10:37] that's cool and then when you're at the
[02:10:39] last chamber right 153 what you have to
[02:10:43] do is as soon as the the the timer ticks
[02:10:46] down and you start the combat a screen
[02:10:49] pops up you have to enter your credit
[02:10:50] card information within 15 seconds or
[02:10:52] you lose fire but the game Fades to
[02:10:54] Black the Nan you clear a chamber move
[02:10:56] on to the next floor via a menu or best
[02:10:59] popup rewards are distributed via menus
[02:11:01] too instead of a contextualized treasure
[02:11:03] chest even the music is uninspiring in
[02:11:06] comparison to the rest of genin there's
[02:11:07] a reason speedrunners pick their own
[02:11:09] down upes with their highle gameplay
[02:11:11] videos we're supposedly exploring a
[02:11:14] large and dangerous Tower and seizing
[02:11:16] its Treasures instead it feels like
[02:11:17] we're partaking in several
[02:11:19] inconsequential battles in a bubble
[02:11:21] Universe I know this seems like a bunch
[02:11:23] of small stuff but presentation goes a
[02:11:25] long way in heightening a player
[02:11:26] enjoyment of a gameplay experience
[02:11:28] ideally spiral Abyss would be a game
[02:11:30] mode that everybody wants to play
[02:11:32] because it's inherently fun not just
[02:11:34] because it provides significant amounts
[02:11:36] of ever scarce PR spiral Abyss fun sorry
[02:11:39] as it is the spiral Abyss is left
[02:11:41] feeling Half Baked which makes it stand
[02:11:43] out poorly in comparison craftsmanship
[02:11:46] that's gone into the rest of is like the
[02:11:47] combat system is like almost too good
[02:11:49] for the game it's like Abyss is I enjoy
[02:11:51] Abyss because I enjoy the combat system
[02:11:53] and like building characters but like
[02:11:54] imagine if they cuz the the way whoever
[02:11:57] designed the com system and all that
[02:11:58] [ __ ] it's like so good but then it's
[02:12:00] like the modes we have are so copium
[02:12:03] that like imagine if we had a fun game
[02:12:06] mode instead of Abyss or on top of Abyss
[02:12:09] right and the get to combat system dude
[02:12:11] it would be oh my God DS kit not
[02:12:14] withstanding I do realize that for Pure
[02:12:16] combat players the speed off by Fade to
[02:12:18] Black and menu transitions might be a
[02:12:20] plus but the Overworld is so easy for
[02:12:23] even pretty casual late game players
[02:12:25] that we're no no no hey I've been told
[02:12:28] not to ascend My World level so I don't
[02:12:30] know what you would call Easy okay
[02:12:32] situation where spiral Abyss is
[02:12:33] frustrating and boring while the
[02:12:35] Overworld combat is too easy and boring
[02:12:37] the spiral Abyss lacks the good
[02:12:39] presentation needed to make it more
[02:12:40] Wrong Enemy by the way that guy doesn't
[02:12:41] group to cuz there a shield that guy
[02:12:43] this guy runs to that guy doesn't so you
[02:12:44] should attack the other one by the way
[02:12:46] especially like want to enough content
[02:12:48] for hardcore players to sink their teeth
[02:12:50] into it's the worst of all worlds that
[02:12:54] casual player base is likely the core
[02:12:56] reason that genin impact hasn't added
[02:12:57] any more challenging endgame content
[02:12:59] genin impact has over 60 million
[02:13:04] act wait what is this January
[02:13:07] 2024 damn that's a lot of
[02:13:10] players
[02:13:12] damn of monthly players it is one of the
[02:13:15] single largest video games in the entire
[02:13:17] world
[02:13:19] while we can only guess as to the makeup
[02:13:21] of the player base's true habits hoyo
[02:13:23] does know the real answer and it is safe
[02:13:26] to assume that hoyse is an extremely
[02:13:28] datadriven company they wouldn't be
[02:13:30] sending us so many elaborate surveys if
[02:13:32] they weren't that said we can make some
[02:13:34] guesses based on hoo's behavior and some
[02:13:36] social media statistics YouTube videos
[02:13:39] even on relatively casual oriented
[02:13:41] content like guys tend to earn the
[02:13:42] biggest creators that's me wait why am I
[02:13:45] here 200,000 views at most spiral Abyss
[02:13:48] oriented content tends to perform less
[02:13:50] well than that my goat the ultimate
[02:13:53] Point here is that from what we can see
[02:13:55] less than 10% of the player base is
[02:13:57] consuming this video content of course
[02:14:00] this is the car content and the game is
[02:14:02] much bigger in China and some other most
[02:14:04] players are casual I guess that's point
[02:14:06] of players are watching video content in
[02:14:08] total but if less than onethird of the
[02:14:10] population are even looking at video
[02:14:11] guides to build their characters and
[02:14:13] less than that are looking at Abyss
[02:14:15] content how many are actually hearing
[02:14:17] the spiral Abyss my guess is not many
[02:14:20] I'd assert it's probable that only a
[02:14:22] minority of players 36 star the spiral
[02:14:25] Abyss hoo's behavior of deemphasizing
[02:14:27] the abyss and hard content in general is
[02:14:29] likely due to poor interest in that type
[02:14:31] of content
[02:14:32] remembering the abys and hard content in
[02:14:35] general is likely due to poor interest
[02:14:37] in that type of content remember the
[02:14:39] specific reason they gave in their 2022
[02:14:41] interview that ignited the controversy
[02:14:43] was this if we create another type of
[02:14:45] permanent endgame that is similar to
[02:14:47] spiral Abyss it might end up creating
[02:14:49] excessive anxiety for our not everyone
[02:14:51] is interested in mus grief excessive
[02:14:53] anxiety the anxiety caused by releasing
[02:14:56] a new archon with limited Ascension
[02:14:57] materials forcing us to rate each
[02:14:59] other's worlds if we didn't want to wait
[02:15:00] 2 weeks to Max her was acceptable
[02:15:02] anxiety anyways I think this is a bad
[02:15:05] reason to give up on endgame content
[02:15:07] instead hoyo should have developed an
[02:15:08] endgame mode that casual players will
[02:15:10] want to play and that hardcore players
[02:15:12] will still enjoy hint it's the simulated
[02:15:15] Universe the simulated universe is
[02:15:18] yeah
[02:15:19] like are you aware that the subreddit is
[02:15:22] Flaming you for
[02:15:25] stalling what is this I'll check it
[02:15:27] later
[02:15:29] uh the thing
[02:15:31] is
[02:15:33] what you linked me
[02:15:36] this anyways uh what the [ __ ] hoyo is
[02:15:41] going to make a Del guide eventually
[02:15:42] before Z updates
[02:15:44] his dude it's coming I promise it's
[02:15:48] coming I promise it's coming and like
[02:15:50] actually one of the next guyses uh okay
[02:15:53] regarding this this stuff like we talked
[02:15:55] about like over a year ago at this point
[02:15:57] but the the simulated universe is
[02:15:59] literally such a good mode and that it's
[02:16:01] like we had it we could have had it
[02:16:04] casual players will want to play and
[02:16:06] that hardcore players will still enjoy
[02:16:08] the only thing I don't like about
[02:16:08] civility universe is that I have to like
[02:16:11] Farm relics through it like something I
[02:16:12] don't feel like doing that but like
[02:16:14] outside of that it's sick it's the
[02:16:16] simulated Universe the simul universe is
[02:16:18] obviously designed to be played by all
[02:16:20] HSR players casuals and hardcore alike
[02:16:23] we can infer this from many parts of its
[02:16:25] design I hate simulated
[02:16:27] Universe of re
[02:16:29] sorry um I don't know the the the normal
[02:16:33] mode kind of gets easy SL repetitive
[02:16:35] after a bit but like golden gears swarm
[02:16:39] I don't know I don't care you guys
[02:16:40] cannot like it if you want that's your
[02:16:41] opinion you're entitled to it but I just
[02:16:43] think it's so sick cuz it's so like
[02:16:46] there's so many paths you can do this so
[02:16:47] much like depth to it imagine now
[02:16:49] imagine that and I I that's like I like
[02:16:52] starl and that's like one of the things
[02:16:53] I like the most about starl so no flame
[02:16:55] to starl at all but imagine if on top of
[02:16:57] that you
[02:16:59] could co-op with your friends and have
[02:17:01] elemental reactions and fight bosses in
[02:17:04] like a more like you're controlling your
[02:17:06] character type of way right and don't
[02:17:08] get me wrong no disrespect to simil
[02:17:11] Universe I think it's sick however
[02:17:14] imagine if what we could have had most
[02:17:17] importantly that it's the only source of
[02:17:18] planer relics which you must put on your
[02:17:21] characters to even have a casual build
[02:17:23] additionally it's a renewable source of
[02:17:26] freeo playay friendly light cones and
[02:17:28] most importantly Stellar Jades and these
[02:17:30] rewards are 100% achievable for even the
[02:17:33] Casual player who doesn't have the skill
[02:17:35] or characters built well enough to
[02:17:37] successfully clear a run every time the
[02:17:39] points are cumulative so they just have
[02:17:41] to attempt an extra run or two to get
[02:17:43] the max rewards this is in stark
[02:17:45] contrast to memory of chaos or spiral
[02:17:47] Abyss which is a strict DPS check you
[02:17:49] must have the skill and gear required to
[02:17:51] full clear or you will miss out on the
[02:17:53] very valuable pulling currency
[02:17:55] furthermore the Rog likee nature of the
[02:17:57] simulated Universe with plentiful Buffs
[02:17:59] and curios available to power up your
[02:18:00] team deemphasizes the gear check element
[02:18:03] of the Abyss game modes instead the game
[02:18:05] mode is more about picking the right
[02:18:07] Buffs for your team and the situation
[02:18:09] the Buffs are way more powerful and
[02:18:10] impactful than the relics on your
[02:18:12] characters this again makes it more
[02:18:14] accessible to Casual players who might
[02:18:16] not have or even know how
[02:18:19] to comforta Cle strong gear will make it
[02:18:22] a lot easier maybe even trivial for
[02:18:24] hardcore players but at least the
[02:18:25] variety of paths in the simulated
[02:18:27] Universe provide good opportunities for
[02:18:29] replay through experimentation should a
[02:18:31] hardcore player get bored of insta
[02:18:32] killing everything most importantly the
[02:18:34] simulated Universe has good presentation
[02:18:37] instead of being dropped into a
[02:18:38] featureless chamber with no context we
[02:18:40] revisit cdor of Worlds we've experienced
[02:18:43] okay this might be a little copium I
[02:18:45] kind of like the Eerie I don't know what
[02:18:47] the context is behind the abyss that is
[02:18:50] a little copium but outside of that I
[02:18:51] agree and the music are usually
[02:18:53] contextualized to the area where
[02:18:55] simulating which makes it a lot more
[02:18:56] visually and orally interesting than
[02:18:58] what spiral Abyss has to offer one of
[02:19:00] the first updates hoyo made to the
[02:19:02] simulated Universe in the live game was
[02:19:04] to improve a facet of its presentation
[02:19:06] remember these weird little spheres us
[02:19:09] for simulated Universe events at launch
[02:19:11] they were quite Bland the choice to
[02:19:12] remove these spheres and instead drop a
[02:19:14] painting with the events relevant
[02:19:16] artwork into the world a great idea the
[02:19:18] appearance of one of those paintings is
[02:19:20] eye-catching and gets a reaction from
[02:19:21] you before you get there it's pretty
[02:19:24] hyped to enter An Occurrence area to see
[02:19:25] Ron May's painting floating there lastly
[02:19:28] y don't eat her cated Universe features
[02:19:31] an aspect of traversal however basic it
[02:19:33] may be while there
[02:19:35] is the need for forward movement with
[02:19:37] enemies in the way and destructible
[02:19:39] objects to interact with helps you feel
[02:19:41] a distinct sense of progress as you
[02:19:43] literally progress forward through the
[02:19:45] simulated Universe traversal and explor
[02:19:47] exporation are two of the most important
[02:19:49] gameplay elements of genin impact and
[02:19:51] they are both completely missing from
[02:19:53] its endgame but they are represented
[02:19:55] however lightly in Star rail simulated
[02:19:57] Universe the lavish open world is
[02:19:59] obviously where a lot of Dev time and
[02:20:00] money is going and it works exploration
[02:20:03] and gion impact is a ton of fun for me
[02:20:06] opening chests is as rewarding and
[02:20:08] addicting 3 years later as it was at the
[02:20:10] start of the game it's this open World
[02:20:12] gameplay Loop that likely keeps a lot of
[02:20:13] genin's casual player based world are
[02:20:16] just insanely popular in the gaming
[02:20:18] market and hoyo keeps giving us more
[02:20:20] incredible open world content to enjoy
[02:20:22] so ideally in endgame mode that appeals
[02:20:24] to both casuals and hardcore players
[02:20:26] would tie the game's exploration and
[02:20:28] Combat gameplay together guess what
[02:20:30] there's already content that does that
[02:20:32] super well in the game it's these
[02:20:34] challenge domains that are scattered
[02:20:35] throughout I've been saying this this
[02:20:37] guy's a SS viewer welcome to the stream
[02:20:39] I true I've been saying the reason I
[02:20:42] played this [ __ ] game was cuz I did
[02:20:44] the one with like Lisa and like Amber
[02:20:45] that I was like yo I can't wait to go
[02:20:47] back and do the Temple of the Falcon
[02:20:49] with my friends I literally I grinded to
[02:20:52] co-op ar16 day one before going to bed I
[02:20:54] stayed up all night I remember and then
[02:20:56] I was literally like oh I can't wait to
[02:20:58] redo this with my friends and then I
[02:21:00] kept looking it up and I turned out you
[02:21:01] can't could you imagine the Overworld
[02:21:05] these Standalone dungeons provide
[02:21:07] genin's exploration experience on a
[02:21:08] miniaturized scale while also providing
[02:21:11] frequent and fun combat these have sadly
[02:21:14] less complex as time is gone I'm sure
[02:21:16] they had an original idea I'm just
[02:21:17] saying I agree this is there are zero of
[02:21:20] them in Fontaine and several of the ones
[02:21:22] in suu consisted of simple one room
[02:21:24] combat challenges but when they're done
[02:21:26] well they provide really awesome
[02:21:27] experiences and that's basically what
[02:21:29] the core of Labyrinth Warriors was they
[02:21:31] were extended domains with a greater
[02:21:33] emphasis on combat but with strong
[02:21:35] presentation exploration and traversal
[02:21:37] to make the mode more engaging
[02:21:38] entertaining and immersive there were
[02:21:40] even treasure chests to find and open
[02:21:42] along the way it's a game mode that
[02:21:43] managed to tie all of genin's gameplay
[02:21:45] elements team building traversal
[02:21:48] into one excellent little package it was
[02:21:51] by far the single best combat event they
[02:21:53] have ever given us and like the
[02:21:55] simulated Universe Labyrinth
[02:21:58] Warriors for casuals and fun for
[02:22:01] hardcore players by putting a greater
[02:22:02] emphasis on powering up your teams
[02:22:04] through the available Buffs I'm really
[02:22:06] not kidding when I say this game mode
[02:22:07] was just simul all right guys I will
[02:22:10] release a delute guide if it
[02:22:13] means if it means stopping whoever's
[02:22:16] playing in this video from going
[02:22:17] sacrificial sword great sword on theable
[02:22:21] I'm really not kidding when I say this
[02:22:22] game mode was just simulated Universe
[02:22:24] inchin impact there's a reason these Rog
[02:22:27] likee game modes are in every other one
[02:22:28] of toyo's games they're really fun and
[02:22:30] work really well it's frankly weird that
[02:22:33] they haven't to bring it to gench in is
[02:22:34] permanent content especially because
[02:22:36] they already did the work Labyrinth
[02:22:38] Warriors exists it could be put back
[02:22:40] into the game right now just by tweaking
[02:22:42] the UI changing enemy lineups and
[02:22:44] balancing some Buffs but it could even
[02:22:46] be so much more the domains in the event
[02:22:48] were brilliantly themed to Ena Zuma but
[02:22:51] there are a lot more domain themes
[02:22:53] they've introduced since then more than
[02:22:55] one for each region they could likely
[02:22:56] create some sort of procedural
[02:22:58] generation system for each terrain set
[02:23:00] match the theme of The Domain to a new
[02:23:02] set of enemies you choose every week or
[02:23:04] create multiple
[02:23:05] worlds in it simulated Universe it would
[02:23:08] be a lot of fun to explore new varied
[02:23:10] domains and face down challenging
[02:23:12] enemies every week hell why not put some
[02:23:15] beefed up weekly bosses in there they
[02:23:17] could make asaha or even storm Terror
[02:23:19] real challenging fight okay uh no
[02:23:22] disrespect but I've seen Reddit threads
[02:23:25] and people you know just people
[02:23:26] complaining about oaha to a great extent
[02:23:29] so maybe including him again might not
[02:23:31] be the best idea but I like where you're
[02:23:32] going with that you know could make
[02:23:34] asaha or even storm Terror real
[02:23:37] challenging fights again genin's
[02:23:38] gameplay is so much fun that there is of
[02:23:40] course all this potential to do stuff
[02:23:42] with a new endgame mode unfortunately it
[02:23:45] seems like hoyse has settled with get
[02:23:47] gen's end game as is despite all the
[02:23:49] blowback from he's gone bro he's gone
[02:23:52] they haven't done anything genin impact
[02:23:54] is a casual game that's how hoyo seems
[02:23:56] to think but I think a game mode like
[02:23:58] this like the simulated Universe can
[02:24:00] strike the appropriate balance
[02:24:02] approachable for casuals fun for
[02:24:04] hardcore it already exists Toyo put it
[02:24:07] back in the
[02:24:09] game Dam that's
[02:24:11] [Music]
[02:24:16] [ __ ]
[02:24:17] [Music]
[02:24:25] Banger that pretty
[02:24:28] good I agree with most of
[02:24:30] that
[02:24:37] um yeah I the thing is it's
[02:24:42] like the event was like literally if you
[02:24:45] played it like yeah yeah it could have
[02:24:47] been better like there could have been
[02:24:48] like better like skate like you know
[02:24:51] events like these are always super fun
[02:24:52] and then as soon as they start getting
[02:24:54] challenging they end so like if it was
[02:24:56] expanded upon it would be like really
[02:24:58] good so that which is also why even like
[02:25:01] the the domains is another thing I say
[02:25:02] where it's like this is like Dev time
[02:25:04] that's already done it's like it
[02:25:06] wouldn't take the Morad stuff but it's
[02:25:08] never going to happen I can link the it
[02:25:10] again it's never going to happen
[02:25:12] because not only is the main player base
[02:25:15] casual but also which is fine but still
[02:25:19] there shouldn't there should be
[02:25:20] content even to play with your friends
[02:25:22] or even if it's solo like something to
[02:25:25] do more than just grinding resin um
[02:25:29] because it would even make the money but
[02:25:30] I already explained that I'm not going
[02:25:31] to go into it again but it would make
[02:25:32] the money if you're making people play
[02:25:34] more and like want to uh be able to
[02:25:36] clear something that they can't clear or
[02:25:38] get something that's whatever cool but
[02:25:40] also it's
[02:25:41] like the game was designed assuming you
[02:25:44] don't have friends like that's like the
[02:25:46] like motto behind it it's like yeah like
[02:25:48] you know look at all these [ __ ] wuss
[02:25:51] that like you and it's like so it's like
[02:25:54] I doubt the co-op system will be
[02:25:56] expanded on which is my biggest uh gripe
[02:26:00] or
[02:26:03] annoyance but it's not like dude like
[02:26:05] there's so many ways like they could
[02:26:07] [ __ ] promote Hool lab make it like a
[02:26:09] matchfinder or what [ __ ] I don't know
[02:26:11] like there's ways to like find players
[02:26:13] to play with and even outside of that a
[02:26:15] lot of that stuff could be solo
[02:26:18] too but
[02:26:29] anyways MMO players don't have a life
[02:26:31] but they Co-op okay well the thing is I
[02:26:33] actually was talking to zra about this
[02:26:35] the most casual MMO player is like the
[02:26:39] hardcore genin player like that's where
[02:26:40] the overlap is not like the most casual
[02:26:43] but like casual like that's like the
[02:26:44] overlap which is why it's like very
[02:26:48] not probable that they add stuff for
[02:26:51] hardcore players even though I think
[02:26:52] they
[02:26:53] should but like there's also many
[02:26:56] reasons why it would make money for them
[02:26:58] to do it as long as they do it correctly
[02:27:00] cuz like it it's it could be scalable
[02:27:02] difficulties and stuff that people want
[02:27:04] so like it wouldn't like scare them away
[02:27:06] yeah you might not be able to clear the
[02:27:07] [ __ ] last floor if you're playing
[02:27:09] like a no artifact shinen but like
[02:27:11] should you be able to clear the entire
[02:27:12] game if you're doing that in my opinion
[02:27:14] no it shouldn't be whale content I you
[02:27:16] should be able to with like a fourstar
[02:27:18] but like you know you should know what
[02:27:19] you're doing but
[02:27:23] anyways you can't do anything in
[02:27:24] multiplayer like Quest yeah I
[02:27:28] agree I wish exp like yeah
[02:27:34] yeah it's
[02:27:42] fine does g not do twitch DRS yes this
[02:27:45] twitch drops every new like patch and
[02:27:46] stuff stuff so like there were some for
[02:27:48] shenyun uh I think tomorrow when I
[02:27:50] stream star rail there's going to be
[02:27:51] star Rail drops genin's going to have
[02:27:53] some again probably for the next charact
[02:27:54] like the next
[02:27:56] patch but they just ended they usually
[02:27:59] end they're usually for the first half
[02:28:00] of the banner like the first Banner this
[02:28:02] draw all time and then second half
[02:28:03] there's none that's usually what it's
[02:28:05] like I think wait will sell even get
[02:28:06] some then cuz Sparkle's second half
[02:28:08] maybe Sparkle won't even have some I
[02:28:09] don't even
[02:28:14] know maybe I don't know
[02:28:20] I thought it was depending on who was
[02:28:21] sponsored no the the like follow for
[02:28:23] drops or like my channel has drops is
[02:28:26] usually clickbait sometimes they'll be
[02:28:28] like sponsored like I've I've given like
[02:28:30] a sponsored code for like 60 Jades once
[02:28:33] that happens but for the most part it's
[02:28:35] just
[02:28:36] like if drops are enabled everyone
[02:28:38] enables it unless you like actively
[02:28:40] don't enable drops on your channel
[02:28:45] but
[02:28:47] why is he in the chasm why are you in
[02:28:52] the kitchen eating food yeah what now
[02:28:56] why are you eating yeah [ __ ] swallow
[02:28:59] come on you have [ __ ] to do stop [ __ ]

[02:29:56] helpful calculations from the shain's
[02:29:58] Discord shout out to them for that and
[02:30:00] as you can see here C4 Bennett is a
[02:30:02] pretty good option it's not part of the
[02:30:04] dream team but it's a good it's it's a
[02:30:06] good
[02:30:07] choice it's a good
