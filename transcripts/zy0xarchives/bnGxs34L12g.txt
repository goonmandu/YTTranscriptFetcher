[00:15:55] [ __ ] her camera angle which is annoying
[00:15:58] um what do I do in the downtime I can't
[00:16:00] Auto attack what the [ __ ] do I do

[00:16:37] um
[00:16:42] um it's fine actually honestly look at
[00:16:45] how much time we have left this is

[00:16:51] that this guy dies yep okay it's it's
[00:16:54] doable it's
[00:16:55] doable oh no it's not doable it's
[00:16:57] actually not doable okay I I need to
[00:17:00] replace one of these
[00:17:05] characters more ER yeah I could go for
[00:17:07] more oh my God I can't do anything I
[00:17:09] actually can't do anything I have like
[00:17:11] so much
[00:17:16] downtime yeah can you imagine if I got
[00:17:18] my like burst back
[00:17:23] there uh yeah okay
[00:17:29] okay we might need more damage but how
[00:17:31] do I do
[00:17:34] that what unit
[00:17:37] fits it's like
[00:17:43] none just kill them faster
[00:17:48] true okay I have an
[00:17:50] idea I have an idea yeah I have an idea
[00:17:53] I have an
[00:17:55] idea guys I can't Auto attack I cannot
[00:17:58] Auto attack
[00:17:59] aloy is technically a is she a five
[00:18:05] star I mean Chong yun's better than aloy
[00:18:08] anyways Chong yun's literally
[00:18:09] better uh the problem with Chong is I
[00:18:14] don't know if he's better than Verdes
[00:18:17] inv
[00:18:18] Venter
[00:18:20] uh and
[00:18:22] also we could use a five star like if I
[00:18:25] can't do this with four stars I will use
[00:18:27] five stars okay I'm not on the fourar
[00:18:29] idea but I want to try four
[00:18:34] stars yeah singu does not
[00:18:37] work
[00:18:40] um I
[00:18:43] mean honestly like Chong's not bad Chong
[00:18:48] Yan's a pretty good unit it's just his e
[00:18:52] doesn't really do anything it's
[00:18:53] literally just his

[00:19:47] when I can't Auto attack unless I have
[00:19:49] to use five star characters I might use
[00:19:51] five stars but I want to try not
[00:19:53] to be honest be honest you think you
[00:19:56] think I can do it with Chong with Mr

[00:21:05] change my Sands to a blizzard stray your
[00:21:09] Sands boom this one right uh and then my
[00:21:13] ratio is now sh Wait okay
[00:21:19] wait
[00:21:22] um okay I just run uh I just run this
[00:21:25] and now I get more energy recharge my
[00:21:26] ratio is now [ __ ] okay that's a lot
[00:21:29] better and we noticed in the last run in
[00:21:31] the last run aquab thanks for the eight
[00:21:33] months we noticed where is he z0x look
[00:21:38] z0x hi

[00:24:58] did it good enough first try okay now
[00:25:02] this is the half that I'm scared of I
[00:25:03] don't know if this is doable but we'll
[00:25:06] see so we go over here we start with
[00:25:10] Chong e then I go barar to freeze him
[00:25:13] then Ka
[00:25:15] that that then this then that okay this
[00:25:19] is so far so good I stay close to him to
[00:25:21] make sure he freezes chun's e cool down
[00:25:23] is 6 years I did not know
[00:25:25] that uh can I do that
[00:25:29] that that catch the particles okay I
[00:25:32] didn't get my
[00:25:34] burst this actually good damage dude my
[00:25:37] Kai needs more ER why am I not getting
[00:25:39] my
[00:25:44] burst okay Chong Yan tell him wa maybe I
[00:25:47] should level my Chong Yan whatever it's
[00:25:49] fine good damage good damage y so far so
[00:25:52] good so far so good uh this should kill
[00:25:54] him yeah okay where's the next
[00:25:56] enemy if only I could [ __ ] turn my
[00:26:01] camera um do
[00:26:07] that so far so good so far so good okay
[00:26:10] look at this damage you wish you could
[00:26:12] do this much
[00:26:16] okay okay dude crowd characters are
[00:26:18] actually broken I'm not even kidding
[00:26:19] like crowd characters are actually just
[00:26:21] op catch particles on K oh I didn't get
[00:26:23] my burst this is going to be close this
[00:26:26] is going to be close why are we
[00:26:27] struggling so much to the easiest
[00:26:28] chamber it's fine I got this
[00:26:32] um good damage good
[00:26:34] damage we got this we actually got
[00:26:37] this bro die die no
[00:26:42] die let's
[00:26:45] go let's go okay that was the easiest
[00:26:48] chamber I still don't know if we can do
[00:26:50] all of this with four stars only but for
[00:26:53] now that's a dub all right I'm going to
[00:26:55] use my mouse now that's a dub that's a
[00:26:58] dub
[00:27:01] okay uh Elemental burst damage this is
[00:27:03] actually huge this card might actually
[00:27:04] just change
[00:27:05] everything this changes everything I'm
[00:27:08] sorry all right we picked the card Mouse
[00:27:10] is now
[00:27:13] discarded um
[00:27:15] okay I'm going to be honest just a
[00:27:17] disclaimer before you watch this next
[00:27:19] section magu keni is hard he can one-hot
[00:27:21] you if you don't Dodge or use your burst
[00:27:23] properly it's hard for me with this
[00:27:25] camera angle to not die magui might
[00:27:27] literally take hours so just you're not
[00:27:29] allowed to laugh kek W is banned any
[00:27:32] laughing emote is banned just it's going
[00:27:35] to be hard okay but oh and then after
[00:27:39] there's the [ __ ] mirror maidens bro
[00:27:40] oh
[00:27:42] my all right let's go first try we got
[00:27:48] this scroll
[00:27:52] out okay no more Mouse now that's not a
[00:27:55] bad call okay
[00:27:58] wait it zoomed back
[00:28:00] in it literally zooms you back in cuz
[00:28:03] she's too small look
[00:28:07] look it literally zooms you back does it
[00:28:10] not yeah it
[00:28:12] does so it doesn't
[00:28:15] matter okay whatever anyways let's just
[00:28:17] go no
[00:28:18] mouse uh now the problem is I use my
[00:28:20] pyron very early so now what I'm going
[00:28:22] to do is give my shling particles by
[00:28:25] doing this and I'm going to use my Pyon
[00:28:27] right before the buff expires yeah
[00:28:29] perfect do that swap the saou I can't
[00:28:32] even Dodge I literally have to tank
[00:28:34] his wait this damage is sick okay how am
[00:28:37] I going to dodge this attack though oh I
[00:28:39] guess I can just dodge with shift yeah
[00:28:40] I'm kind of stupid but like on saou you
[00:28:42] can't really
[00:28:45] Dodge do that oh my God this damage is
[00:28:48] this damage
[00:28:50] is
[00:28:52] okay perfect timing perfect timing yep
[00:28:56] oh my God dude this is faster than my
[00:29:00] Hut oh wait do okay swap the Shang Ling
[00:29:04] boom swap the official get some overload

[00:29:10] saw you oh my god dude she's short she
[00:29:13] should be able to duck
[00:29:18] under oh wow I dodg that
[00:29:21] perfectly oh my God I need particles
[00:29:23] nice boom boom swap official Dodge okay
[00:29:27] I didn't dodge it's
[00:29:29] fine oh my God 20K per
[00:29:33] Pyon this making me dizzy dude this good
[00:29:36] this good this
[00:29:39] good let's go yo that was
[00:29:44] huge this com is called Hot Wheels
[00:29:46] what's up kaching Ms yeah that com is
[00:29:49] fun okay this is the hard part because
[00:29:52] typically when you fight these enemies
[00:29:54] you can group them together with an
[00:29:55] anemo unit but I don't have one so I
[00:29:57] literally don't don't know how I'm
[00:29:58] supposed to do this if anyone in chat
[00:30:00] knows a way to group these enemies up
[00:30:01] let me know because if not I'm just
[00:30:03] going to have to brute force it also I
[00:30:04] think cryon Mage has a lot of cryo
[00:30:06] resistance but
[00:30:08] anyways just kill them ventti Al okay
[00:30:12] yeah that's not
[00:30:13] helpful uh this is why I wanted to run
[00:30:15] sucros in this team
[00:30:17] but
[00:30:19] yeah go in the middle okay guys if I
[00:30:23] have to reset I am going to have to use
[00:30:27] saou again oh my God wait okay here's
[00:30:30] why I can't go in the middle if I go in
[00:30:31] the middle I can't even break the cison
[00:30:33] shield oh my okay I'm speedrunning [ __ ]
[00:30:36] it I have to Perma freeze her if I Perma
[00:30:37] freeze her she can't get the shield up
[00:30:39] this is the plan we kill her before she
[00:30:41] can breathe oh my God oh my God oh my
[00:30:43] God just kill her just kill her just
[00:30:45] [ __ ] kill her I don't care about
[00:30:46] anything
[00:30:49] else oh my God oh my God oh my God I'm
[00:30:52] going to break my keyboard I mean my
[00:30:53] space bar do that
[00:30:56] K oh my god oh oh my God no no no she's
[00:30:58] going to get the shield oh no no no no
[00:31:00] no oh no don't get the shield guys oh my
[00:31:05] God she's going to get the shield oh my
[00:31:06] God oh my God Barber e bar she's Frozen
[00:31:08] Wait this
[00:31:12] huge dude
[00:31:19] dude I'm getting Perma Frozen
[00:31:28] um um we do that then we do this then we
[00:31:32] do that
[00:31:35] okay okay she didn't get the shield out
[00:31:37] that's really good uh but I have C6
[00:31:40] Barbara I have C6 barara it's fine oh
[00:31:42] it's fine it's actually fine it's
[00:31:43] actually fine okay um now I don't know
[00:31:46] how I'm going to kill the next I don't
[00:31:47] even have time
[00:31:48] okay maybe freeze team's not the
[00:31:51] play uh
[00:32:00] unless I can kill this cyon in 14
[00:32:03] seconds a freeze comp may or may not be
[00:32:09] ideal
[00:32:16] yeah [ __ ] we got so far okay I'm not
[00:32:19] going to give up yet I might
[00:32:25] retry like this damage isn't bad we just
[00:32:27] have to kill the the cryocon Mage but I
[00:32:29] don't know how to do
[00:32:31] that let's just look at the units we
[00:32:33] have would freeze work on first half
[00:32:36] probably not cuz there's the magu Ki and
[00:32:38] the maguk Ki cannot be
[00:32:40] frozen so we would need an anemo unit or
[00:32:44] a other
[00:32:47] reaction now the problem
[00:32:50] is oh what if we use the main character
[00:32:55] uh anemo MC and we grouped them with her
[00:32:56] Alt
[00:32:59] that could work but freeze would still
[00:33:02] kind of
[00:33:02] suck against those enemies so we might
[00:33:05] have to run
[00:33:06] like um five star bro it's still a
[00:33:09] [ __ ] four star calm down it's still a
[00:33:12] come on it's like a freeo
[00:33:16] play show the stats of the cas comp I
[00:33:19] have a build on every character I use so
[00:33:24] yeah MC F star match bro
[00:33:28] whatever
[00:33:30] uh I
[00:33:33] mean we could use Amber quick swap
[00:33:36] melt what about sucros so sucros is what
[00:33:39] I used initially but the problem with
[00:33:41] sucros was I didn't have enough I didn't
[00:33:43] have enough Firepower to clear the first
[00:33:45] half cuz sugr doesn't help that much
[00:33:47] against the first few
[00:33:50] enemies um Chong Yun it gives a lot more
[00:33:55] damage but
[00:34:05] yeah we might have to use like [ __ ]
[00:34:07] Jean
[00:34:08] bro no dude I mean we can try we can try
[00:34:15] MC SEC not enough em Noel dude I can't
[00:34:19] Auto attack I I need I I need a
[00:34:21] character I need a character who cannot
[00:34:23] Auto attack MC would work uh but the
[00:34:26] problem is
[00:34:29] I don't know if Kaa Rosaria is enough
[00:34:32] damage
[00:34:35] like I kind of like yeah you know what
[00:34:38] I'm saying like Kai roosara kind of
[00:34:41] don't do damage also sing Tru might be
[00:34:44] better than Barbara cuz don't his rain
[00:34:46] swords apply a bit h no no not really no
[00:34:49] they don't apply that much I mean it
[00:34:50] applies wet around
[00:34:53] him is it enough can you apply enough
[00:34:55] Hydro on sing Chu just from your hydro
[00:34:57] swords
[00:35:01] like your rain swords without Autos they
[00:35:04] can break oh yeah they can rain swords
[00:35:07] apply every 2.25
[00:35:13] seconds not as much as
[00:35:16] Barbara no healer I don't need a Healer
[00:35:18] in a freeze team
[00:35:21] though okay actually I probably need to
[00:35:23] healer I'm kind of stupid
[00:35:28] ah dude okay
[00:35:32] chat adjust your ping okay listen I
[00:35:35] could run cuz singu gives more damage
[00:35:37] than Barbara singu is e cuz I can't Auto
[00:35:39] attack on Barbara so I'm just using her
[00:35:41] for healing if I use singu I get like
[00:35:44] 20,000 per e that's basically Chong
[00:35:46] yun's damage even if I don't Auto attack
[00:35:49] I get Chong yun's damage and singu heals
[00:35:51] a
[00:35:52] little so we could run a s true
[00:35:55] build uh where I run him him
[00:35:58] on like sack sword
[00:36:03] and didn't Rosaria just die Ros did
[00:36:06] pretty
[00:36:07] good okay let's just gear this really
[00:36:09] fast I'll run two Hydro to no blast
[00:36:12] probably nice G Pro super light there Mr
[00:36:15] socks I like that setup drip yeah I like
[00:36:19] the super light it looks cool I mean
[00:36:20] it's also it feels nice but yeah okay
[00:36:22] I'm going to run two hard of depth and
[00:36:25] uh probably two no bless on the other
[00:36:29] pieces wait do I need to run for bless
[00:36:31] no I don't think so yeah yeah yeah let's
[00:36:34] just do this boom and then ciret will
[00:36:37] run that and our ratio
[00:36:44] is and now our ratio is pretty
[00:36:49] good oh why tuna blast [ __ ] [ __ ] I autop
[00:36:52] piloted guys shut up shut up shut up
[00:36:54] shut up shut up shut up shut up I forgot
[00:36:58] honestly if I could use like Mona or
[00:37:00] kokomi oh my God if I could use kokomi
[00:37:03] dude kokomi would be
[00:37:04] cracked can't you use four blizzard I
[00:37:07] can but uh I only have one good four

[00:37:17] me I only have one blizzard Set uh we'll
[00:37:19] run to hard ad depth to glad I guess
[00:37:21] what else can I
[00:37:23] run probably
[00:37:26] glad boom
[00:37:30] Bo not
[00:37:34] bad okay let's go do I want to abandon
[00:37:38] or do I want to try again chat should I
[00:37:40] try again with this team or do I
[00:37:52] reset
[00:37:56] reset okay okay all
[00:38:00] right okay now the only thing I want to
[00:38:02] ask before we
[00:38:06] reset is is there a way try one more I

[00:38:23] very well it's good now how the [ __ ] do
[00:38:26] I make another team now if I'm allowed
[00:38:28] to use five stars which I might I'll
[00:38:31] just do something like this right not
[00:38:33] that hard uh it'll still be hard don't
[00:38:36] get me wrong but it's doable but if I
[00:38:38] can't use five stars I have to use
[00:38:40] probably a freeze team cuz I can't use
[00:38:42] bet because I have to normal attack I
[00:38:44] can't use like yon ra any of the normal
[00:38:47] attack characters I can't use so it
[00:38:49] literally only leaves
[00:38:51] me with cryo
[00:38:54] characters um to where
[00:39:03] yeah I think that's what I'm going to
[00:39:06] do yeah uh and then sucros sucros or
[00:39:11] Chong Yan chat we have to do sucros
[00:39:12] right to group them up oh no
[00:39:15] MC no we the suus
[00:39:20] uh MC is probably better no KY but we'll
[00:39:23] use
[00:39:25] sucros Rosario over Chong oh oops I
[00:39:27] meant to put Rosaria I think Rosaria is
[00:39:30] probably better than Chong in here I'm
[00:39:31] not sure though
[00:39:34] honestly all right let's try
[00:39:38] it if this okay if this attempt I'm
[00:39:41] saying this and I think I'm recording so
[00:39:43] I'm going to say it on the recording as
[00:39:44] well if this attempt doesn't work we
[00:39:46] might have to sub in five
[00:39:47] stars but I'll try to use yeah only I
[00:39:50] don't know we'll figure it out I'm going
[00:39:52] to put my mouse
[00:39:53] away and uh yeah let's go
[00:39:57] do you guys think I mean I could run the
[00:39:59] freeze team against the magu giving up
[00:40:01] so soon I mean Alexa do you think it's
[00:40:03] doable you know I have the artifacts I
[00:40:05] know you don't think I have the brain
[00:40:06] cells but if you tell me that it's
[00:40:08] doable with my second team I'll keep
[00:40:13] trying I don't know uh I don't know I
[00:40:16] think it's the second team is
[00:40:19] hard diona can Perma battery your second
[00:40:22] team diona would work but I don't really
[00:40:25] need energy so much as I need
[00:40:28] damage I don't know I've been
[00:40:30] multitasking I'll watch this time so my
[00:40:32] first team's really good my second team
[00:40:33] used to run Barbara Chong Yan Rosaria
[00:40:35] Kaya I just replaced Barbara Chong um
[00:40:38] but anyways we'll
[00:40:40] see okay so far so good now we Spin to
[00:40:43] Win
[00:40:45] sh okay good damage good
[00:40:50] damage this team is so
[00:40:53] cracked uh I'm just going to use fishal
[00:40:55] here probably was a waste but
[00:40:58] whatever do
[00:41:02] that all right now we wait for them to
[00:41:04] group I have no camera so this is
[00:41:15] fun all right so far so good Dodge those
[00:41:17] attacks oh my God they're not really
[00:41:19] groups that's fine actually yeah this
[00:41:23] good dude look at this damage these guys
[00:41:26] are P resistant too it's pretty good
[00:41:29] okay
[00:41:31] benit shling don't die do that that and
[00:41:37] then oh my e on cool
[00:41:39] down oh I didn't Shang Ling Al what am I
[00:41:42] doing I thought I used my pado okay I'm
[00:41:43] actually throwing that was kind of a
[00:41:45] waste it's fine we'll be okay we'll be
[00:41:48] fine okay now we have to see does singu
[00:41:53] work so e then e again then q but we
[00:41:58] can't really Auto
[00:41:59] attack do that that that
[00:42:06] Su
[00:42:09] um wow Mya has no energy recharge oh my
[00:42:13] God that's
[00:42:17] bad this guy has no particles
[00:42:23] dude dude look at that sinku damage holy
[00:42:26] [ __ ]
[00:42:29] this is actually pretty good this
[00:42:29] actually pretty good um there is a lot
[00:42:32] of downtime here though I got to stop
[00:42:35] swapping into those
[00:42:36] characters okay this is good do I have
[00:42:39] to use rosar I don't think I have
[00:42:41] to oh my God there's a huh where'd he
[00:42:44] come from wait where the [ __ ] was that
[00:42:46] boar okay uh bro how okay look that
[00:42:51] wasn't my fault dude what the [ __ ] where
[00:42:54] does he come from okay it's fine it's
[00:42:56] fine it's fine the particles Swap this
[00:42:58] thing Che that that rain swords
[00:43:02] swirl that's fine we still got this we
[00:43:04] still got this dude look at this
[00:43:08] damage uh
[00:43:11] wait please K get burst
[00:43:14] nice maybe I should run like er sounds
[00:43:16] or something I don't
[00:43:21] know so far so good so far so
[00:43:24] good so far so good okay
[00:43:27] easy 16 seconds left okay easy easy easy
[00:43:32] easy easy easy might need sa frag on the
[00:43:34] sucrose maybe but I think thrilling
[00:43:36] Tales is better all right now we pick
[00:43:38] this free burst damage now this is the
[00:43:40] hard part because we're running a full
[00:43:42] cryo team in against Crow resistant
[00:43:44] enemies so if we can beat this we beat
[00:43:49] everything this is why you should use
[00:43:51] freeze against magu but you can't freeze
[00:43:53] the
[00:43:54] magu unless you mean like okay even if
[00:43:57] the magu team is worse Shang Ling will
[00:43:59] carry the second half if that's what you
[00:44:01] mean maybe like maybe running the freeze
[00:44:03] team even without freezing might be
[00:44:05] worth it just
[00:44:07] because I don't know we'll see all right
[00:44:10] let's
[00:44:13] go oh my God my Shang Ling has no
[00:44:15] particles what the f please please
[00:44:17] please operation give Shang Ling her
[00:44:23] burst before Bol expires please
[00:44:28] I still got it I still got the B yeah
[00:44:30] yeah I still got it okay this is good so
[00:44:33] far so good so far so
[00:44:36] good DOD that yep give her her bur
[00:44:40] back like overloading in general is
[00:44:43] pretty bad cuz it knocks enemies away
[00:44:44] but against heavy enemies like magu like
[00:44:46] this is
[00:44:47] good this is a good team okay do
[00:44:51] that we we roll oh don't die oh my
[00:44:55] God me
[00:45:01] okay
[00:45:03] guys okay let me let me
[00:45:06] hydrate okay look it was just unlucky it
[00:45:08] was just unlucky putting my mouse away
[00:45:10] we go
[00:45:12] again so I literally need to give my my
[00:45:15] Shang Ling her burst back a fap as fast
[00:45:18] as
[00:45:21] possible do that I probably should use
[00:45:23] venol but we'll be fine
[00:45:31] all right we got it this pretty good
[00:45:32] this pretty good so far so
[00:45:35] good oh my God I'm taking so much
[00:45:38] damage get him saou yeah you show them W
[00:45:44] he did a spin what the [ __ ] was that
[00:45:46] dude I panicked he literally did a
[00:45:51] 360 perfect todge wait I'm misclicking
[00:45:55] oh my God this is so hard I clicked the
[00:45:56] wrong buttons
[00:45:57] it's fine we got this he's probably
[00:45:59] going to dash away here
[00:46:02] yep okay I dodged it do
[00:46:06] this okay so far so good so far so
[00:46:09] good so far so good uh so to
[00:46:15] bit okay this is really good so far this
[00:46:17] is actually really good should I use
[00:46:18] power or do I save it we're using it
[00:46:21] might have been dumb but okay that
[00:46:22] official Al is a waste it's fine we got
[00:46:24] it that was good that was good
[00:46:32] okay now for the hard part I'm going to
[00:46:35] need to group up all these enemies
[00:46:37] together and then freeze them together
[00:46:39] I'm not really sure how to do that cuz I
[00:46:41] usually use venti over sucros but we'll
[00:46:44] be

[00:59:34] to just so that everyone's aware the
[00:59:36] current 4123 is the hardest DPS check so

[01:01:39] [ __ ] nuts that was actually insane
[01:01:42] yeah it was unlucky on the Bennett tick
[01:01:44] like I I should have waited a bit longer
[01:01:46] or something but I tried to get healed
[01:01:47] and didn't work also my S is not an
[01:01:50] elemental Mastery that would help a lot

[01:02:00] uh all right let's
[01:02:05] go we need to get the first half as fast
[01:02:08] as possible AAP because the second half
[01:02:10] is like the hard one
[01:02:14] so that maybe a bad rotation
[01:02:21] but oh my god dude this damage is
[01:02:24] insane that guy breaks my um he breaks
[01:02:27] my sa's e though when he hits me which

[01:03:15] let's go wait oh my God that was amazing
[01:03:18] okay okay that was vable why are you
[01:03:20] pretending to hold a mouse my hand is
[01:03:22] naturally in a mouse posture it feels
[01:03:24] weird like unless you want me to put my
[01:03:25] mouse I'm
[01:03:27] like never mind I I I mean my hand I
[01:03:30] don't know where else to put my hand
[01:03:31] like I can put it on my chair but I'm
[01:03:32] just going to leave it
[01:03:34] here chat let's say you might be
[01:03:36] wondering oh how is this useful right
[01:03:39] well let's say you're doing other things
[01:03:41] right maybe homework maybe whatever and
[01:03:43] your right hand is impaired then you can
[01:03:45] clear the abyss as I'm doing with only
[01:03:47] your left
[01:03:49] yep all right anyways
[01:03:57] okay before we begin I am notoriously I
[01:04:00] am pretty bad at 123 second half because
[01:04:03] you know what let me show you guys why
[01:04:04] before I before I do this challenge let
[01:04:06] me show you guys why I'm pretty bad at
[01:04:07] this
[01:04:09] half has image let me just search
[01:04:12] through me and Z Jeff's DMS
[01:04:14] okay let me show you when I ask Z Jeff
[01:04:16] hey do you have any advice for like
[01:04:18] grouping these enemies let me show you
[01:04:21] what mr's the Jeff sent me he sent me
[01:04:24] four series of images guide five images
[01:04:27] guiding me how to do how to group the
[01:04:30] enemies this is what he sent
[01:04:32] me bro
[01:04:37] what what the [ __ ] does this
[01:04:41] mean dude like the enemy spawns in the
[01:04:44] like when you're here he spawns in front
[01:04:46] of you not behind you like everything is
[01:04:48] it's
[01:04:50] so Z Jeff the master artist dude I know
[01:04:54] he was like it's simple I'm like bro
[01:04:56] okay so I think I go behind this dude
[01:04:59] yeah I know that part I go behind the
[01:05:00] this
[01:05:03] dude then I push him over
[01:05:07] there then I go behind that dude I push
[01:05:09] him in the
[01:05:12] middle
[01:05:14] okay okay we're going to try it we're
[01:05:16] going to try it we're going to try it we
[01:05:18] going to try it I'm going to trust this
[01:05:19] the Jeff
[01:05:21] advice
[01:05:23] uh yeah so you think I should go up to
[01:05:25] one of them but I can't Auto attack
[01:05:27] right so how am I going to do that cuz
[01:05:29] I'm running a freeze team like I can't
[01:05:30] use my mouse so I can't like I can't do
[01:05:33] I can't Auto
[01:05:39] attack refuses to elaborate Giga
[01:05:43] chat
[01:05:45] yeah can you do Abyss guides I have
[01:05:47] Abyss guides for the old rotations I
[01:05:49] just didn't make one for this rotation
[01:05:50] but I suspect that the next Abyss might
[01:05:52] be very hard if it is I will make a
[01:05:54] guide so there should be there will be
[01:05:56] an abyss guide for the next Abyss I
[01:06:04] think anyways uh I'm going to be honest
[01:06:07] I don't know if I'm supposed to group
[01:06:08] these enemies with a freeze team but I
[01:06:10] can try this might be the test attempt I
[01:06:12] don't think I'll get it first try but as
[01:06:14] I said test attempt so I bait him over
[01:06:16] here how do I push this guy does
[01:06:18] abilities make him do abilities make a
[01:06:21] move I think we just killed two at a
[01:06:23] time honestly I think we just kill two
[01:06:26] at a
[01:06:28] time oh wait what if I what if I do this
[01:06:32] and then I I can't Auto attack
[01:06:34] so no that that did nothing okay this
[01:06:37] was
[01:06:39] terrible
[01:06:43] cuz
[01:06:50] uh yeah I'm going to have to learn to
[01:06:52] group these better
[01:06:58] that's fine though the damage is good
[01:06:59] the damage is actually good we do this
[01:07:07] that my Kai is literally about to die
[01:07:11] dude uh
[01:07:15] [ __ ] oh my God he's full HP
[01:07:19] what okay we do that this that swap to
[01:07:24] Kaa who's on life support catch
[01:07:26] particles boom okay I think we can do
[01:07:28] this if we just group up a bit
[01:07:30] better oh no he's not
[01:07:32] dead he is he not dead okay it's fine
[01:07:36] this is a test run no no don't
[01:07:42] Dash okay good
[01:07:44] damage
[01:07:47] swirl this is good try to hit them all
[01:07:49] with the E yep oh my God this is so good
[01:07:52] okay I'm going to die but it's fine we
[01:07:54] get the next run guys that damage was
[01:07:57] actually was actually good okay that was
[01:08:00] good damage we just need to do it we
[01:08:03] need to be better at the first
[01:08:09] half okay uh let's do this again mouse
[01:08:12] is
[01:08:18] away the think you sto the dash
[01:08:22] yeah K Rosario teams are cracked yeah
[01:08:24] and somehow
[01:08:26] they're considered some of the like a
[01:08:28] lot of people when they think of meta
[01:08:29] teams meta whatever like when people
[01:08:31] tell me like oh this character is not
[01:08:32] that good they go to based on the usage
[01:08:34] rates in the 412 and look at how how low
[01:08:36] Kaa is [ __ ] 5% he's so good where's
[01:08:40] Rosaria rosaria's higher but still
[01:08:41] pretty low like free teams are
[01:08:44] broken like ka's just a bit worse AA but
[01:08:47] aa's like yeah they're both so good used
[01:08:50] to dra Omega yeah exactly all right
[01:08:53] let's put bua here again and uh let's
[01:08:58] go all right take
[01:09:06] two
[01:09:08] okay uh now something I want to say is
[01:09:10] that it's a 5050 whether this guy hits
[01:09:12] us or teleports so if he doesn't
[01:09:14] teleport I am going to have to
[01:09:16] reset uh
[01:09:19] ideally we just get lucky but there
[01:09:21] might be a little bit of resetting if we
[01:09:23] get unlucky dude my my earphon are like
[01:09:25] okay wait let me fix them okay it's
[01:09:27] better how do I put booba in the camera
[01:09:29] I'll put him like there he is he's
[01:09:32] peeking all right going to put my mouse
[01:09:39] away all right let's go take two
[01:09:43] v no how did he it's fine it's fine fine
[01:09:47] H unlucky he's not grouping yeah I'm
[01:09:50] lucky it's just not worth doing if he
[01:09:52] doesn't teleport it's a 50/50 like this
[01:09:55] this challenge is already so hard that
[01:09:56] I'm not going to make it harder BB how
[01:09:58] do you redeem run and AD when I can't
[01:10:00] use my
[01:10:01] mouse okay I'll run a 30 second I don't
[01:10:04] normally run ads if you're new here I
[01:10:06] like never run ads but if you want to
[01:10:08] dodge it either just get an ad blocker
[01:10:09] or subscribe and you miss ads and you
[01:10:10] can sub for free with TCH Prime okay I'm
[01:10:12] going to do this just cuz of the CH
[01:10:13] Point redeem uh but the first half is
[01:10:15] nothing anyway so you're not missing
[01:10:16] much okay let's go take
[01:10:22] two all right B it here
[01:10:26] boom give Shang Ling her burst
[01:10:29] back dude he's not teleporting oh he did
[01:10:31] he did he did this is good this good

[01:10:37] damage I'm telling you this team is
[01:10:39] actually
[01:10:42] insane wait I'm going to die I'm going
[01:10:44] to
[01:10:47] die no don't
[01:10:49] die uh okay maybe this is a bad clear

[01:11:55] really what the [ __ ] is
[01:11:57] that wider turn yeah maybe going fast
[01:12:01] does more Pyon hits though I think but
[01:12:04] yeah let's just go
[01:12:05] again all right let's
[01:12:14] go oh he's not teleporting

[01:12:52] 50/50 what do you mean left all these
[01:12:54] groups
[01:12:55] let always group no it's a 50/50 it
[01:12:58] either teleports or it doesn't if it
[01:13:01] always groups for you it's cuz you
[01:13:02] haven't done the abyss as many times as
[01:13:03] I have to where your sample size is
[01:13:05] smaller it's literally either he groups
[01:13:07] or he
[01:13:08] doesn't go
[01:13:10] backwards like
[01:13:19] there if one of them Burrows go to yeah

[01:17:51] hitting that last one is kind of hard
[01:17:57] okay then me do
[01:17:59] this bro there actually how the [ __ ] do
[01:18:02] I grip these
[01:18:04] guys he ran away
[01:18:07] what okay listen listen listen
[01:18:13] uh okay we do that that that wrong
[01:18:18] character wrong character I meant to
[01:18:19] do okay this actually isn't bad this
[01:18:22] isn't bad this looked a lot worse than
[01:18:24] it
[01:18:25] is because it's pretty
[01:18:27] good okay not bad winable I could have
[01:18:31] grouped them a bit better but yeah
[01:18:33] center of the Run guard yeah I think I
[01:18:35] should I tried to push them together but
[01:18:37] it didn't work maybe I should go to the
[01:18:38] middle of the Run guard that might not
[01:18:40] be a bad idea okay we have a lot of
[01:18:46] time okay Z if you're still here I kind
[01:18:50] of need you to explain your ven
[01:18:53] diagram if I stand here will they run to
[01:18:56] me or do I literally have to go to them
[01:18:58] and then push them to the
[01:19:05] center no yeah I didn't think
[01:19:10] so I can call if you want all right [ __ ]
[01:19:14] it I'm calling
[01:19:23] you he's going to Flame
[01:19:25] me I know he's going to Flame
[01:19:29] me yo what up
[01:19:32] zff yo what's up how you doing my friend
[01:19:35] and math guy but mainly friend M sure
[01:19:39] let me turn your volume up here I put
[01:19:40] you 200 okay what's up all right what's
[01:19:43] up um okay so let me just mute my game
[01:19:46] real quick yeah so I know you can push
[01:19:50] them to each other but I don't really
[01:19:53] fully understand how I should do it
[01:19:54] especially if I can't Auto attack yeah
[01:19:56] so there's there's
[01:19:59] like the the the the the the tldr of it
[01:20:03] is when you deal damage to them in melee
[01:20:06] range yeah they have a 50% chance is to
[01:20:12] dash away from you okay I yeah knowing
[01:20:15] it's a chance yeah okay cuz sometimes
[01:20:16] I'm not sure if I'm doing it right but
[01:20:18] yeah but you do have to damage them
[01:20:19] though okay so I can just use like
[01:20:21] sucros e or Kay e or some [ __ ] yeah I I
[01:20:24] would use K okay um but Rosaria [ __ ]
[01:20:28] hits them from behind that's so C don't
[01:20:30] don't try it with Rosaria she's going to
[01:20:31] [ __ ] it up okay but if ka's e doesn't
[01:20:34] procet I should just I guess I could use
[01:20:36] Kaia burst right yeah so there's
[01:20:42] like there's two attacks they can start
[01:20:44] with they can either start with an
[01:20:46] specific attack or they'll do the back
[01:20:48] dash yeah if they start with a specific
[01:20:50] attack and you attack them with your k e
[01:20:52] it's going to stun them
[01:20:55] okay so do is is stop attacking them
[01:20:58] wait for them to get un stunned and then
[01:21:00] reack
[01:21:02] them okay and if they don't stun then
[01:21:05] they
[01:21:06] move uh yeah yeah if they don't stun
[01:21:08] they're General so they either stun or
[01:21:09] they move if they stun I wait a bit then
[01:21:11] I do it yeah okay cool thank you um and
[01:21:15] in in terms of like where you want to
[01:21:18] stand yeah
[01:21:20] you like the the range of their Dash is
[01:21:23] like compared to where they are versus
[01:21:25] where where like the middle is it's more
[01:21:28] than that so you need to like do it say
[01:21:30] that again my chat was spamming zff gig
[01:21:32] chat I got
[01:21:33] distracted so the the the range of the B
[01:21:36] Dash is bigger than the the distance
[01:21:39] between where they are in the middle so
[01:21:42] you can't just exactly so the the the
[01:21:45] the diagram I sent you isn't
[01:21:46] perfect
[01:21:48] yeah I've refined it since so I like
[01:21:51] push the right to the middle left to the
[01:21:53] middle yeah not exactly the middle you
[01:21:55] have to do it at an angle right so more
[01:21:58] or less the right angle
[01:22:01] is you basically make a straight line
[01:22:04] between you the ruin Scout no not Scout
[01:22:09] ruin Cruiser and the Run
[01:22:13] guard right the Yeah but isn't that oh
[01:22:16] like where he's here where he's like
[01:22:18] North the yeah so the the Run guard is
[01:22:21] North oh so I push them like towards the
[01:22:23] the top kind of
[01:22:25] like no you push it towards the Run
[01:22:27] guard but yeah sure but do I bait the
[01:22:30] Run guard here first so he doesn't shoot
[01:22:31] missiles or no oh he can shoot it it
[01:22:34] doesn't matter but I'm going to die just
[01:22:37] dodge it bro I can't Dodge missiles I
[01:22:40] don't have a mous they're they don't
[01:22:42] home in as strongly if you're far away
[01:22:45] from them so they're easy to dodge if
[01:22:47] you going to be far from them okay also
[01:22:49] okay code wide Hardo in my chat so yeah
[01:22:52] I know you can can actually you know
[01:22:53] what I'm I'm mod in your chat yo yo y
[01:22:57] mod of views C there you
[01:23:00] go
[01:23:04] um okay okay I'm I'm sorry it's not my
[01:23:07] actually I'm a mod
[01:23:10] mon okay cool I'll make sure to not
[01:23:12] freeze them then I'll push both of them
[01:23:13] to the center then kill them and then
[01:23:15] you don't want to you don't want to cast
[01:23:17] anything until they're group together
[01:23:19] and you can group them I might just
[01:23:20] start with Rosaria hit him like oh no
[01:23:23] cuz he's not going to turn around never
[01:23:24] mind never mind just yeah and just Kai's
[01:23:27] e cool down is long like it's if I if it
[01:23:29] doesn't proc it's going to be
[01:23:30] annoying yeah it is yeah I hate why do
[01:23:35] they put RNG in the abyss Matt fine I
[01:23:37] know it's it's great but yeah so you you
[01:23:41] you want to either do a straight line
[01:23:43] between uh the you the cruiser and the
[01:23:46] ru guard or you can do it like rotate
[01:23:50] that [ __ ] 90 degrees or not 90 degrees
[01:23:53] but mirror that on the side
[01:23:57] yeah I'll
[01:23:59] [Music]
[01:24:01] do
[01:24:03] sorry the the reason why it's not
[01:24:05] perfect to put them towards a run guard
[01:24:07] is because the run grer in the rest of
[01:24:09] the second wave spawns on the other side
[01:24:10] of the room okay and so ideally you want
[01:24:14] to bring them together to where the
[01:24:16] second wave spawns oh yeah but is is
[01:24:19] that harder to do or do I
[01:24:22] just the it it's kind of harder in a way
[01:24:26] cuz like instead of being able I mean I
[01:24:28] don't mind dashing twice towards the Run
[01:24:30] dude but if I kill them over here like
[01:24:31] in the north then the Run guard is going
[01:24:33] to start dashing towards me and I'm
[01:24:34] going to
[01:24:35] mold what oh yeah yeah exactly yeah so
[01:24:40] [ __ ] yeah and that's why I like like
[01:24:44] doing it in the South right but so I
[01:24:47] angle it there then I go to the other
[01:24:48] dude angle him there I'm sharing the
[01:24:50] screen by the way all do that dude wait
[01:24:52] wait okay let me let me let me let me
[01:24:53] take a look so like this dude spawns I
[01:24:55] do like and then he goes over there do I
[01:24:58] just have to make him TP once where are
[01:25:00] you now oh okay so this is where
[01:25:04] you this is how it starts okay yeah yeah
[01:25:08] so I go to one of these two dudes then I
[01:25:10] angle him let's say here a little bit
[01:25:13] more towards the yeah okay so little bit
[01:25:16] right little bit right yeah more L to
[01:25:20] the torch
[01:25:21] right wait oh that's a better okay
[01:25:24] that's a lot better okay torch actually
[01:25:27] well you're he doesn't spawn exactly as
[01:25:31] far but whatever torch is should be good
[01:25:33] enough okay and then this one around
[01:25:36] like or you you can you can use the like
[01:25:38] pillar with the Rune yeah right cuz
[01:25:41] there's a pillar with a rune on both
[01:25:42] sides and it should be more or less good
[01:25:44] enough pillar with the oh this one
[01:25:48] yeah but will one teleport be enough I
[01:25:51] feel like they don't teleport that far
[01:25:52] do they oh that you you you you go
[01:25:55] towards one of them you make it teleport
[01:25:56] and then you go to the other one and you
[01:25:58] make it teleport as well and then is
[01:26:00] that enough have to repeat no one one
[01:26:02] for each is enough and if you do it
[01:26:04] right you can group them like close
[01:26:08] enough that they like they head boxes on
[01:26:10] top of each other and they yeah okay the
[01:26:12] ru with the torch here is this one right
[01:26:15] no no but no no this one this one this
[01:26:16] one yeah yeah like technically you're
[01:26:19] also not going to be standing there
[01:26:20] right like you
[01:26:21] have it's not just looking at that you
[01:26:24] have to be in a straight line between
[01:26:26] like the the Cruiser has to be in
[01:26:29] between that point and
[01:26:33] you wait yeah okay wait but I have to be
[01:26:37] in melee range so what do you mean like
[01:26:39] yeah well oh you're saying like yeah the
[01:26:42] dude's just right here right once it
[01:26:43] starts a time no not exactly like it's
[01:26:46] like on the on the
[01:26:48] cross right on the ground yeah sure more
[01:26:52] or less on the cross this thing
[01:26:55] sure is but like you would want to stand
[01:26:58] like there yeah but it it's it's closer
[01:27:00] to the middle
[01:27:02] right that'll be fine closer to the
[01:27:04] middle okay I got this all right thank
[01:27:08] you I appreciate you chat yeah big up Z
[01:27:11] Jeff stream I link them in chat if you

[01:39:55] wait I didn't kill
[01:39:57] the
[01:39:59] what how it's fine bro no no shot no
[01:40:03] shot no shot can do
[01:40:10] [Music]
[01:40:12] that don't die K swap out of K swap out

[01:40:23] do that do that Dodge that then go Kaaya
[01:40:27] boom uh
[01:40:30] [ __ ]
[01:40:38] guys
[01:40:40] um um I mean it's
[01:40:44] doable how many how much more second how
[01:40:46] many more seconds I need let's just see
[01:40:48] how many more seconds I need if I play
[01:40:50] well and then we'll decide if it's
[01:40:52] doable
[01:40:54] honestly only about 15 I think 15 more
[01:40:57] seconds I could have done
[01:40:59] that I think 15 more seconds that was
[01:41:05] doable may I unmute
[01:41:11] sure hello y think just yeah um one
[01:41:18] other thing you should know is on the uh
[01:41:21] on the greater the the spot that found
[01:41:24] to be the most sucessful to stand in is
[01:41:26] right behind him okay and obviously
[01:41:32] there's RNG on that one as well
[01:41:35] um yay there's a 50% chance that each of
[01:41:39] the Defenders jump to you instead of
[01:41:41] shielding up yeah I noticed that I don't
[01:41:44] know 50 if both of them jump so
[01:41:47] 25% then they're like all grouped around
[01:41:51] you and they're frozen hits everything
[01:41:53] thing
[01:41:54] you 25 if
[01:41:56] it h yeah okay and yeah it's a 25%
[01:42:01] chance because you think I should just
[01:42:03] like try to get I think I should try to
[01:42:05] get as fast as a 12 three clear as
[01:42:07] possible cuz it's easier I think like if
[01:42:10] I [ __ ] up I
[01:42:12] just bro it's hard to get this in
[01:42:15] time also my rosar is not even on for
[01:42:17] blizzard cuz I don't
[01:42:18] have also you really really should stand
[01:42:21] in the back for for for first half
[01:42:24] really yeah okay I'll try it right now
[01:42:27] on call with you if it works I will
[01:42:29] admit you were you were five head oh
[01:42:33] [ __ ] it worked okay okay all right okay
[01:42:38] I cut that out of the video that
[01:42:39] specific one that specific one is a 25%
[01:42:41] chance to happen what you want to do is
[01:42:44] you just you just walk backwards but
[01:42:46] keep looking forward and 50% of the time
[01:42:50] um only one of them is going to teleport
[01:42:52] well Bur dig whatever and you just run
[01:42:55] to the other one as soon as the health
[01:42:57] bar
[01:42:59] disappears disappears it means they're
[01:43:01] digging so the one whose health bar
[01:43:03] didn't disappear you run since the abyss
[01:43:05] is RNG anyways let us test our
[01:43:08] RNG sorry I have content in My DNA I'm
[01:43:11] sorry you're you're you're addicted Nick
[01:43:14] four single pulls you're
[01:43:17] addicted okay all right let's let's stop
[01:43:19] let's stop let's stop okay cool uh I'm

[01:43:55] okay I'm just going Max DPS I don't care
[01:43:56] about dodging I don't care about
[01:43:57] anything we have to deal as much damage
[01:43:59] as
[01:44:00] possible uh because the second half is
[01:44:02] the hard
[01:44:05] part uh this could be better but it
[01:44:08] could also be a lot worse so we're fine
[01:44:10] with this cuz I got another pado in this

[02:02:41] guard is this guy just taking a [ __ ]
[02:02:43] nap bro what is he doing
[02:02:56] oh oops wrong character swop what am I
[02:02:57] doing oh my God I keep killing the wrong
[02:03:01] character uh I think I need maybe more
[02:03:04] time than
[02:03:05] this but uh it's fine maling I'm not
[02:03:10] mding you're Ming okay my rotation is
[02:03:17] terrible fine it's winable
[02:03:22] please die please die please
[02:03:25] die I hate this game I hate this game
[02:03:28] let it be known that I despise this
[02:03:48] game um honestly
[02:03:56] go here I think yo this is a lot closer
[02:04:00] than I
[02:04:00] expected I think this is doable look
[02:04:03] look we do that then we do this then we
[02:04:05] do that then we do that
[02:04:09] right and then that that and then s rain
[02:04:13] swords probably would have killed them
[02:04:14] so around we needed around 15 seconds
[02:04:16] more and we cleared the first half at
[02:04:18] 8:45 when I know I can clear at 9
[02:04:20] minutes so it's actually
[02:04:23] doable I can explain how you can prevent
[02:04:25] the ruin hunter from going to naria zff
[02:04:27] why do you know everything about the
[02:04:29] abyss how many how many hours do you
[02:04:31] spend
[02:04:34] here okay
[02:04:39] hello hi okay so it's actually a Prett
[02:04:42] pretty complicated trick so what you
[02:04:44] want to do for this one is you uh so you
[02:04:48] you you do the same start as usual and
[02:04:51] then
[02:04:52] if he does the attack where he goes to
[02:04:54] Naro you
[02:04:56] reset there's nothing you can do about
[02:04:59] it okay dude all right thanks for the
[02:05:03] thanks for the advanced tip I got
[02:05:07] you I'm
[02:05:09] done all right well with that knowledge

[02:05:36] okay oh I didn't mean to what am I
[02:05:39] doing it's fine this is good cuz I got
[02:05:41] the dodgy attack that way oh he went
[02:05:43] into Narnia we have to do the tech where
[02:05:44] we reset yeah yeah that's good that was
[02:05:46] optimal zff told me uh that if he does
[02:05:48] that attack we have a tech now that was
[02:05:50] good that was good that was good
[02:05:55] all right run it
[02:05:58] back stop spamming my
[02:06:02] chat yeah let's

[02:08:26] uh so he did the attack where he went to
[02:08:29] Narnia and uh zff told me to reset if
[02:08:33] that happens but I'm more of a Believer

[02:20:16] 50/50 teleport
[02:20:23] teleport I hate this game I hate this
[02:20:25] game it's fine it kind of worked out my
[02:20:27] sackur didn't proc because I lost
[02:20:29] another uh pretty high chance my stord
[02:20:31] R4 so the odd procing were pretty high
[02:20:34] in case you're wondering and then he
[02:20:36] just teleported away okay all right
[02:20:39] okay all right that was just
[02:20:42] unlucky that was just
[02:20:46] unlucky all right we got
[02:20:48] this 6 hours stream yeah that's
[02:20:53] whatever it's whatever it's content I
[02:21:00] guess trying a new improvised
[02:21:05] rotation this might work a Dodge attack
[02:21:08] okay oh is's he going to
[02:21:13] Narnia like there's a lot of skill
[02:21:15] involved but there's also a lot of luck
[02:21:16] so it's kind of annoying
[02:21:21] all right we got
[02:21:25] this
[02:21:28] please wait what the [ __ ] which one's
[02:21:29] digging oh I [ __ ] up my bad my bad my
[02:21:32] okay run it back run it back run it back
[02:21:34] that one was my bad that one was my bad
[02:21:36] okay so uh first ever attempt not using
[02:21:39] the mouse wow can we do it fourar
[02:21:41] characters I wonder four star weapons as
[02:21:43] well insane they're both going to dig to
[02:21:45] us cuz we're lucky okay or not but this
[02:21:48] works all right do that do
[02:21:53] that all right this is good so far so
[02:21:57] good so far so good sh look at the
[02:22:04] damage okay honestly I'm liking what I'm
[02:22:07] seeing I tried to use my S burst there
[02:22:10] again like it's so hard to do at the end
[02:22:12] you like
[02:22:15] can't okay this is good though this is
[02:22:17] actually really
[02:22:18] good please teleport please oh he got
[02:22:20] stop I missed the 5050 okay hopefully
[02:22:23] here we hit
[02:22:25] it okay we lost the 50/50 again it looks
[02:22:28] like cool and now they're not
[02:22:34] grouped
[02:22:36] [Music]
[02:22:41] uh yeah okay we don't talk about it just
[02:22:44] pretend that didn't happen I don't even
[02:22:45] want to talk about
[02:22:48] that I just don't want to talk about
[02:22:50] that all right no mouse take two or take
[02:22:54] yeah
[02:23:08] two DOD that attack I didn't dodge it
[02:23:10] but it's
[02:23:12] fine I don't even know what's happening
[02:23:14] but oh he's doing the
[02:23:17] [ __ ] the thing with this attack is
[02:23:19] like I me is not that bad right now cuz
[02:23:21] I'm like in between my burst but it just
[02:23:23] delays us so much and like he's still
[02:23:25] [ __ ] he's like full HP cuz whenever
[02:23:28] he does that attack he dashes and
[02:23:29] doesn't take damage from you so like
[02:23:31] even if I can still kill him even if
[02:23:32] he'll come back it just takes so long
[02:23:34] that it's not worth
[02:23:36] it all right attempt 6 million can he do
[02:23:40] it
[02:23:42] finally neither of them died okay

[02:26:56] reach for like fishal on my keyboard for
[02:26:58] is so far away my hand is in like the
[02:27:01] weirdest
[02:27:03] position where's the last one oh
[02:27:07] my not bad same time as usual but I feel
[02:27:11] like every time I mess up I get that
[02:27:13] time okay oh my god dude my wrist okay
[02:27:18] let's go
[02:27:20] please get
[02:27:23] lucky
[02:27:25] nice how did I get hit it's
[02:27:28] fine
[02:27:31] whatever oh I [ __ ] froze him I'm so
[02:27:33] brain dead I'm actually just stupid I
[02:27:36] don't he teleported oh it doesn't matter
[02:27:37] hey it's fine okay it actually does not
[02:27:39] matter do that do
[02:27:41] that that uh my saxer didn't proc which
[02:27:45] was kind of wait he shot missiles at me
[02:27:48] oh it's over
[02:27:51] how did I yeah my sax literally are four
[02:27:53] or five I can't remember but it should
[02:27:55] be
[02:27:58] proing yeah this is a terrible
[02:28:01] run
[02:28:04] SM four yeah that's what I
[02:28:10] figured what are the odds like 80 all
[02:28:13] that's fine does it matter it does
[02:28:15] matter SES RS are very
[02:28:17] important for healing right
[02:28:20] could be wrong also constellations bu
[02:28:22] your damage it's not that important but
[02:28:24] it
[02:28:25] helps 70 oh fair enough
[02:28:32] okay oh
[02:28:34] [ __ ] thought it was going to dig restart
[02:28:37] a abys for Full Burst no I don't think
[02:28:40] it's worth it like we got this we know
[02:28:42] we can last time we would have had it if
[02:28:44] if the ruin dude uh teleported if both
[02:28:47] of them teleported we would have got it
[02:28:48] so that was just RNG
[02:28:50] um now we just need to replicate the
[02:28:52] same thing but with better
[02:28:54] luck which sounds easier than it is but
[02:28:57] he we'll see oh my God what is this
[02:28:59] damage wait this is our best run yo
[02:29:03] that's fine that's
[02:29:07] fine this is
[02:29:10] good um yeah this is really
[02:29:17] good except this guy's not teleporting
[02:29:20] which is just oh wait spoke too

[02:29:44] doesn't matter run it back Staying Alive
[02:29:48] usually helps yeah
[02:29:52] SM oh we got crit today oh well there
[02:29:54] you go that's a
[02:29:57] buff all right no
[02:30:06] mouse this is actually the

[02:30:44] bad please teleport please teleport he
[02:30:47] didn't teleport that was just unlucky
[02:30:53] um I actually don't know what to do when
[02:30:55] that
[02:30:59] happens yeah I don't know what to do
[02:31:01] when that
[02:31:03] happens I mean if we get an 850 then
[02:31:05] it's fine but I don't know if we're
[02:31:07] going to get
[02:31:11] 850 yeah we didn't
[02:31:15] sadness tangling is cracked yeah she's
[02:31:18] on a bad her sand is bad too every other
[02:31:20] piece is really good
[02:31:22] though every other piece is pretty
[02:31:25] cracked oh [ __ ] whatever let's just hope
[02:31:27] he teleports I don't I messed up
[02:31:30] but oh we got it okay
[02:31:36] [Music]
[02:31:41] cool they're not as grouped as I would
[02:31:44] like them to
[02:31:45] be but
[02:31:47] uh it's fine
[02:31:55] [Applause]
[02:31:56] [Music]
[02:32:01] honestly [ __ ] it I don't even need to
[02:32:03] make him teleport I'm just going to root
[02:32:04] force it I think I have enough damage to
[02:32:06] just oh my God he teleported over there
[02:32:08] okay that's just
[02:32:11] cringe
[02:32:13] um okay I probably played that bad but I
[02:32:16] didn't think you'd [ __ ] teleport over
[02:32:17] there
[02:32:21] actually wait this could still be
[02:32:23] good this could still be good
[02:32:26] wait 858 wait yo okay that was our
[02:32:30] fastest time I messed up but that was
[02:32:32] our fastest time okay I feel like this
[02:32:36] is making me a better player this is so
[02:32:37] [ __ ] hard okay
[02:32:40] please nice Dodge the missiles Dodge oh
[02:32:44] I dashed into them but it's fine like I
[02:32:46] dodged at the right time but I dashed
[02:32:47] into them was very stupid
[02:32:51] okay sax sword
[02:32:54] proed that
[02:32:59] yeping tails to
[02:33:02] Kaa why am I stuck I can't
[02:33:05] move
[02:33:10] okay so far so good wait did one of them
[02:33:13] teleport away what the
[02:33:16] [ __ ] what the how did he
[02:33:24] huh okay this guy's not grouping I don't
[02:33:27] know what to tell
[02:33:29] you it's still good though this still
[02:33:31] our fastest time like we messed up well
[02:33:33] it messed up
[02:33:35] but
[02:33:39] fine
[02:33:43] uh I don't know might be doable good RNG
[02:33:48] oh they did wait
[02:33:51] I wish I had my [ __ ] sinku rain
[02:33:52] swords okay this is wable I'm going to
[02:33:54] try to save a burst to dodge stuff if I
[02:33:56] can't Dodge if I can't
[02:33:58] Dash oh my God I actually yeah it's so
[02:34:02] hard cuz you get stuck in between them
[02:34:04] so like dashing to dodge something is
[02:34:06] really hard cuz I run into them and then
[02:34:09] I like
[02:34:11] yeah
[02:34:16] sadness
[02:34:18] um I don't think this is doable I mean
[02:34:21] it would have been
[02:34:25] doable H trying to think yeah
[02:34:32] yeah only there was a hydro healer
[02:34:34] Barbara wouldn't even be close I don't
[02:34:37] think I don't think Barbara would do
[02:34:39] anything like sure she'd heal but singu
[02:34:41] gives us 23,000 AOE damage on every e
[02:34:45] and it hits twice because of the sack
[02:34:49] sword
[02:34:59] so I don't think we'd be able with
[02:35:00] Barbara like Yeah The Healing is nice
[02:35:01] but like okay I canceled my
[02:35:05] [ __ ]
[02:35:08] uh yeah this just
[02:35:13] cringe how about kokomi she's a five
[02:35:16] star

[02:35:33] five I lent one to uh I land went to
[02:35:35] code last night
[02:36:05] okay this is good I think oh he's

[02:36:09] far uh I mean it's still
[02:36:12] good that's unlucky but it's still
[02:36:16] good yeah this is still
[02:36:18] good
[02:36:27] for uh we just need this guy to
[02:36:30] teleport he's not I don't know if
[02:36:33] there's a better way for me to trigger
[02:36:37] that yeah I [ __ ] up yeah this was my
