[00:16:27] just want to look at my camera it looks
[00:16:28] weird you always have to have the
[00:16:29] opportunity while it's there

[00:33:28] one more endless because these are too
[00:33:29] easy I want that's like a challenge
[00:33:30] where I actually have to think you know
[00:33:32] like these have been so easy I haven't
[00:33:33] been having to think at all so I want
[00:33:35] one that like challenges me tickles me a
[00:33:37] little prosperity it's kicking
[00:33:45] who else's Prosperity isn't England
[00:33:47] Prosperity or she diligence
[00:33:49] scratch
[00:33:51] [ __ ] smells very well I guess every
[00:33:52] [ __ ] Prosperity character in the
[00:33:53] world who else is prosperity
[00:33:55] Shen hot no she's not falling uh
[00:33:58] countless sword pole arm oh wait it
[00:34:01] couldn't have been
[00:34:03] okay Claymore from leeway
[00:34:07] no there's none and if there's one
[00:34:09] they're irrelevant so obedo
[00:34:11] what about Electro
[00:34:14] uh with another another
[00:34:16] in prosperity who the [ __ ] levels
[00:34:19] I'm gonna assume he's diligence because
[00:34:21] I've never gold or something I haven't
[00:34:22] level trying okay who else is okay so
[00:34:24] let's say Okay so let's say it's hydro
[00:34:26] hydro it could be oh wait no no let's go
[00:34:28] by weapon so if it's not Claymore it's
[00:34:31] bow Bo from leeway yilon no you're not
[00:34:35] Prosperity she's not Prosperity 100
[00:34:36] gifted she's not Prosperity so
[00:34:40] actually I'm not betting 100 gifts in on
[00:34:42] that I don't actually know I don't think
[00:34:43] she's Prosperity but I'm not willing to
[00:34:45] gift 100 Subs so I'm not gonna say that
[00:34:47] okay wait is she well I actually don't

[00:35:18] it could be Claymore too it could be
[00:35:19] Claymore bow or Claymore
[00:35:22] unless you launched Prosperity if you
[00:35:24] lost Prosperity I look dumb because the
[00:35:25] only elements that are left are Hydro
[00:35:27] cryo that's it no no there's one more

[00:41:48] but
[00:41:50] good rotation he was timing that he
[00:41:52] Vaped his alt he Vaped his burst he was
[00:41:54] waiting he was like he was waiting to

[00:42:02] also to anyone who got jump scared when

[00:42:06] worry
[00:42:07] I I can't explain
[00:42:12] gearing incoming I don't need to gear
[00:42:15] I actually don't need to gear
[00:42:34] we're gonna do our weekly bounties
[00:42:44] daily fake story what do you mean a fake
[00:42:46] story dude I don't brag about it you
[00:42:48] guys ask I don't brag about it I'm not
[00:42:51] here trying to say that hey okay I may
[00:42:54] or may not I may or may not have had to
[00:42:57] travel the world to help those to
[00:42:59] literally dude I got caught okay if you
[00:43:01] got called by the president of a foreign
[00:43:04] Nation what are you gonna do evade
[00:43:06] [ __ ] evade your responsibilities no I
[00:43:09] went to help out uh a country in need
[00:43:11] and guess what I did
[00:43:13] so so what if I accept a small reward of
[00:43:16] 720 resin it's not even that much
[00:43:19] now for legal reasons I'm not going to
[00:43:21] disclose which country just know that
[00:43:23] happened
[00:43:25] I didn't I didn't want to bring it up
[00:43:26] you guys are asking
[00:43:30] I feel like you have a right as a viewer
[00:43:33] to know what's going on behind the
[00:43:35] scenes you have a right to know so why
[00:43:37] would I hide it from you
[00:43:48] no actually the um yeah the the resin
[00:43:51] the stream was uh
[00:43:58] Mr socks is key better on Carrara or
[00:44:01] should I use ER weapon I have key level
[00:44:03] one sign I am using level one dull blade
[00:44:06] on nilu as a true zai zero X Watcher
[00:44:09] okay
[00:44:09] what the [ __ ] is this question yes you
[00:44:12] should use your key but if you also are
[00:44:14] using nilu you should probably put it on
[00:44:16] nilu but yes you should be using your
[00:44:18] key
[00:44:19] the point okay doll blade is optimal
[00:44:22] because it lets you not pull for key but
[00:44:24] if you already have key [ __ ] use it
[00:44:28] but uh level one double blade is pretty
[00:44:30] based so I respect it
[00:44:35] I did 12-1 bottom half with yai and
[00:44:39] and that sounds dude if you play yai no
[00:44:42] shields in the second half you should
[00:44:43] get booked a free therapy session like
[00:44:45] from hoyo like it should be like on the
[00:44:48] house complimentary [ __ ] therapy
[00:44:50] session for your struggles for having to
[00:44:52] play yai Miko on field with no Shields
[00:45:02] which one is a chad
[00:45:05] wait if I single pull it'll tell me
[00:45:07] which one it is watch
[00:45:09] watch you may be like Ozarks you weren't

[00:45:19] Sharpshooters oath three stars there's
[00:45:22] three tunnels one two three

[00:45:31] okay at the end okay at the end they
[00:45:33] split up like I was like kind of looking
[00:45:35] and then both of them kind of went near
[00:45:37] the same spot and that I couldn't
[00:45:38] [ __ ] tell anymore

[00:48:01] then you get C1 maybe you got like a
[00:48:03] lucky five so you have C2 it is what it
[00:48:05] is how do you get the C4
[00:48:08] that is
[00:48:10] probably the worst constellation in any
[00:48:13] video game ever to be launched

[00:48:40] okay I didn't know it [ __ ] overwrite

[00:48:51] also dude I saw
[00:48:55] I play it I think I will on stream but I
[00:48:58] was thinking about if I'm ever gonna

[00:49:10] or like dragon's Bane or some [ __ ]
[00:49:15] and
[00:49:21] cause I have so many Instagram anyways I
[00:49:22] I finished the first game it was really
[00:49:24] good

[00:49:40] appreciate it
[00:49:48] you'll fish on RuneScape but not genchin
[00:49:50] okay first of all the only reason I'm
[00:49:52] playing a RuneScape right now is because
[00:49:53] I feel bad because I never get to play
[00:49:55] games as a Jeff and he's playing so I
[00:49:56] want to play with him second of all uh
[00:49:59] at least I'm acting like an AFK the [ __ ]
[00:50:01] I don't like and then play the [ __ ] I
[00:50:03] like
[00:50:03] I can't AFK fishing and gentian you have
[00:50:06] to like focus and then pymon's like
[00:50:08] [Music]

[00:50:24] Celestia best character I think Celeste
[00:50:26] is cool but they did her dirty I'm not
[00:50:28] gay no spoilers but I think the last
[00:50:30] like trial thing of hers they did her
[00:50:32] dirty or like the last one
[00:50:34] it is oh that was like low-key spoilers
[00:50:36] but I don't care the game's like 20
[00:50:38] years old [ __ ] you
[00:50:39] actually I do care sorry if it was
[00:50:41] whatever it doesn't matter
[00:50:43] play Persona I want to I actually
[00:50:45] launched Persona 5 but I didn't actually
[00:50:47] play it yet

[00:51:29] popcorn
[00:51:30] sit down I'll spend it soon
[00:51:34] dude I'm so sad about OverWatch they
[00:51:36] [ __ ] dude they made a second game
[00:51:37] just for PVE but then instead of
[00:51:39] actually getting SPV they [ __ ]
[00:51:40] paywalled it and then canceled it they
[00:51:42] canceled it and then pay walls what they
[00:51:44] already worked on dude why just [ __ ]
[00:51:47] bro they literally killed the game it
[00:51:49] was man-made kill the game the game was
[00:51:51] doing fine and then they chose to kill
[00:51:53] it
[00:51:55] I guess you can't balance a game and
[00:51:57] [ __ ] harass your employees at the
[00:51:59] same time allegedly but I guess it was
[00:52:01] like hard to balance the two but like
[00:52:02] why don't you just keep balancing the
[00:52:03] [ __ ] game and then not make a second
[00:52:05] one who the [ __ ] makes a second game in
[00:52:08] the year of 2020 onwards
[00:52:21] I still play the game though
[00:52:25] all right let's go uh finish our daily
[00:52:27] where the [ __ ] my last daily I feel
[00:52:29] like oh there it is
[00:52:30] thank you
[00:52:37] if there's just a reskin never like okay
[00:52:40] here isn't the thing is they stopped
[00:52:42] development of one to focus on the PVE
[00:52:44] of two and then the PVE of two didn't
[00:52:46] come so what the [ __ ] did they stop to
[00:52:48] focus on one for that's like if gentians
[00:52:50] like Hey we're gonna stop releasing
[00:52:52] characters and regions and the rest will
[00:52:53] be in Genji impact too and then Genji
[00:52:55] impact 2 gets canceled
[00:52:58] like what the [ __ ] is happening why how
[00:53:01] does that even happen
[00:53:03] I can't wait till we get shangling too
[00:53:07] foreign
[00:53:26] wait what
[00:53:31] oh okay I thought you were I thought you

[00:53:49] TCG oh my God I just saw the new on this
[00:53:52] weapon I forgot we got [ __ ] let alone
[00:53:54] one good girls but two or two but I
[00:53:57] don't know how you say that sentence but
[00:53:58] I actually forgot we got these [ __ ]
[00:54:01] came from your YouTube and then I
[00:54:03] watched a Channel of Your Clips
[00:54:07] weapon BC I hate myself
[00:54:12] weapon because I hate myself wait why do
[00:54:15] you need to hate yourself to pull on
[00:54:16] that weapon what's wrong with I mean
[00:54:18] okay it's it's it's not as good as like
[00:54:20] Jade cutter but it's funny yeah if you
[00:54:22] like I like them you know treat yourself
[00:54:25] the batter's okay the batter's okay
[00:54:27] there's like five and stuff on it
[00:54:35] okay let me let me specify weapon
[00:54:37] matters suck but as far as weapon
[00:54:39] matters go it's okay if you needed the
[00:54:41] weapons
[00:54:43] oh [ __ ] I'm entering Great Britain is it
[00:54:45] gonna kick me out
[00:54:46] oh we're fine
[00:54:56] do you ever come to Conquest yes but two
[00:54:58] things one didn't invite me and two
[00:54:59] apparently the staff mistreated a bunch
[00:55:01] of people and it was sus and annoying
[00:55:03] and I heard from the people inside that
[00:55:04] like some people were being
[00:55:06] weird so hopefully it gets fixed
[00:55:10] so yeah
[00:55:12] massage to anyone who got scammed well
[00:55:15] not I don't know if it was yeah I don't
[00:55:16] know everything so I'm not gonna like
[00:55:17] pretend I do but
[00:55:33] okay so a good question if I were to get
[00:55:35] a weapon
[00:55:36] sword which is better atar one Jade
[00:55:39] sword or missed since both good weapons
[00:55:42] Jade
[00:55:47] [ __ ] you I'm not answering that question
[00:55:49] depends on who you play if you play like
[00:55:51] icon [ __ ] and you could damage go Miss
[00:55:52] Twitter
[00:55:57] but if not Jade is pretty pretty poggers
[00:56:06] is better than say you at ziox okay
[00:56:10] someone banned that guy
[00:56:24] should I leave the nine months
[00:56:29] Frick you minus nine also chat I was
[00:56:32] playing okay so I was clearing what the
[00:56:34] [ __ ] there's a there's an eat a zoom
[00:56:36] Oculus over here anyways I was playing
[00:56:38] with should I go get it [ __ ] it uh yeah
[00:56:40] [ __ ] it
[00:56:41] am I gonna die I was right there
[00:56:44] anyways I was playing I was doing the
[00:56:46] abyss and my first half was running like
[00:56:48] venti right
[00:56:50] and it was dude it would either clear
[00:56:52] really fast when I would like get a
[00:56:54] venti every rotation or it would be like
[00:56:56] the most despair [ __ ] Agony and then
[00:56:59] I'd have like one minute for the second
[00:57:00] half and then yeah yeah it was it was it
[00:57:04] was a mixed bag of emotions
[00:57:13] so I've noticed that
[00:57:14] stuff
[00:57:18] okay I'm gonna say it you know how like
[00:57:20] you get bad at dodging if you play Jeong
[00:57:22] Li I think you get like
[00:57:24] you like get bad at dodging if you're
[00:57:27] relying on Jeong Lee right I think you
[00:57:29] also
[00:57:31] get dependent on kazua if you have him
[00:57:34] and then stop using him like
[00:57:36] like I don't know how to explain it like
[00:57:38] even just like his grouping like you
[00:57:40] kind of just depend on him even when you
[00:57:42] don't need him like there could be a
[00:57:44] abyss and like a team where like sucrose
[00:57:46] is more damage and is like objectively
[00:57:48] just more damage but it's like annoying
[00:57:50] to like group them with her and then you
[00:57:52] like are a Kazo added so you're like
[00:57:54] used to kazua and then you swap off Kazu
[00:57:56] and you don't know how to act
[00:57:57] I feel like that's me sometimes
[00:58:09] midnight fantastic
[00:58:15] and if that's true for me and I would
[00:58:17] like to argue I would like to believe
[00:58:19] that most gentian players other like you
[00:58:21] guys in chat you guys are like already
[00:58:23] too far gone but I talk about like
[00:58:25] casual gunship players I would like to
[00:58:26] assume that like the vast majority of
[00:58:28] gunship players are not as mechanically
[00:58:30] gifted intricately talented and
[00:58:33] constructed the way that I am in a sense
[00:58:35] that the the quality of life that he
[00:58:38] brings is even higher than it would
[00:58:39] bring me
[00:58:44] good
[00:58:51] and you want the what the [ __ ] up part
[00:58:53] is I can say all of those incredible
[00:58:55] amazing qualities
[00:59:00] and then if someone asks if he's a must
[00:59:01] pull the answer is still objectively no
[00:59:04] because it depends
[00:59:13] [Music]
[00:59:19] fateful offering
[00:59:22] Joe Jeff ratio
[00:59:26] okay
[00:59:32] time to go
[00:59:34] well okay to be fair because I've also
[00:59:37] watched what's the Jeff had to say is
[00:59:39] the Jeff that doesn't say
[00:59:41] if he's in chat he's gonna be like ratio
[00:59:42] [ __ ] you but assuming he's not in chat
[00:59:44] so Jeff doesn't just say
[00:59:49] yeah he doesn't just say oh sucrose
[00:59:51] better he says they're about as good but
[00:59:53] I say sucrose is better because it's
[00:59:55] more click bait and it helps right the
[00:59:57] wrong of people overhyping the character
[00:59:58] which I don't disagree with I just
[01:00:01] personally think the only thing I do
[01:00:03] disagree with is I personally think that
[01:00:04] for like 99 of players the convenience
[01:00:06] and like the other [ __ ] that he gives
[01:00:08] makes him feel a lot better to where in
[01:00:11] practice he'll be a lot better than like
[01:00:13] yeah it'll just be a lot better in
[01:00:15] practice
[01:00:17] not a lot better like I don't think he's
[01:00:18] like a lot better than other characters
[01:00:19] but a lot better than
[01:00:21] how you would think of him without
[01:00:23] factoring that
[01:00:25] also he's good for your account
[01:00:28] is it true that sucrose feels funky bro
[01:00:30] you player him her sucrose we're talking
[01:00:32] with sucrose I'm tired I wasn't sure
[01:00:34] we're talking about cause or sucrose you
[01:00:36] player
[01:00:38] by Royal Decree
[01:00:42] one with nature
[01:00:47] the freedom plane leaves my body when
[01:00:50] sucrose accidentally infuses a random
[01:00:52] ass element when sucrose infuses Hydro
[01:00:54] when playing a [ __ ] a [ __ ] jail
[01:00:57] team no I guess you can't Infuse Geo
[01:00:59] once you infuses pyro when you're
[01:01:00] playing [ __ ] aggravate that's when
[01:01:02] that's when the free-to-player leaves my
[01:01:04] body
[01:01:05] that's when you have to must pull
[01:01:08] as you wish me
[01:01:12] Wendy Rock

[01:04:05] enemies are danger resistant but in
[01:04:07] general no

[01:09:33] show I was like top one percent isn't he
[01:09:39] my shot was literally top one percent
[01:09:41] why the [ __ ] could I did I could be rank
[01:09:44] one but like is it even worth it anymore
[01:09:49] are my eyes those already like the best
[01:09:51] I have one two six yeah
[01:09:55] did I have I have this is my ratio I
[01:09:58] have a one two six em
[01:10:06] this is like hutau would be so good
[01:10:12] yeah
[01:10:13] uh maybe I go for a bit of like 120 ER
[01:10:16] so again the other bracket so I'm more
[01:10:18] top one percent cheating the system
[01:10:22] sorry
[01:10:40] well that's 128. foreign
[01:10:51] which flower is my best is this one
[01:10:57] yeah probably
[01:11:00] what's up Nick I don't ask for much but
[01:11:02] please add it's important to me the [ __ ]
[01:11:04] is oh
[01:11:06] what's up uh I like
[01:11:15] dude what the [ __ ] is this emote
[01:11:18] this is terrible
[01:11:21] number one on trending
[01:11:24] well I can't even add it I'm not signed
[01:11:27] in the [ __ ]
[01:11:34] yeah I added it but this is what ah dude
[01:11:37] what the [ __ ] is this
[01:11:39] all right
[01:11:42] you're welcome that's for the gamble mod
[01:11:45] for our local our resident our local
[01:11:47] resident Gamba addict
[01:11:59] Let me refresh chat
[01:12:02] okay good
[01:12:03] also Chad you know how like sometimes
[01:12:05] when you don't listen your teacher will
[01:12:07] be like all right if you guys aren't
[01:12:08] gonna listen you're all in timeout okay
[01:12:10] that's what I'm gonna do now if you guys
[01:12:12] can't [ __ ] unanimously decide on
[01:12:14] where I should spend my resin then we're
[01:12:15] gonna go Vermillion while you guys are
[01:12:17] in timeout and the tool you can make a
[01:12:19] unanimous decision we're gonna be in
[01:12:22] Vermillion and so we as a class
[01:12:26] as a collective can decide
[01:12:29] my throat hurts now
[01:12:33] ow
[01:12:44] wow
[01:12:47] my only DPS is
[01:12:49] like I really like I like them and I
[01:12:52] think he's a good addition to your
[01:12:53] account if you need a DPS but causal is
[01:12:55] always going to be more valuable almost
[01:12:56] always
[01:12:58] like okay here's how it works right
[01:13:00] I deleted my DMs okay is it Jeff
[01:13:04] wazer
[01:13:06] actually I can't show this in my cams
[01:13:08] blocking it but it should go like
[01:13:11] hmm
[01:13:29] hey look this is pull value right
[01:13:34] this is full value right
[01:13:37] this is pull value right but where's
[01:13:39] where's there for a benchmark
[01:13:43] okay this is full value right for
[01:13:44] Benchmark okay perfect
[01:13:49] where's Kazo
[01:13:50] is this Kazo this is Kazo and Beto isn't
[01:13:53] that like MC or some [ __ ] I feel like
[01:13:55] people use this as something else
[01:13:59] it's like
[01:14:01] as far as DPS is but never as valuable
[01:14:07] as supports but this guy is close to
[01:14:10] that since he's very versatile and good
[01:14:14] teams and dendro is broken so this is
[01:14:17] kind of where where I would put the pull
[01:14:19] value to your list it would be like some
[01:14:21] good support characters and then I'll
[01:14:22] hide them and then like some of the like
[01:14:24] mid support characters or
[01:14:26] um there's probably another tier of
[01:14:28] support characters in the middle stay in
[01:14:30] the middle
[01:14:32] uh how do I move it
[01:14:36] Hydro options are amazing but you only
[01:14:39] need like one to two per account then
[01:14:42] the value becomes mid at best so only
[01:14:47] get some to get and then it's like
[01:14:51] where is yelling
[01:14:53] like you know like this [ __ ]
[01:14:55] like depending on who you have you're
[01:14:57] gonna be where's where's [ __ ]
[01:15:01] and then child if you play like
[01:15:03] shangling tell me why shangly so like
[01:15:06] that's it you got me
[01:15:08] it's like you get me it's like there's
[01:15:09] only a few Hydro like you don't need
[01:15:10] every Hydro supporting or every Hydro
[01:15:12] character in the game once you have like
[01:15:13] one or two you're chilling like you do
[01:15:14] sing show one half and then like could
[01:15:16] call me the other or I to the other or
[01:15:17] child other or your lawn Synchro and one
[01:15:20] team and then once you have like you
[01:15:21] don't need all of them and then after
[01:15:23] that it's like you want like DBS as far
[01:15:25] as DBS characters like there
[01:15:27] basically
[01:15:28] but
[01:15:30] and then there's like other support
[01:15:31] characters
[01:15:42] put YULA there too true actually
[01:15:45] actually wait
[01:15:47] add a row above
[01:15:50] Tony toe Tick Tock DPS insane click here
[01:16:02] 200 things to consider about EULA
[01:16:07] this is how the pull value goes this is
[01:16:11] full value
[01:16:14] but yeah so like it's like I put him a
[01:16:18] bit above the other devices in terms of
[01:16:19] pull value not necessarily in terms of
[01:16:21] how good he is well yes in terms of but
[01:16:23] it turns out it is like c0r1 or r0
[01:16:26] because like example is like a lot of
[01:16:28] hyper carries kinda okay I was lurking
[01:16:31] instead of stream when he said this and
[01:16:32] I agree like a lot of the um
[01:16:35] a lot of the like the bait of hyper
[01:16:37] carries is like they become really good
[01:16:38] like their finances they're over then
[01:16:40] they become really good with either like
[01:16:42] C1
[01:16:44] or C2 or R1 weapon or usually cons and
[01:16:48] weapons so like example ride is a really
[01:16:50] good unit but then for her to be like
[01:16:52] really good hyper carry you kind of want
[01:16:53] C2 and or engulfing same with like she's
[01:16:56] good then C1 R1 becomes way better Xiao
[01:17:00] does any cons but his Jade sphere or any
[01:17:02] five star weapon makes them quite a bit
[01:17:03] better and then it's like there's a lot
[01:17:05] of characters like that although yeah
[01:17:07] but then I'll hide them it's like his
[01:17:09] team does so much like there's a lot of
[01:17:10] the damage and he relies on Dental
[01:17:11] reactions which are broken so it's like
[01:17:13] you don't actually like he's a bit less
[01:17:15] of a hyper carry
[01:17:17] which is a good thing because then it's
[01:17:18] like at Baseline his teams perform like
[01:17:20] usually better
[01:17:27] tell me why shangly
[01:17:40] laughs
[01:17:43] dude inserted Xiao as hyper carry listen
[01:17:46] you're allowed to not like ciao but he's
[01:17:48] definitely played as a hyper carry and
[01:17:49] built as a hyper carry what are you
[01:17:50] talking about
[01:17:53] the [ __ ] are you talking about
[01:17:54] [Music]
[01:18:00] he's like the definition he is the
[01:18:01] literally the poster boy of a hyper
[01:18:03] carry you literally play three NPC
[01:18:06] supports and Xiao that's how you play a
[01:18:08] shout team
[01:18:10] people called DeLuca hyper carry when
[01:18:12] [ __ ] singtra did more damage than him
[01:18:16] when the singjo batted in the deluke
[01:18:18] team did more damage than the deluke
[01:18:22] stand back
[01:18:29] literally just travel
[01:18:46] oh it's not gonna screw that much I will
[01:18:50] actually not
[01:18:58] bars on out damaged him farzan is a
[01:19:01] waste of a [ __ ] farzan should not
[01:19:03] have constellations her C6 should be her
[01:19:05] base kit or she shouldn't be released
[01:19:08] that's my take on farzan C6 should be
[01:19:10] her base
[01:19:11] I think her design is [ __ ] dog [ __ ]
[01:19:13] absolute waste of a [ __ ] unit but
[01:19:15] she's really good for animal characters
[01:19:16] if you have seasick I just think this
[01:19:18] should be in the base kit or C2 like at
[01:19:20] least with Zara it's C2 this should be
[01:19:22] your [ __ ] C2 shouldn't be your C6 it
[01:19:24] actually tells me that he thinks because
[01:19:25] because that means that like anytime I
[01:19:26] talk about farazan for anyone who
[01:19:28] doesn't have a C6 it's like a completely
[01:19:29] different unit
[01:19:32] I like her like I think I love her as a
[01:19:35] Nemo [ __ ] enjoyer that I am but it's
[01:19:37] just like tilting but you need C6 for it
[01:19:39] to be that good
[01:19:40] but also people are like
[01:19:43] to be fair
[01:19:51] um
[01:19:54] yeah I still think like
[01:20:08] like there's a like like when when uh
[01:20:10] farzan first drops a lot of the like
[01:20:13] when you compare c0r1 characters like
[01:20:15] dps's in the abyss like the the teams
[01:20:18] xiao's like up there but then people are
[01:20:21] like okay well it depends on C6 bars on
[01:20:22] which is like true but then it's like
[01:20:24] the longer the game goes on the more
[01:20:26] it's gonna be accessible but also also
[01:20:28] times two
[01:20:31] um
[01:20:32] I don't think that's a unit he depends
[01:20:33] on her at all he kind of depends on a
[01:20:35] good team like you kind of want Bennett
[01:20:37] if you're not running for his own
[01:20:38] because why the [ __ ] would you run a
[01:20:39] shot Team without Bennett but that
[01:20:41] doesn't mean you need her
[01:20:43] because like yeah he does okay think of
[01:20:45] it this way
[01:20:47] before farzan and also the clears we do
[01:20:50] without farzan he still performs better
[01:20:52] than like the average he performs better
[01:20:53] than the average carry but not better
[01:20:55] than like
[01:20:56] I like I don't know there's like a
[01:20:59] threshold
[01:21:00] uh I can pull it up I don't have the
[01:21:03] [ __ ] because the the Sim only shows
[01:21:05] single Target oh no it doesn't actually
[01:21:06] show us two
[01:21:10] like some of his teams are copium
[01:21:14] but I think that's just team building
[01:21:16] like some people are just dumb
[01:21:18] it's like you play xiaofars on Ben and
[01:21:20] then if you're not playing that team you
[01:21:21] don't know what the [ __ ] to build
[01:21:24] my bro your child's not average okay
[01:21:25] look
[01:21:28] okay this is my shout on Vermilion which
[01:21:30] is worse than my other build okay I'm on
[01:21:31] beginner's protector I won't use any of
[01:21:33] my characters other than Bennett
[01:21:35] but honestly need my energy not have
[01:21:36] energy
[01:21:42] like okay is the actually Bennett kind
[01:21:44] of yeah but like still right
[01:21:49] like in any AOE situation you're gonna
[01:21:51] perform well if it's not AOE you're not
[01:21:52] like single Target shot was like okay
[01:21:54] age it's not amazing it's not very good
[01:22:01] yeah
[01:22:04] one with nature
[01:22:06] oh yeah
[01:22:13] who the [ __ ] isn't dead oh
[01:22:17] 30k is average no not with Bennett do
[01:22:19] you think 30k punches with Bennett
[01:22:21] noblesse is average that's not true
[01:22:45] you shot every playground let's see my
[01:22:47] Shadows 20K plunges on black Cliff pole
[01:22:50] two-piece Berserker two-piece Wanderers
[01:22:52] four star artifacts and Bennett
[01:22:57] ar-45
[01:23:05] who the [ __ ] are you comparing him to
[01:23:06] Shang Ling yes where's the Chang Ling
[01:23:10] well just depends on the car that you're
[01:23:11] doing also dendro a lot of Abyss these
[01:23:13] danger reactions so you kind of want
[01:23:15] that minus six months
[01:23:20] yeah
[01:23:22] cheers
[01:23:42] doesn't matter backwards that much
[01:23:44] they're pretty similar though
[01:23:45] you know what shot Wanderer convos it's
[01:23:47] not a convo when the [ __ ] has there ever
[01:23:49] been a Xiao Wanderer convo
[01:23:52] the only times Wander can perform better
[01:23:54] is if you're playing him taser in which
[01:23:55] case just goes sucrose
[01:24:02] laughs
[01:24:11] the way you know it yeah
[01:24:19] [Music]
[01:24:24] okay who needs friendship
[01:24:27] ah is my new adventure 10 already
[01:24:30] seven okay we need to actually but my
[01:24:34] other character's all friendship 10.
[01:24:36] unless they do like a Kirara baiju thing
[01:24:39] we could do like nilu Kirara baiju
[01:24:44] it might be very copium though
[01:24:54] we'll need a strategy we'll need a
[01:24:57] strategy
[01:24:59] Barbara we could
[01:25:01] the [ __ ] ring will follow Kirara
[01:25:04] but I don't know if we'll actually be
[01:25:05] able to like one rotate this
[01:25:26] wait what the [ __ ] is my two piece again
[01:25:28] uh
[01:25:30] uh varukasha
[01:25:38] for rukasha's glow
[01:25:42] wait and then where the [ __ ] is milith
[01:25:50] lunch [ __ ]
[01:25:58] wait did I get an HP MILF oh I did all
[01:26:01] right let's level this
[01:26:04] Chad what are we thinking I'm thinking
[01:26:05] it goes all into ER maybe crit rate
[01:26:11] okay I mean this is good for nilu I mean
[01:26:15] it's fine for nulu I mean the defense
[01:26:17] isn't but whatever I guess yeah whatever
[01:26:22] that's fine for newly that's fine it's
[01:26:25] fine it's fine it's fine
[01:26:29] it's not amazing but it looks fine
[01:26:33] ah you don't need a piece whatever I
[01:26:36] need the piece
[01:26:38] of it
[01:26:49] um and then kokomi wants
[01:26:51] foreign
[01:27:17] also characters who so this is another
[01:27:20] shangling buff but characters who depend
[01:27:22] on Bennett are a lot less of a hindrance
[01:27:26] now because your other team oftentimes
[01:27:29] doesn't need Bennett because usually you
[01:27:30] run one danger team like if you're
[01:27:32] playing like a relatively good teams a
[01:27:34] lot of the abysses will like kind of
[01:27:36] force you to have at least one dendro
[01:27:37] team right so you're usually running
[01:27:39] like hyperbloom Bloom I'll hide like
[01:27:40] whatever the [ __ ] you run right so other
[01:27:42] than one of your teams will have like
[01:27:44] Nikita maybe sing Cho that kind of [ __ ]
[01:27:46] the shangling but you get it like Nikita
[01:27:48] like Dental character [ __ ] Hydro
[01:27:50] character Electro character whatever and
[01:27:52] then your other team will have Bennett
[01:27:54] so like characters that want Bennett
[01:27:57] um it's definitely like a downside like
[01:28:00] okay this character needs Bennett but
[01:28:04] um
[01:28:05] it's not as like I feel like there's so
[01:28:08] many teams now that don't need Bennett
[01:28:09] he's still in my opinion like the best
[01:28:11] unit but it's like the fact that you can
[01:28:13] use him on one team and not feel that
[01:28:14] bad because you can run a dendro team
[01:28:15] that doesn't need him is pretty good
[01:28:18] it all comes back to Xiao which means
[01:28:20] you can use bet it on ciao
[01:28:31] what am I doing by the way what the [ __ ]
[01:28:32] is my what the [ __ ] am I rotating right
[01:28:34] now
[01:28:42] dude why am I okay I don't know what the
[01:28:45] [ __ ] I just did let me decided reserves
[01:28:46] it
[01:28:47] we'll try again next time I'll try again
[01:28:49] next time
[01:28:53] wait who's my deepwood characters
[01:29:01] how will Fontan change I
[01:29:04] actually look like I've been to Fontan

[01:29:10] how the [ __ ] would I know have I been to
[01:29:12] fonten
[01:29:13] laughs
[01:29:24] boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
[01:29:46] what's the time
[01:29:48] out of curiosity
[01:29:51] and viosity what sorry
[01:30:06] I can't find what I'm looking for though
[01:30:07] in a second uh I'll show when I find it

[01:31:29] I was looking through my email playlist
[01:31:30] because we're playing child today I'm
[01:31:32] not Charmaine today
[01:31:37] it's a bit loud now
[01:31:44] we are a shout player today a true

[01:31:50] um yeah
[01:31:56] wait also the best part of my Asia
[01:31:58] account is we have a c04 that is my
[01:32:01] greatest accomplishment we caught the c0
[01:32:03] farzan on scarra's Banner so we actually
[01:32:07] get the experience the [ __ ] 300 ER
[01:32:09] requirement I can't [ __ ] wait I
[01:32:12] actually get this is gonna help me not
[01:32:13] be out of touch like I don't want to be
[01:32:15] out of touch when I'm like getting used
[01:32:16] to like a C6 [ __ ] luxury Horizons so
[01:32:19] I can't wait for that it's gonna be
[01:32:20] [ __ ] great
[01:32:24] that's actually great
[01:32:37] you didn't get free fires on no no I
[01:32:39] didn't do events on that count that
[01:32:40] account is like the last event I did was
[01:32:42] festering desire
[01:32:44] in like 1.2 or some [ __ ]
[01:32:48] won't put what I don't know the last
[01:32:50] thing that I did was festering desire
[01:33:01] taking the turn
[01:33:04] please
[01:33:09] is QR better than Yaya for nearly Bloom
[01:33:11] so I think what it is is Yaya will give
[01:33:14] you more damage in AOE especially and
[01:33:16] here I will give you more Comfort by
[01:33:18] having a shield that protects you from
[01:33:19] Bloom so in this current Abyss I'd
[01:33:20] rather be shielded but in a lot of
[01:33:22] content yeah yeah would be better I
[01:33:23] think
[01:33:26] team counts are kind of scuffed though
[01:33:28] like I don't yeah I also just for those
[01:33:31] things I yeah
[01:33:43] let's move out
[01:33:52] can you do I'll hide them juice pack
[01:33:55] opening what the [ __ ] is that I'll hide
[01:33:58] them juice pack opening
[01:34:05] when I'm blooming with dandruffs

[01:34:37] if we get a if I already look all the
[01:34:39] rules crew damage I'm probably done yeah

[01:35:06] allowed if I am dude yeah yeah I'm doing
[01:35:09] that [ __ ]
[01:35:12] like I want to play it myself that's the
[01:35:14] experience but dude I don't want to fish
[01:35:16] again man I I do not want a fish
[01:35:21] all right it doesn't have screw damage
[01:35:23] 25 gifted because I'm in a good mood
[01:35:30] well
[01:35:32] at least I still uh I thought I spilled
[01:35:34] my coffee but at least I save money
[01:35:38] oh this could get accurate damage
[01:35:47] give us your account we won't do
[01:35:48] anything bad it's a free-to-play ar-44
[01:35:53] Asia server account with like basically
[01:35:55] nothing
[01:35:57] that like like what the like I don't
[01:35:59] know it's not like it's like there's
[01:36:00] anything special on it it just has Eula
[01:36:03] Dev account
[01:36:05] that's it as you love that's Eula and
[01:36:07] Xiao
[01:36:15] oh
[01:36:20] oh Jeepers this is probably Gonna Roll
[01:36:22] [ __ ] terribly but you know let's at
[01:36:24] least milk it whoa Max roll crit damage
[01:36:27] Maxwell criterate I wonder how this
[01:36:29] could go
[01:36:33] rarest account ever actually
[01:36:36] if they don't do a Eula rerun better
[01:36:38] next patch I can my account becomes so
[01:36:41] valuable I can Flex

[01:36:52] remember
[01:36:53] foreign

[01:37:16] 2949 or 2749
[01:37:20] it's a pretty decent amount of HP
[01:37:30] foreign
[01:38:06] oh I need this boss for [ __ ] uh
[01:38:09] Candace and fires on we're gonna do this
[01:38:10] boss I forgot about that
[01:38:41] your taste in songs are so emo bro this

[01:38:45] in like [ __ ] three months okay I
[01:38:49] played a playlist titled emo what do you
[01:38:52] mean it is one playlist
[01:38:59] how is he already invisible
[01:39:10] oh
[01:39:12] Dead with me right now emerge right now
[01:39:18] [ __ ]
[01:39:23] oh it's not item build is he still on
[01:39:24] deepwood okay
[01:39:27] we don't talk about that I was recording
[01:39:30] a virgin team well yeah we don't talk
[01:39:32] about it
[01:39:33] wait what the Bro show me the goblet
[01:39:38] where's the goblet
[01:39:43] no pundra hide them dude you don't
[01:39:45] understand the trauma I got fighting the
[01:39:49] consecrated Beast trying to plunge right
[01:39:50] around my burst so I would do like hold
[01:39:52] e and then as soon as I did it they
[01:39:54] would [ __ ] knock me and I didn't get
[01:39:55] the punch I would do this and then I'd
[01:39:57] Die it was actually impossible so I gave
[01:40:00] up I I actually can't do it anymore it's
[01:40:02] actually [ __ ]
[01:40:04] although granted usually you start your
[01:40:06] rotation with your burst so it doesn't
[01:40:07] matter like you're not supposed to not
[01:40:09] have your burst but yeah if you don't
[01:40:14] what happened to crit Comey we're gonna
[01:40:24] Al hyphen is so green what the [ __ ] does
[01:40:26] that mean
[01:40:28] that is his element yes
[01:40:32] I wonder if we got some good artifacts I
[01:40:34] didn't level like while I was playing
[01:40:35] Star rail
[01:40:36] um
[01:40:37] surely surely we have a ton of good
[01:40:39] artifacts right surely
[01:40:41] like this could be good
[01:40:45] [Music]
[01:41:14] thank you
[01:41:28] okay I don't know what I was expecting
[01:41:31] but I whatever I mean that's only one
[01:41:34] piece It's Only One Piece One Beat wait
[01:41:36] I needed one of these Sands I forgot I
[01:41:38] needed a Sandstone I think I need an em
[01:41:41] or em gilded Sands as well because my
[01:41:44] all items Sans is like his worst piece
[01:41:46] after doing offset one so maybe we do
[01:41:48] have to far more gilded
[01:41:58] the [ __ ] is this
[01:42:10] hmm
[01:42:12] maybe we should level all of our lock
[01:42:14] pieces because that's so many we'll
[01:42:16] start with this one I guess
[01:42:28] why'd they give 10 fuel on Star rail
[01:42:30] that was because of me so I actually
[01:42:31] they were like yeah that was actually
[01:42:33] because of me I told them I said hey
[01:42:34] could we please get some more fuel in
[01:42:36] Star rail because I really need some so
[01:42:38] I could keep farming to say hey anything
[01:42:39] for you but it would be a bit unfair if
[01:42:42] we gave it to you and to no one else
[01:42:43] people might be like a bit like annoyed
[01:42:45] so we're gonna give it to everyone
[01:42:52] uh uh maybe question mark
[01:43:02] oh we got 36 Stars
[01:43:04] after the characters normal attack hits
[01:43:06] opponents damage dealt with his
[01:43:08] character oh [ __ ] all right so we have
[01:43:10] the normal attack from Xiao in between
[01:43:12] the plunges am I gonna remember nope
[01:43:16] okay so make sure no attack
[01:43:22] yoy Mia
[01:43:27] wow I can't wait to play yoi Mia
[01:43:31] why is Joey me a pot friend because
[01:43:34] you're Mia's pod friend
[01:43:35] I don't know I just it just it is what
[01:43:37] it is you can't you can't reinvent the
[01:43:40] wheel
[01:43:41] oh I really want to do this event we'll
[01:43:43] do that when it's like fully out I guess
[01:43:50] should I do all height I'm dirty on this
[01:43:52] trial I feel like you can't do all
[01:43:53] height and dirty I feel like I'll hit
[01:43:54] them always feels pretty good like this
[01:43:56] would have to be the worst team ever
[01:43:57] that's actually fine
[01:44:01] okay well official doesn't work here but
[01:44:04] should have plunged
[01:44:08] Wings Of Darkness the process of
[01:44:11] elimination
[01:44:18] is this the best even good for you and
[01:44:20] Mia
[01:44:20] [Music]
[01:44:24] you see what I mean
[01:44:26] every time I plan to get [ __ ] knocked
[01:44:30] it's like not like it's it's it's it's
[01:44:33] it's it's okay the bird yes but every
[01:44:37] character is gonna guess like the bird
[01:44:38] is easy and then 12-3 yes but again that
[01:44:42] one's usually easy so like the hard
[01:44:43] parts are either first half or uh second
[01:44:46] twelve one second half for first half
[01:44:48] she's not the best although you could
[01:44:50] use her but like she's not no she's not
[01:44:51] the best because it's two enemies and
[01:44:53] then second half she's fine but for 12-1
[01:44:56] it's hard because she only hits one of
[01:44:58] the two parados
[01:44:59] usually so I don't really unless you're
[01:45:02] playing like
[01:45:04] yeah
[01:45:06] unless they're playing like you'd
[01:45:07] probably need Bennett kozua swirl pyro
[01:45:10] on kazua then go like sing show for the
[01:45:13] hydro [ __ ] no but then you have nothing
[01:45:15] to break the [ __ ] Hydra field I mean
[01:45:16] I guess you just brute force it but yeah
[01:45:18] and then you owe me a
[01:45:22] because if you do you wake me up birth I
[01:45:25] spit over here if you do a virgin the
[01:45:27] odds of you like your pyro might not be
[01:45:29] enough it might be but it like when I
[01:45:31] played it it was like
[01:45:32] it was really tight and we didn't get it
[01:45:45] just use welt
[01:45:55] he does pull value is so ridiculous yes
[01:45:57] that is why that is why this tier list
[01:46:00] exists this is actually accurate and
[01:46:02] factual by the way accurate and factual
[01:46:05] they is here by the way actually no
[01:46:07] she's not okay Dave's here by the way
[01:46:09] actually no she's not okay Des here by
[01:46:12] the way
[01:46:21] I want Beto footage so I'll probably use
[01:46:22] beta for 12 maybe but I also want to
[01:46:24] play Shout
[01:46:25] but we do two clears those are shopping
[01:46:27] and then a bit okay true
[01:46:35] foreign
[01:46:47] but every like literally every Abyss I
[01:46:50] try Xiao in both halves I'm like I might
[01:46:52] as well try second dude this has to be
[01:46:53] the worst second half ever like the
[01:46:56] viewers like it feels like a waste like
[01:46:59] you don't have a flex lot usually teams
[01:47:01] have a flex slot like usually it's like
[01:47:03] dude this team dude this Abyss does not
[01:47:05] like in second half you don't
[01:47:07] yeah
[01:47:09] so it's kind of [ __ ]
[01:47:15] all right floor nine
[01:47:23] also to those wondering like
[01:47:25] keep in mind that a lot of like carries
[01:47:27] have like a lot of [ __ ] that give them
[01:47:30] innate Great Value right like Xiao guys
[01:47:32] like 21 or whatever the [ __ ] 19 plus
[01:47:35] five that's 24. 24 great from his
[01:47:38] Ascension and then a weapon the Husker
[01:47:39] like all those weapons have created
[01:47:40] unless you're playing [ __ ] like
[01:47:41] [ __ ] what is this weapon called
[01:47:43] [ __ ] missive win spear you probably
[01:47:46] have credit on your weapon and that's
[01:47:47] the same with like a lot of like hotel
[01:47:49] and [ __ ]
[01:47:53] um okay let's just send it so it happens
[01:47:56] wait why is it in the heat on
[01:48:05] are you play this public use some of
[01:48:07] them this one is exclamation mark twist
[01:48:09] I think
[01:48:13] dude chat look at how good my default
[01:48:15] hyphen is though look at look at this
[01:48:16] 72.8 245 153r 153 and we have the
[01:48:21] Amazons
[01:48:22] and is with a crit damage weapon
[01:48:25] but we're also missing a little bit like
[01:48:27] this is a lot of VR this because I was
[01:48:28] playing you might be like dude why do
[01:48:30] you have so much VR we are playing
[01:48:31] deepwood I'll hit them in a Solo dendro
[01:48:34] team I'll hide them Jalan Singh Cho
[01:48:36] kooky so we were we needed him on
[01:48:39] deepwood because if you put [ __ ] like
[01:48:40] Yolanda what are you doing
[01:48:44] but I probably want to bring him back to
[01:48:46] his normal build so we're gonna do that
[01:48:52] ciao shangling Bennett Fishel would be
[01:48:54] pretty good second half
[01:48:56] uh I mean
[01:49:04] I guess
[01:49:05] yeah I mean shell officials should be
[01:49:07] enough to pick the Hydra Shield
[01:49:09] then Pi yeah pyrolectors pirate is gonna
[01:49:11] be annoying but official could probably
[01:49:12] break through it for sure actually
[01:49:15] okay let me get him really fast so he's
[01:49:16] gonna oink all of nahida's [ __ ]
[01:49:18] oh because I don't need as much ER so I
[01:49:21] could do like this
[01:49:25] what was that Ox I just I just don't
[01:49:26] think are you gilded
[01:49:28] it better than uh Vermillion pieces
[01:49:30] despite farming Vermillion every day
[01:49:31] since it came out how is that possible
[01:49:33] yeah glad you noticed
[01:49:38] sorry
[01:49:39] um okay we need an em Sans
[01:49:44] [Music]
[01:49:58] not bad
[01:50:03] if you play
[01:50:06] yo yo Razer Chong Yoon Ito you dominate
[01:50:11] first half
[01:50:18] ah that has to be made the only thing
[01:50:21] you dominate is [ __ ] I mean maybe
[01:50:23] first half of floor nine
[01:50:27] okay Chad who should we play
[01:50:30] um
[01:50:33] scarra Venti
[01:50:35] farzan
[01:50:37] I don't think scarring forever farzan
[01:50:42] iao
[01:50:44] no we're not gonna swirl Wendy I got
[01:50:46] windy plaid [ __ ] it windy plant second
[01:50:48] half

[01:51:00] now you know actually no
[01:51:02] baiju
[01:51:08] Beto
[01:51:11] and then we probably want a grouper
[01:51:13] actually [ __ ] it we'll experience the
[01:51:15] sucrose we'll experience [ __ ] sucrose
[01:51:17] experience
[01:51:20] why not a crowd healers because windy
[01:51:22] plant so if you if you swirl dendro you
[01:51:24] actually get windy plant not yet but
[01:51:26] it's gonna come out trust so we're
[01:51:28] getting ready for the windy plant
[01:51:29] rotation
[01:51:39] they were actually blooming
[01:51:42] oh yeah

[01:53:21] last like
[01:53:22] yeah a long [ __ ] like at least like a
[01:53:25] month-ish
[01:53:26] but I probably will
[01:53:29] taking a turn for the better
[01:53:34] right now
[01:53:43] oh
[01:53:46] I don't know what took over me
[01:54:02] nice sucrose swirl nice [ __ ]

[01:55:05] Dory
[01:55:08] first half we're gonna play Kirara
[01:55:12] wait is my big Tonka t-level I mean gear
[01:55:15] I think so so we'll play Big T
[01:55:17] iwawa
[01:55:20] um
[01:55:22] Electro character Cookie
[01:55:25] actually we don't need a Healer the
[01:55:27] official
[01:55:28] and then EULA
[01:55:31] oh
[01:55:35] now we'll play leak leaked Euler footage
[01:55:37] actually
[01:55:43] I hate Dory so much we all do we all do
[01:55:46] that's all I'm playing here
[01:55:48] is a viable team let me think
[01:55:51] yeah baiju yes you have an aggravate
[01:55:54] team you have a swirly swirl you have
[01:55:56] two electrodes you have a dentro so you
[01:55:58] should be good
[01:56:03] once I shot I have to bank my lobsters

[01:56:08] needs the lobsters
[01:56:11] all right

[01:56:24] let's nip that in the butt
[01:56:28] well now we have the dendro cryo
[01:56:30] reaction
[01:56:33] fridge
[01:56:35] if there is a reaction what would it be
[01:56:36] called
[01:56:38] frozen plants
[01:56:51] you
[01:57:04] keep up
[01:57:07] Chad do you think I can get the new uh

[01:57:16] message for me and then every time
[01:57:17] someone stops he'll be like I'll nip you
[01:57:19] in the bud
[01:57:20] and then that's the sub sound dude I
[01:57:22] would pay I'd pay good money we sub goal
[01:57:25] it I'll pay good money
[01:57:52] foreign
[01:58:01] voice actors I want to meet I hope

[01:58:10] time for a
[01:58:13] box
[01:58:17] are you the time with the Wolves
[01:58:19] Graystone frog and then you lose it you
[01:58:21] lose actually good support because you
[01:58:22] can hold scarce on so just pull for a
[01:58:24] five star weapon and then she's a good
[01:58:25] support true just get a five star
[01:58:27] forehead true
[01:58:36] 100 gifted if I hit this
[01:58:39] 100 gifts did I hit this
[01:58:51] one with the forest
[01:58:54] it's my fault
[01:58:59] can you swap switching after Eula versus
[01:59:01] no it's optimal seems like an emergency
[01:59:14] does leveling up Cosmo from 80 to 90
[01:59:16] matter for grouping enemies no but it
[01:59:18] matters for everything about his kids to
[01:59:19] do it it kind of matters because you
[01:59:20] want to be within 20 levels of enemies
[01:59:22] to displace them better but the highest
[01:59:24] level enemies are 100 so 80 is enough
[01:59:25] but you should still get 90 because 90
[01:59:27] is important
[01:59:28] because it increases your scroll damage
[01:59:30] by a lot
[01:59:31] I think it's like 30 or some [ __ ] I know
[01:59:33] Bloom is like 34 but I assume sort of
[01:59:35] similar
[01:59:37] okay haha thanks Alex
[01:59:45] ah
[01:59:47] my work no rest for the wickets
[01:59:53] and shroud
[01:59:56] the event has not 100 enemies yeah but I
[01:59:58] just said
[02:00:00] if you would listen during class you
[02:00:03] wouldn't know that I said the highest
[02:00:05] level enemies are level 100 then within
[02:00:07] 20 levels includes 80. so 80 is fine
[02:00:14] but instead you're always on your phone
[02:00:24] thanks Dory
[02:00:26] process of elimination
[02:00:30] yeah also I don't know how my Eula did
[02:00:32] 300K randomly I didn't even know she was
[02:00:34] geared
[02:00:36] but I am the number one Eula main for a
[02:00:38] reason so true
[02:01:09] oh
[02:01:10] here you are
[02:01:13] okay good rotation
[02:01:15] all right 411 uh normal attack damage is
[02:01:18] increased this looks like a yoy Mia
[02:01:20] floor if I do say so myself
[02:01:23] let me see if my yomi is geared I mean I
[02:01:25] know she's gear but I don't know if she
[02:01:26] has a weapon
[02:01:35] yoy mirror
[02:01:37] okay
[02:01:57] who's better and Morgan thought
[02:02:00] play who you like
[02:02:02] but ciao
[02:02:08] how valuable is causeway's weapon no
[02:02:10] it's a good addition to your account but
[02:02:12] like no like Fab is is good she's five
[02:02:15] if your team needs energy use five if
[02:02:16] not you can get it it's good but it's
[02:02:18] not like
[02:02:19] it's not that good like it's good it's a
[02:02:22] good damage team increase but slimes
[02:02:25] Bob is um
[02:02:27] Bob
[02:02:38] okay what are we doing chat uh
[02:02:42] Bennett
[02:02:46] sing Cho

[02:03:05] gambling
[02:03:07] no death floor 11 dude I'm not gonna
[02:03:09] [ __ ] die on floor 11. why the [ __ ]
[02:03:12] would you even gamble that I'm not gonna
[02:03:14] die on floor 11.
[02:03:36] anyways uh I would normally run Ben in

[02:03:46] I don't know come on cookie just because
[02:03:48] wait who the [ __ ] is this guy oh Wicked
[02:03:51] Torrance never mind probably like
[02:03:55] where's baiju
[02:04:01] uh soccer five five unless like you
[02:04:05] because the thing with five is like
[02:04:07] people recommended on every single
[02:04:09] character always so like you might have
[02:04:11] like you could also do something like
[02:04:13] stop wood or something like if your
[02:04:14] other characters need fav but usually
[02:04:16] fav
[02:04:20] and Sack is fine and also sometimes like
[02:04:22] causes have like 10 Critters like if you
[02:04:24] have 10 crit rate use another weapon or
[02:04:26] use iron sting like legit like if you
[02:04:27] have 10 [ __ ] crit rate and you're
[02:04:29] going five what are you like it's not
[02:04:30] worth it
[02:04:32] unless you're hitting like 20 enemies at
[02:04:34] once
[02:04:39] yeah like at that point go ER stands and
[02:04:42] then yeah weapon

[02:11:03] the advisors null attacks are like the
[02:11:05] shortest smallest thing in the [ __ ]
[02:11:07] world also I might not even Three Star
[02:11:09] this because our team conference us we
[02:11:11] got him though we got it yeah we
[02:11:12] actually got it we actually got it
[02:11:13] remember health comes first
[02:11:24] you see that dude you see that movement
[02:11:26] how are you I footwork away from them
[02:11:31] laments
[02:11:33] [ __ ]
[02:11:37] okay I was like not to [ __ ] with
[02:11:39] actually
[02:11:41] one more hit one more hit faster
[02:11:46] they're the [ __ ] believers
[02:11:52] all right throw 12.
[02:11:58] usually Jade Susie
[02:12:10] um what's I want to play in 412 again
[02:12:12] nothing honestly nothing if it was up to
[02:12:14] me I just sweat all that far but if
[02:12:17] we're gonna play something thing to do
[02:12:19] floor 12 for you haha you guys aren't
[02:12:21] allowed to team suggestions because your
[02:12:23] team suggestions are either suck or
[02:12:25] they're not fun and I'm gonna die and
[02:12:26] then it's gonna be annoying so well
[02:12:28] here's what we're gonna do we're gonna
[02:12:29] play [ __ ] oppa shangling and then
[02:12:31] first off we're gonna play either Beto
[02:12:32] or Xiao I probably want to get Beto
[02:12:34] footage just in case but I think we'll
[02:12:35] start with Shao because ciao tell me why
[02:12:38] shangling
[02:12:39] is so op
[02:12:43] foreign
[02:12:58] use Ito use sperm looking MF I okay
[02:13:03] first of all that's not true second of
[02:13:04] all why the [ __ ] would I play Ito
[02:13:08] in this economy
[02:13:10] and first half I guess you could play
[02:13:12] them first off but like why
[02:13:29] Ito can destroy everything true actually
[02:13:39] okay
[02:13:46] it used to be an Ito main no I wasn't
[02:13:49] okay I like Ito We're not gonna do our
[02:13:51] first our first [ __ ] clear this event
[02:13:53] or this rotate this Ito
[02:13:59] we get there after
[02:14:02] I kind of want to use Bennett first half
[02:14:27] yeah what if we played the Luke again
[02:14:31] the intro we could play the Luke again
[02:14:34] true
[02:14:51] we're gonna do a deluke yell on no
[02:14:55] singtra because I want more Hydro
[02:14:56] singtra 20 months holy
[02:14:59] bye Drew
[02:15:05] and then it's a conundrum because you
[02:15:07] add another dendro you're playing
[02:15:08] burning you had another pyro you're
[02:15:09] playing burning you add another Hydro
[02:15:11] you have like one bloom per year but
[02:15:14] that's not even bad because you're
[02:15:15] vaping it's fine so it's probably double
[02:15:17] Hydro but I'm actually down to do like
[02:15:19] but I don't
[02:15:21] what if we do shangling tell me why [ __ ]
[02:15:26] we're probably gonna be procking burning
[02:15:27] though but all good
[02:15:30] this is a burning team
[02:15:33] how are you breaking Shields the Luke
[02:15:34] applies a lot of Pyro
[02:15:36] it's fine with shields
[02:15:41] I think the first thing we did was
[02:15:42] nahida Jonathan no we needed a Healer
[02:15:44] who did we play I don't know I think we
[02:15:46] had like kokomi
[02:15:48] I don't know
[02:15:57] venti for hydro Infuse
[02:16:09] no
[02:16:20] okay let me make sure it looks good
[02:16:25] Central heal enough of your shielded
[02:16:26] okay but by just not at really a
[02:16:28] shielder he just heals he gives you like
[02:16:30] the smallest Shields known to man
[02:16:34] foreign
[02:16:39] flowers
[02:17:06] okay Loki Loki [ __ ] out not the Mastery
[02:17:10] what if we just go what if we just go
[02:17:11] what if I just go wolves
[02:17:13] what if I just go big crit bigger crit
[02:17:15] bigger person
[02:17:20] uh I'll probably just go mailed
[02:17:36] oh
[02:17:42] [ __ ] is this
[02:17:44] wait why'd I have so much crit rate
[02:17:46] where the [ __ ] is the crittery coming
[02:17:47] from I know I have a circuit but
[02:17:53] how do I keep getting more and more good
[02:17:55] rate oh this one 2063 um
[02:18:01] Ascension
[02:18:04] um
[02:18:04] I forgot about that
[02:18:09] tight win
[02:18:10] [ __ ] you shangling we're playing homo
[02:18:13] okay never mind we're playing Jade
[02:18:22] hey you should play Daya no I shouldn't
[02:18:31] oh
[02:18:35] play the original song I don't like the
[02:18:36] original song
[02:18:52] I don't know I can listen to every type
[02:18:54] of music I just can't listen to Pop I
[02:18:56] don't know why it's just like it makes
[02:18:57] me I don't know it like numbs my brain I
[02:19:00] don't have thoughts while listening to
[02:19:01] it and I don't like that because then my
[02:19:03] ADH demons take over
[02:19:06] foreign
[02:19:17] ER surely it's fine because we're triple
[02:19:21] Animo
[02:19:24] the original isn't pop true you got me
[02:19:27] there
[02:19:29] well on 5V
[02:19:50] um
[02:19:51] uh it's fine we'll be okay
[02:19:54] all right we just do this
[02:19:57] foreign
[02:20:25] see you guys are saying [ __ ] I never
[02:20:27] said I never called the artist overrated
[02:20:29] I think the artist has bangers I just
[02:20:31] don't like that one song in that version
[02:20:32] and I think the remix is better suck my
[02:20:35] balls stop drawing conclusions I never
[02:20:37] said
[02:20:39] an average Genji player
[02:20:47] I don't know who my last thought's gonna
[02:20:48] be
[02:21:00] a last slot okay I'm down but I don't
[02:21:04] think we'll Nine Star like I'm actually
[02:21:05] down
[02:21:06] [Music]
[02:21:08] but I don't think we'll Nine Star
[02:21:19] foreign
[02:21:24] [ __ ] it we'll figure it out
[02:21:27] wait but I don't want saxard
[02:21:29] let's just do I don't care whatever
[02:21:32] Lisa for the plaque you mean plot the
[02:21:36] [ __ ] is the plot of I don't even want to
[02:21:38] ask that actually I know the answer all
[02:21:39] right ciao farzan casual Bennett second
[02:21:43] half
[02:21:49] get a twisted Main Event Gambler okay
[02:21:54] why are you guys gambling
[02:21:56] wait okay but I can't guarantee that
[02:21:58] we're gonna actually clear with the Luke
[02:22:01] like I don't this might be a scam
[02:22:07] whatever
[02:22:47] so like
[02:22:49] balls balls I wanna do your lawn
[02:22:53] or like kazua sucrose
[02:22:56] Venti
[02:22:58] but I feel like I shouldn't and I feel
[02:23:00] like I'm gonna die if I do that
[02:23:11] look at the ratio
[02:23:16] dude I've done this Abyss before why are
[02:23:19] 83 percent of people doubters
[02:23:22] I'm not gonna die
[02:23:27] okay maybe I should run strongly first
[02:23:28] off all right maybe maybe I want to be a
[02:23:31] bit more careful
[02:23:47] let me think so
[02:23:50] double hydro's good but we don't really
[02:23:52] need DPS so Elon doesn't actually do
[02:23:55] anything because we don't need damage we
[02:23:56] just need to not die in 12 1 12 2 is a
[02:23:59] [ __ ] joke and then 12 3 is a [ __ ]
[02:24:01] joke
[02:24:02] so we probably just want like
[02:24:05] [ __ ] kokomi or like John Lee
[02:24:13] my Coco is on Full yeah but I don't feel
[02:24:15] like changing it
[02:24:21] and even donated one dollar Hello's eye
[02:24:25] zero X I heard you got a degree in
[02:24:27] Quantum risics
[02:24:29] a glimpse of that Talent
[02:24:36] yeah hear me out cookie we break the
[02:24:38] shield more true
[02:24:46] yeah Electro works well with Hydro
[02:24:48] Electro works well with dendro
[02:24:50] there is no downside unless we overload
[02:24:53] that's not gonna happen
[02:24:57] cocktail team yes that's the point
[02:25:01] I can also play Kirara for her Shields
[02:25:03] because her Shield is actually really
[02:25:04] good and it might be more comfy than
[02:25:06] baiju but then it's not as much dendro
[02:25:08] app
[02:25:23] yeah but no I don't trust myself I think
[02:25:26] I'm gonna die so we're just gonna do
[02:25:27] this
[02:25:28] double healer is pointless have you seen
[02:25:30] 12
[02:25:32] okay we're just gonna go
[02:25:37] um
[02:25:38] we should be good
[02:25:40] I really want to check my Synchro but
[02:25:42] I'm just gonna assume he's geared
[02:25:44] and uh
[02:25:46] um I think we send it
[02:25:59] you can avoid dual healer with Daya yes
[02:26:01] you can also avoid clearing with there
[02:26:05] all right
[02:26:08] rip your points it's kooky geared we'll
[02:26:10] see
[02:26:21] repeat one with wind and Cloud
[02:26:25] are these guys gonna die or no
[02:26:30] I don't mind
[02:26:31] bro let me play the game okay we did
[02:26:34] this this as far as on forever
[02:26:40] you guys you think I'm playing Xiao you

[02:27:56] says as he runs and loses all the
[02:27:57] stamina

[02:28:14] all time

[02:29:36] baiju is absolutely a waste of space in
[02:29:38] that team we need a shielder that's an
[02:29:40] actual shelter we're gonna play Kirara
[02:29:41] and the same exact team watch
[02:29:45] watch the difference quality makes it
[02:29:47] wasn't even damage
[02:29:48] it was just we weren't shielded it was
[02:29:51] my fault for using uh Baidu so we do the
[02:29:53] Luke cincho Kirara
[02:29:56] cookie and it'll work I promise actually
[02:29:58] cook always no
[02:30:00] ciao
[02:30:04] okay this one hundred gifted actually
[02:30:06] I'm not gonna guess anything but like if
[02:30:08] I were a betting man I would bet on this
[02:30:10] one
[02:30:32] wait does my car have enough ER I'm not
[02:30:34] on sack right now
[02:30:40] I'll be fine
[02:30:43] maybe yaoyah would be better but I don't
[02:30:45] think it's fine
[02:30:46] actually no yeah yeah I wouldn't but
[02:30:48] maybe like nahida zhangi would be better
[02:30:49] but then we don't have a Healer
[02:30:52] maybe like Kirara
[02:30:56] could you Kirara nahida without his
[02:30:57] burning
[02:31:02] anyways I believe
[02:31:05] you might have the damage but die Luke
[02:31:07] doesn't no the Luke does trust
[02:31:16] trust watch
[02:31:18] okay first half's gonna be easy
[02:31:36] yeah
[02:31:38] yeah I should have stayed on Kaza for
[02:31:39] these [ __ ] plants never mind they're
[02:31:41] dead
[02:31:48] that was a waste
[02:31:55] where
[02:31:57] are they there they changed the spawn
[02:31:59] just for me
[02:32:02] me
[02:32:10] go

[02:32:20] why did I I thought I was baiju I
[02:32:23] [ __ ] thought I was but
[02:32:26] I thought I ain't no way I thought I was
[02:32:29] by you
[02:32:32] Purge
[02:32:41] rain outlined your face
[02:32:46] okay I'm gonna group them here [ __ ] it
[02:32:49] If I Lose DPS we need to group them
[02:32:55] race to the wicked okay burning but all
[02:33:00] good
[02:33:02] performance
[02:33:09] oh God God forbid I go for a normal
[02:33:12] attack I'm sorry I'm sorry mijoy I'm
[02:33:14] sorry I I clearly made a mistake I
[02:33:16] shouldn't have not tried to normal
[02:33:18] attacks on my normal attacking character
[02:33:19] in a normal attack leyline buff the best
[02:33:21] I'm sorry clearly that was a mistake of
[02:33:23] mine I hadn't considered
[02:33:26] where the [ __ ] is the Luke all thing bro
[02:33:27] where is little bro looking
[02:33:29] that's okay
[02:33:36] dude my shield legit gets
[02:33:38] blasted actually no that's not true
[02:33:40] curious Shield was pretty tanky a wrong
[02:33:42] character
[02:33:50] rotation is questionable
[02:34:08] I don't think we're winning this but oh
[02:34:11] wait we are what will let him cook let
[02:34:15] them cook
[02:34:16] when you let a chef in the kitchen

[02:34:37] okay that was good that was good retro
[02:34:39] version up to now to be fair
[02:34:42] we should have cleared way faster
[02:34:44] because our first half was really good
[02:34:45] so the fact that it took that long is
[02:34:47] this depressing and furthermore
[02:34:50] our grouping kind of sucked but still
[02:34:52] good it's just our dandruff's kind of
[02:34:53] low with only Kirara but it's fine

[02:37:24] feel like he's not doing a lot of damage
[02:37:25] I'm sure he usually does more it's
[02:37:26] probably because it's on sock but it's
[02:37:28] fine

[02:40:55] Believers retroversion to Luke
[02:41:01] and we stay true to what we love and to
[02:41:05] Who We Are
[02:41:09] almost envied it but I didn't
[02:41:12] easy
[02:41:15] yeah we lost the first clear
[02:41:17] uh but I blame baiju not that badge is
[02:41:19] bad but in that instance his shield
[02:41:21] didn't do [ __ ] so it was scorpion
[02:41:24] cool
[02:41:26] easyw yeah we needed to do a Beto clear
[02:41:28] still
[02:41:30] okay let's check the artifacts we got
[02:41:34] oh zox please show me your the Luke
[02:41:37] retro version build oh no problem so our
[02:41:40] deluke is actually currently on uh male
[02:41:42] flowers the event weapon that gives a
[02:41:43] lot of stats honestly a lot of yeah I'm
[02:41:45] a lot of attack uh we have four Cruiser
[02:41:46] which are Flames uh and we are on eight
[02:41:48] nine eight talents now what we have
[02:41:50] equipped is the four trans Ultra Flames
[02:41:52] some crit and yam some crit em
[02:41:55] uh we have Assad's pretty good uh
[02:41:58] created yeah I'm now granted em sounds
[02:41:59] would be better typically but it is what
[02:42:02] it is we don't have a good yam says
[02:42:03] welcome as a witch so it's fine uh
[02:42:05] goblet we have some a bunch of crit on
[02:42:07] it and a crit rate circle with 22 damage
[02:42:09] and 23 yeah and overall pretty pretty uh
[02:42:12] uh uh relatable 77 165 241 am on an
[02:42:15] attack sounds
[02:42:19] what's nice intro geared I think it's
[02:42:21] because sock sword made his damage kind
[02:42:22] of low yeah I mean it's a pretty good
[02:42:23] build but
[02:42:24] I should probably crown him I feel like

[02:42:29] years and he's not crowned it doesn't
[02:42:30] make sense I crowned the alarm before

[02:48:36] [ __ ] clown Fiesta
[02:48:47] look at that new one that's like
[02:48:48] supposedly good
[02:48:51] dude
[02:48:53] it's not even good
[02:49:09] because I was talking as the creators
[02:49:12] are I mean yeah it's like
[02:49:15] I want twitch to have competition
[02:49:17] because they kind of treat us like dog
[02:49:18] [ __ ] and like so I anyone that gets the
[02:49:22] bag and goes there like go ahead but I
[02:49:24] don't like that their poster boy is like
[02:49:26] a [ __ ] you know
[02:49:29] I mean you guys know who it is Pepe love
[02:49:31] so it's like maybe one day
[02:49:36] one with
[02:49:40] with the sword come shadow
[02:49:46] s
[02:49:55] the M calls are better than Korean yes
[02:49:57] usually
[02:50:01] you call no I'm not talking about train
[02:50:03] tell the [ __ ]
[02:50:15] you like Miss Twitter but you didn't
[02:50:16] pull for it yeah there's no there's no
[02:50:17] value to me getting missed Twitter I
[02:50:19] have Jade I have a [ __ ] crit damage
[02:50:21] weapon
[02:50:22] and I have like I have all the swords I
[02:50:24] could ever use and then my ica's on I
[02:50:25] mean so I'm chilling like I don't even
[02:50:26] miss Twitter
[02:50:27] I might get it eventually but like I
[02:50:29] don't need it it's not really I don't
[02:50:31] want to spend like one to two hundred
[02:50:32] dollars
[02:50:46] oh this would be great if I don't give
[02:50:48] me a website as a fraction that's good
[02:50:50] dude the thing is okay
[02:50:52] this is another thing dude YouTube okay
[02:50:55] if YouTube got their [ __ ] together and
[02:50:58] had a separate site for streaming it
[02:51:00] would be so easy dude they just have
[02:51:02] their like live streams hidden in a
[02:51:04] [ __ ] like [ __ ] in like a a cave
[02:51:07] that you can't [ __ ] find and then
[02:51:09] when you're watching a stream it
[02:51:10] recommends you like videos and that's
[02:51:11] like impossible to like actually watch
[02:51:13] streams there but
[02:51:15] the thing is like
[02:51:17] every so their discoverability is dog
[02:51:20] [ __ ] but every feedback that we've given
[02:51:23] to them they've implemented like every
[02:51:25] single one like I don't know how to
[02:51:28] explain this like YouTubers like talk to
[02:51:29] us like me and like a bunch of people
[02:51:32] and like anything we've told them about
[02:51:34] streaming they've like implemented a lot
[02:51:36] of them
[02:51:37] but it's like at the same time but like
[02:51:39] for some reason they just don't have
[02:51:40] their separate [ __ ] like stream [ __ ]
[02:51:41] and it's just like ass like I don't know
[02:51:43] maybe one day
[02:51:47] oh yeah they also removed dislikes at
[02:51:48] one point I forgot about that that was
[02:51:50] not fun I mean I still see them I have
[02:51:52] like the extension like ad dislike thing
[02:51:56] whatever the [ __ ] that's called It's
[02:51:57] Like on my videos I see my dislikes
[02:51:59] right
[02:52:04] YouTube channel is also [ __ ] to moderate
[02:52:06] yeah two or two reasons one okay this is
[02:52:09] actually funny so two reasons one it's
[02:52:11] kind of like a Walmart of people I
[02:52:12] [ __ ] love my YouTube audience I love
[02:52:14] all of my viewers you're all great but
[02:52:16] the thing with YouTube is like you get
[02:52:17] everyone so you really like like here is
[02:52:20] like more like a family not to be
[02:52:22] parasocial but like
[02:52:24] time to go you do live you literally get
[02:52:27] like every type of person and like it's
[02:52:30] also a lot harder to moderate and
[02:52:32] furthermore
[02:52:35] people have like their full names like
[02:52:37] it's like to like sign up with like
[02:52:39] their [ __ ] Facebook so it'll be like
[02:52:41] like like [ __ ] Richard Michael and
[02:52:44] then that'll be their name they'll have
[02:52:45] like a picture of them with their kid
[02:52:47] and they'll be saying like yeah you're
[02:52:49] [ __ ] stupid and then like I'm not
[02:52:50] gonna roast a dude with this kid and his
[02:52:52] full name there like I feel bad like I'm
[02:52:54] not gonna [ __ ] like pull up this
[02:52:56] dude's government like I don't know so
[02:52:58] it's like yeah
[02:53:01] okay
[02:53:05] [Music]
[02:53:12] Don't Blink
[02:53:14] Billy I don't want to like you know I
[02:53:16] don't want someone to like yeah
[02:53:20] why not because dude I you like you
[02:53:23] don't want to ruin someone's life like
[02:53:24] I'm not trying to like if someone's like
[02:53:27] look okay I think it's fair game if
[02:53:29] someone like [ __ ] talks you like
[02:53:31] Anonymous user five on Twitter is like
[02:53:33] yeah you're a [ __ ] idiot and then you
[02:53:35] respond by being like
[02:53:36] like
[02:53:38] you know you respond that's fair but if
[02:53:40] it's someone like
[02:53:42] posting with like they're [ __ ] on
[02:53:44] Facebook live you're not gonna be like I
[02:53:46] don't know I feel like it's like
[02:53:48] I'm not trying to like expose a person's
[02:53:51] like family I don't know it feels weird
[02:54:05] they asked for it yeah but also like
[02:54:14] it depends okay it depends if it's like
[02:54:16] a death threat yeah I mean they deserve
[02:54:18] it but if it's like a normal just like
[02:54:20] someone's being an ass you don't want to
[02:54:22] like [ __ ] send harassment their way
[02:54:24] because of that like you know you could
[02:54:25] just [ __ ] ban them
[02:54:29] whereas if it's like like if I pull up
[02:54:31] my twitch shot right now right and
[02:54:33] someone like let's say [ __ ] let's say
[02:54:34] [ __ ] hakumai 07 is being toxic like
[02:54:38] I'm not [ __ ] roasting like an actual
[02:54:40] person with a family it's like a random
[02:54:42] username
[02:54:43] right
[02:54:47] I think there's levels to it though
[02:54:51] like there's a difference between that
[02:54:52] and like I don't like when people like
[02:54:54] talk a bunch of [ __ ] and then get called
[02:54:56] out and then cry about it if it's like
[02:54:58] fully uh like if it's like a private
[02:55:00] Twitter account and they're like oh like
[02:55:02] it's like they're like literally like
[02:55:03] this Creator is like the worst because
[02:55:04] this is and then you respond me like no
[02:55:06] and then they're like oh now my life is
[02:55:09] ruined it's like dude [ __ ] shut the
[02:55:10] [ __ ] up
[02:55:11] like it depends like there's like levels
[02:55:26] as you wish me
[02:55:44] misleading title you're not getting any
[02:55:46] glorious artifacts we are but it's at
[02:55:47] the end like the longer you farm the
[02:55:49] more you build up good luck there's like
[02:55:51] a good luck pity secretly building in
[02:55:53] your account
[02:56:00] okay
[02:56:09] no I'm not even saying Twitter's more
[02:56:11] toxic I like dude when I YouTube live
[02:56:14] stream there's like a like dude the
[02:56:16] amount because I didn't know you could
[02:56:17] Auto mod so the amount of like
[02:56:20] like the amount of slurs my single mod
[02:56:22] had to delete or like it was like it
[02:56:24] shouldn't have been that high I'm just
[02:56:26] saying the thing is like sometimes I
[02:56:28] feel like people will like publicly like
[02:56:31] publicly [ __ ] on a Creator and like
[02:56:34] death threat after death threat and then
[02:56:35] if they ever respond they'll pull up the
[02:56:37] defense of like hey actually I'm 15 and
[02:56:40] now I have to go private and now my
[02:56:42] light like it's like dude like why are
[02:56:44] you like what are you doing like is this
[02:56:46] the life you want to live dude at third
[02:56:48] at 12 I was diamond in Starcraft at 15 I
[02:56:51] was top 100 in Hearthstone okay clearly
[02:56:53] you can have the maturity or the
[02:56:55] intellect to not [ __ ] send death
[02:56:57] threats and then be mad if they respond
[02:56:58] to you like literally gold [ __ ] like
[02:57:01] I don't know go outside it's not that
[02:57:03] deep
[02:57:04] so I don't know
[02:57:06] like
[02:57:08] I don't know
[02:57:16] uh are there Crystal Flash here give me
[02:57:19] give me
[02:57:27] let's get engaged
[02:57:34] is QR Shield good yes it's usually the
[02:57:36] best four-star Shield very very strong
[02:57:38] and uh good yeah like I like herara
[02:57:43] she's not like the most underrop but for
[02:57:44] like Quicken is enough and then her
[02:57:45] Shield's really good I actually like her
[02:57:46] Shield a lot for this Abyss it made me
[02:57:47] like her more because for this event
[02:57:49] it's like you're getting you're
[02:57:50] literally getting ass blasted by three
[02:57:52] enemies at the same time so having a
[02:57:54] good Shield helps
[02:58:01] what is this song
[02:58:03] it's called losing my mind
[02:58:07] your kirara's Shield breaks up to three
[02:58:09] seconds of the Vermilion domain okay

[03:01:49] that everyone sucks yeah they're playing

[03:01:52] I don't like that you have to have
[03:01:54] confidence even you have to play with
[03:01:55] fake confidence until you get until you
[03:01:57] start playing with real confidence
[03:01:59] Spike planted yeah this is like silver

[03:32:18] access to her let's not talk about it
[03:32:20] festering desire R2 because I was too

[03:32:23] old account

[03:32:29] Ling constellations no but I think I
[03:32:31] have Beto constellations yeah we have
[03:32:33] beta C3
[03:32:35] um
[03:32:36] so I actually like I want to get this
[03:32:39] account Abyss ready so we can like
[03:32:40] experience it from a different POV you
[03:32:42] know
[03:32:45] it is the old account it is like a one
[03:32:47] point it is the first I re-rolled okay
[03:32:48] this is the lore I reroll this account
[03:32:51] during my Obligations law class
[03:32:54] on mobile until I wanted Razer because
[03:32:56] Albedo Banner the first one I think
[03:32:59] maybe the second I don't know but I
[03:33:00] remember Razer was on it
[03:33:03] no I must have been the first
[03:33:05] yeah first and Razer was on the banner
[03:33:07] and I wanted to be a Razer player I want
[03:33:09] a Razer so I kept pulling till I got
[03:33:11] razor uh I ended up like never getting
[03:33:13] Razer though or maybe official was on
[03:33:15] the bed I want to fit I don't know I
[03:33:16] wanna I
[03:33:17] either but I also wanted official and
[03:33:19] then I ended up rerling to like I got
[03:33:21] harp and Mona that was my reroll at
[03:33:23] heart Mona and then I wanted Razer
[03:33:25] uh and the lore behind this bio here is
[03:33:29] I didn't want to spend but then I got
[03:33:30] Monon Razer uh Monon harp and then the
[03:33:32] banner was gonna leave and I said I need
[03:33:33] Razer so I bought the [ __ ] welkin
[03:33:35] just for the [ __ ] Crystal things then
[03:33:37] I got Razer and then I stopped vlogging
[03:33:39] in so I only claimed like [ __ ] like
[03:33:40] five days or some [ __ ] like maybe ten
[03:33:42] and then I stopped playing
[03:33:45] so that's the lore
[03:33:48] that is the Lord
[03:33:53] yeah minus five dollars all good though
[03:33:57] um
[03:33:58] but I actually played razors he's level
[03:33:59] six out of 70. I'm [ __ ] 80 prototype
[03:34:01] archaic two blood stain to Berserker
[03:34:03] check the ratio
[03:34:05] not bad not bad you love no
[03:34:09] um but our showers like our shadow okay
[03:34:11] listen
[03:34:11] our showers unironically for AR 44
[03:34:15] really good progress we are AR 44 black
[03:34:18] lift Pole look at this
[03:34:21] oh
[03:34:24] how is this possible
[03:34:27] now it rolled HP twice but it's still
[03:34:29] really good
[03:34:30] all right really good
[03:34:33] not mid we're AR 40 [ __ ] six this one
[03:34:36] also really good donated 1.10 hi Mr
[03:34:41] socks those are gonna be quiet and
[03:34:43] normal for this Vermilion flower that
[03:34:46] would make that would make
[03:34:48] other cells drool
[03:34:51] now the only thing is this means I'm I'm
[03:34:53] forced to farm another villain piece but
[03:34:55] it's fine surely Vermillion on my Asia
[03:34:57] account isn't a bad idea
[03:34:59] um so it's like a good start
[03:35:00] but we still have a lot of work to do
[03:35:02] you know
[03:35:06] we already have three good pieces so all
[03:35:08] we need is like like dude like look at
[03:35:09] this is a four-star color but eventually
[03:35:10] we got like a good one right so yeah
[03:35:14] I guess attack goblet is fine too but
[03:35:16] we'll see
[03:35:17] better than any account no it's not and
[03:35:20] then our black move pool is level 80 we
[03:35:22] need to level it
[03:35:23] uh honestly I might just use dragon's
[03:35:25] been on shangling because I don't want
[03:35:26] to farm the catch
[03:35:30] let's look at everything we have
[03:35:32] we have
[03:35:34] how about make this into a YouTube video
[03:35:35] I don't know but we have like a second
[03:35:37] account
[03:35:38] we have black glove pool
[03:35:40] Skyward harp which I reload for
[03:35:43] oh you know festering desire
[03:35:46] I'll come five weapons we got a five bow
[03:35:47] for our far oh yeah oh one [ __ ] I
[03:35:50] started I logged back into this account
[03:35:52] when wander Banner was here and I pulled
[03:35:54] to get a c zero farazon so we're gonna
[03:35:57] need like at least 300 energy recharge
[03:35:59] but it's gonna be fun so we're gonna
[03:36:00] place the zero fars on it's gonna be
[03:36:02] great I [ __ ] can't wait
[03:36:04] huh
[03:36:06] uh we have a Hazel actually that's
[03:36:08] pretty cool

[03:36:30] and um
[03:36:32] yeah I have Albedo so I think the teams
[03:36:34] are gonna play we'll probably have like
[03:36:36] this team
[03:36:40] like okay
[03:36:42] what is the goal of this account thanks
[03:36:44] for asking chatter probably we're gonna
[03:36:46] try to get it ready by fonten because
[03:36:48] the business keep getting harder and
[03:36:49] more annoying so I kind of want to
[03:36:50] experience it on like a you know not
[03:36:52] just like a low budget like low
[03:36:54] investment like low level free to play
[03:36:57] like account that we like never touch
[03:36:58] kind of thing right but also on 275 ping

[03:37:09] so I think it'll be funny uh now with
[03:37:12] that in mind
[03:37:13] I think
[03:37:15] plus one I think the teams we should be
[03:37:18] gearing towards are a Xiao team Xiao
[03:37:21] with a c0 farzan and sucrose and then
[03:37:24] ideally Ben it and then our second team
[03:37:26] if we have better free we could do
[03:37:27] National you know Bennett changling open
[03:37:30] this open that nobody wants to see
[03:37:32] shangling so while we could do that I
[03:37:35] might just play a dendro team instead
[03:37:36] maybe kaching with Fishel and then
[03:37:39] dendro main character and then a flex
[03:37:41] slot at the end ID like a Healer uh we
[03:37:44] could
[03:37:45] oh no you want uh Nemo sorry the last
[03:37:47] one is an email you probably want like
[03:37:49] well we don't have a Healer oh we get
[03:37:51] saw you
[03:37:53] you
[03:37:59] if we get you gray then we could get yao
[03:38:02] yao sucrose
[03:38:06] official kitchen
[03:38:09] but I don't want to get any of these
[03:38:11] five stars I know they're both broken
[03:38:12] but I would much rather wait for
[03:38:14] Fountain characters on this account
[03:38:15] because Cosmo's broken but like dude who
[03:38:18] the [ __ ] is like who the [ __ ] cares if I
[03:38:20] can clear on a [ __ ] 270 ping like
[03:38:24] who who cares if I can clear on this
[03:38:26] account if I have Cosmo I remember oh
[03:38:27] you just carried the cause of it like No
[03:38:29] One's Gonna care so I don't want kazua
[03:38:32] he just makes the game easy
[03:38:40] me I care
[03:38:48] but the only problem is if my Shao team
[03:38:51] has farzan then I need another anymore
[03:38:53] which is probably gonna be sucrose if
[03:38:55] that is the case then my second team of
[03:38:57] kecking and Fishel and yeah yeah let's
[03:39:00] say needs an animal character as well
[03:39:01] and I won't have one unless I play
[03:39:03] [ __ ] Animo MC
[03:39:08] oh
[03:39:16] play Barbara for a quick Bloom okay I I
[03:39:20] mean yeah you can
[03:39:24] wait that was the plan actually I think
[03:39:26] that was the plan I actually think that
[03:39:27] was my plan
[03:39:29] look if I open team setup I think you'll
[03:39:30] see that team yeah literally that was
[03:39:32] actually what I was gonna do I remember
[03:39:34] I had kitchen official Dedra MC and then
[03:39:37] Barbara that was actually what I was
[03:39:38] gonna do but dude I don't want to do
[03:39:40] that like I know it's not bad it's
[03:39:43] actually not bad but like
[03:39:45] I'd rather play yeah yeah like sucrose
[03:39:50] wait this is funny though it's Barbara
[03:39:52] it would actually be funny maybe we
[03:39:54] should
[03:39:55] maybe we should
[03:40:04] song name afterlife
[03:40:10] so that is our plan with this account
[03:40:13] uh and I think it'll be good content
[03:40:15] because artifact grinding is content
[03:40:17] strong boxes content just literally
[03:40:19] progressing through this [ __ ] Baron
[03:40:22] of a game is content and I don't even
[03:40:24] have Inazuma unlocked and then Abyss
[03:40:27] every new Abyss is gonna be like actual
[03:40:29] [ __ ] ass like this is yeah it's gonna
[03:40:32] be the bane of my existence
[03:40:36] and then eventually I'll do um
[03:40:41] eventually I'll
[03:40:43] yeah
[03:40:45] yeah we'll see
[03:40:53] yeah it's gonna be 275 pink Abyss
[03:40:57] do a temple chat we are free to play we
[03:41:00] cannot succumb to temptation
[03:41:17] this batter's nah dude dude no I can't
[03:41:20] wait what is my pity let's look let's
[03:41:21] look
[03:41:24] oh yeah see I literally just got fars on
[03:41:25] I got farzan then I dipped [ __ ]
[03:41:27] December
[03:41:34] 5 codex
[03:41:36] okay that's all that's all we know
[03:41:57] it's causal yeah but I don't know if I
[03:41:59] even want cosm on this account like
[03:42:01] obviously he's good but I don't know if
[03:42:03] it ruins the experience
[03:42:30] what the [ __ ] is he doing I'm far oh
[03:42:33] yeah you guys want to know why my
[03:42:34] characters aren't leveled take a guess
[03:42:36] take it I want to see who's the first
[03:42:38] person to Guess Who why my characters
[03:42:39] aren't leveled
[03:42:45] broke no dude listen we have XP books we
[03:42:48] have Mora
[03:42:50] oh Laura
[03:42:52] but you know what I don't have
[03:42:55] flowers or [ __ ] boss like enemy mats
[03:42:58] like I don't even fight like I don't
[03:43:01] remember the last time I explored on
[03:43:03] this account so I don't have anything
[03:43:05] like if I look at my [ __ ] Bennett I
[03:43:07] actually can't so it's like we're kind
[03:43:10] of [ __ ] stuck
[03:43:12] um
[03:43:14] yeah
[03:43:18] wait why do I have so many lighting
[03:43:19] prisms oh I wanted to level yeah we just
[03:43:22] pulled her I think
[03:43:23] wait what [ __ ] weapon I'm gonna use
[03:43:25] on her oh my God I guess Iron's thing
[03:43:27] but
[03:43:29] yeah or Harbinger but we don't have a
[03:43:31] shielders they're probably iron sting
[03:43:33] um
[03:43:34] I mean everything's fine
[03:43:36] St thing is fine
[03:43:42] wait does Michael Ching have core lapis
[03:43:45] what's up
[03:43:47] okay that's why she's not ascended
[03:43:53] yeah I couldn't do the umbrella event
[03:43:55] because you needed Inazuma unlocked you
[03:43:57] needed to start it Inazuma Quest so I
[03:43:59] couldn't do it
[03:44:01] gives energy recharge I'm gonna craft it
[03:44:03] for Bennett but not for catching
[03:44:06] is this your account yeah
[03:44:23] well I don't have snow tuned
[03:44:26] um well I guess I have our kick
[03:44:28] when I had this weapon it was called
[03:44:29] prototype aminus true actually true
[03:44:32] well I feel saying 300 BC builds what
[03:44:36] does that even mean
[03:44:38] what does that even mean what does that
[03:44:40] mean what does that mean
[03:44:47] oh this is good wait we actually have
[03:44:49] this sheesh look at this
[03:45:00] so yeah I think that's the what we're
[03:45:02] gonna do on this account
[03:45:04] um with that said there's like 20
[03:45:06] minutes till the day reset let me auto
[03:45:07] battle in Star rail so I don't
[03:45:09] not spend my stamina
[03:45:11] I'll show you guys the relics I get if
[03:45:13] they're good
[03:45:22] miss the free Farms on yeah but c0
[03:45:24] farazone's definitely the experience
[03:45:26] we're going for
[03:45:37] okay so there's two ways we could do
[03:45:39] this account I think we could be like
[03:45:40] hey look at my freedom account or
[03:45:42] technically like 2.5 but
[03:45:45] I'll say free to play account doing well
[03:45:47] right on 270 ping wow look at my dendro
[03:45:49] kitchen team and my shangling but an
[03:45:51] alternative is we could just do a
[03:45:53] struggle simulator and play Eula in this
[03:45:55] abyss and Eula in the recent abysses has
[03:45:58] not been fun
[03:46:06] thank you
[03:46:21] I do really want yayao
[03:46:27] foreign
[03:46:32] possessed you to get Eula it was her
[03:46:34] first banner and I was playing a razor
[03:46:36] and my whole chat was like get you like
[03:46:38] get you loud I was like sure little did
[03:46:40] I know
[03:46:41] I could have been playing thundering
[03:46:43] furry instead of Eula but hey
[03:46:50] to be fair Al hyphen would be pretty
[03:46:52] good too because we have a spare sync
[03:46:54] show a spare I think we have cookie but
[03:46:57] if not we could just use like Beto and
[03:46:59] like well I guess we need cause with a
[03:47:01] hyperboom but we could put like do I
[03:47:03] have cookie wait
[03:47:06] I don't have cookie I mean I guess we
[03:47:07] could just like some facial [ __ ] but
[03:47:09] yeah or like a quick dude we like
[03:47:11] official Beto
[03:47:23] well I kind of want to wait for hot dad
[03:47:25] [Music]
[03:47:32] watch out what the main should I found
[03:47:34] on this guy okay surely I don't surely I
[03:47:36] don't surely I don't go to Vermillion on
[03:47:38] a second account sure that'll go for a
[03:47:41] million on an account that can't use
[03:47:42] Echoes because above 100 ping it gets
[03:47:45] worse and it doesn't brought correctly
[03:47:48] my voice didn't crack the mic just
[03:47:51] peaked
[03:47:59] okay we'll do one
[03:48:01] one because if you think about it I need
[03:48:04] thundering Fury and I need Vermillion
[03:48:06] but you can't strongbox Vermillion you
[03:48:08] can strongbox thundering Fury so
[03:48:09] technically this is optimal true
[03:48:11] true
[03:48:13] also we need deepwood and gilded true
[03:48:19] you guys see the pink can you guys feel
[03:48:21] the delay is it just me
[03:48:25] I think it's just me
[03:48:30] motorcycle
[03:48:35] relatable ping finally
[03:48:38] this 270 relatable thumb massage
[03:48:50] why no shelter because we don't need it
[03:48:52] I'm a master of dodging
[03:49:01] did you miss the event with free audio
[03:49:03] oh
[03:49:04] here wait what that was that I don't
[03:49:06] remember that what the [ __ ] do we oh the
[03:49:09] like pick a leeway character true yeah I
[03:49:11] didn't do that
[03:49:12] also at the time I ended up seeing
[03:49:14] Charles I probably would have picked
[03:49:15] intro
[03:49:17] wait maybe I didn't think Joe I don't
[03:49:19] know
[03:49:29] can you die cool
[03:49:32] Dragon this device
[03:49:35] I don't know but watch this
[03:49:38] 270 ping per million watch this
[03:49:42] oh
[03:49:46] we can use four stars on this account so
[03:49:48] it's fine we could get like um
[03:49:52] [Applause]

[03:54:13] pretty cool
[03:54:24] then I'm actually carrying I'm actually
[03:54:26] carrying
[03:54:31] 18K we're carrying
[03:54:36] 10.9 K we're actually kidding
[03:54:46] pig isn't related to dodging okay stop
[03:54:48] [ __ ] saying that I know it's
[03:54:50] client-side but when you have ping the
[03:54:52] [ __ ] action you take and the visuals
[03:54:54] and everything is like off-centered and
[03:54:55] it feels [ __ ] [ __ ] to like see a
[03:54:57] thing come at you and you're used to
[03:54:58] Reaction Time dodging but then when you
[03:55:00] press it doesn't Dodge because you like
[03:55:02] I don't know I don't know how to explain
[03:55:03] it everything just feels [ __ ]
[03:55:08] like I know dodging his client side and
[03:55:10] it's not technically pink but I still
[03:55:12] feel like it's [ __ ] every time also
[03:55:15] got over a million piece this could be
[03:55:17] good
[03:55:23] because I'm pretty sure like yeah
[03:55:32] that's what it feels like to live in
[03:55:34] Australia did you try to flip my webcam
[03:55:36] upside down we'll do Australia POV
[03:55:39] zionics clears Vermillion in Australia
[03:55:56] how about you turn off your face cam why
[03:55:59] would I do that literally why would I do
[03:56:01] that
[03:56:15] how would I even play this account what
[03:56:17] would my free to play Adventures look
[03:56:18] like okay I resin but I have to clear
[03:56:21] the whole [ __ ] game would have to go
[03:56:23] exploring again until we get to the
[03:56:25] abyss do all the [ __ ] what do you
[03:56:27] guys even would you guys watch me do
[03:56:28] quests again there's no way
[03:56:31] no way you would watch me Speed Run
[03:56:33] Quest again
[03:56:40] yeah it's like visually dodging is can
[03:56:42] be [ __ ] piping
[03:56:45] yep
[03:56:48] no skip this time what do you mean all
[03:56:51] right it's probably my last song I'm
[03:56:52] Gonna Cut this after
[03:56:56] oh yeah I guess I didn't stream my
[03:56:58] quests
[03:57:07] maybe you're doing 3.8 we do catch up
[03:57:09] catch up before fountain
[03:57:21] sorry
[03:57:25] here
[03:57:31] stream sniper is not fine with
[03:57:33] Vermillion I would rather be people from
[03:57:34] the stream than innocent innocent like
[03:57:37] bystanders Farm Vermilion I I would hope
[03:57:40] that Asia server as a collective is
[03:57:42] smart enough to not have many people
[03:57:44] farming Vermillion so that uh uh I don't
[03:57:47] witness uh Collective waste of resin
[03:57:51] worthless
[03:57:55] and hey frogs we don't care we see Xiao
[03:57:57] Xiao pretty we and [ __ ] waste our
[03:57:59] residents willingly I'm hoping maybe
[03:58:01] other servers are a bit smarter I don't
[03:58:04] know maybe not maybe we're all the same
[03:58:07] maybe we're all de-gens
[03:58:09] okay this [ __ ] sucked
[03:58:11] well maybe a good four star
[03:58:14] okay well I just wasted resin
[03:58:16] let me check my star rail 4 stars five
[03:58:19] stars
[03:58:22] yeah well
[03:58:25] minus 80.
[03:58:32] artifact standards are like really low
[03:58:34] on this count we just want good main
[03:58:35] stats but even with that these have been
[03:58:37] [ __ ]
[03:58:42] my thank you didn't go through
[03:58:51] all right let me auto bottle again
[03:58:55] okay
[03:59:12] highly dangerous okay
[03:59:15] I have to figure out what I want to do
[03:59:16] in this account
[03:59:18] because I want to get to Abyss but I
[03:59:19] don't know if it's worth streaming me
[03:59:21] exploring all of this then doing all of
[03:59:24] the quests then doing all of this and
[03:59:26] then all of uh I think in a dragon's
[03:59:28] fine no I didn't yeah all of this too
[03:59:39] maybe
[03:59:40] two percent
[03:59:44] yeah
[03:59:46] soon
[03:59:48] people watch you Auto Battle true
[03:59:50] actually
[03:59:52] that's actually a good point
[04:00:03] do aronara again oh God
[04:00:06] at least the RNR requests like our
[04:00:08] request was good but I actually like
[04:00:09] listened to it so I wouldn't want to
[04:00:10] like listen to it again
[04:00:17] huh
[04:00:26] our Quest was brutal yeah the forest
[04:00:29] remembers but it was good
[04:00:36] it was probably the best world or one of
[04:00:37] the best world quests it's just I kind
[04:00:39] of sagged I wasn't voiced I feel like a
[04:00:41] lot of the world quests are like some of
[04:00:43] them are really good but they're not
[04:00:43] voice acted and like all the times I
[04:00:45] [ __ ] can't be asked
[04:00:47] like a lot of them I just Spam spacebar
[04:00:49] r r is actually kind of red though like
[04:00:51] some parts of it I was like I don't care
[04:00:52] but most of it I read
[04:00:57] I could voice act every R&R true real
[04:01:16] where the [ __ ] the moro it took a year
[04:01:24] good but my God is too much it is a lot
[04:01:27] but it was good
[04:01:30] [ __ ] love on ours
[04:01:32] I still don't I still haven't found all
[04:01:34] of them in a while though [ __ ] that
[04:01:37] wait that's [ __ ] precious chest
[04:01:44] yep so I think I'll probably I'll
[04:01:46] probably make dedicated videos on this
[04:01:48] account but they're not like like
[04:01:49] dedicated streams rather but I have to
[04:01:51] figure it out
[04:01:52] let me go pronounce resin [ __ ] that
[04:01:54] chest I don't care I'm never claiming
[04:01:55] that chest in my life
[04:02:09] wait what should our first video of this
[04:02:11] account be then
[04:02:17] all right
[04:02:18] yeah
[04:02:21] wasting my free to play accounts resin
[04:02:24] in Vermilion again
[04:02:28] oh floor 11.
[04:02:37] I'm actually down wait how many froggles
[04:02:39] do I have
[04:02:40] oh
[04:02:43] I have 74 fragiles
[04:02:49] guys if you know anything about me
[04:02:57] we spend some problems let's say 10 20.
[04:03:00] in Vermillion gear our Xiao then spend
[04:03:04] the artifacts we get on thundering Fury
[04:03:07] in the strong box then spend some others
[04:03:10] on deepwood and gilded than the rest on
[04:03:12] leveling characters
[04:03:15] reduced
[04:03:21] to just
[04:03:23] I am down to do deepwood and Guild
[04:03:25] Donuts account though but then what's
[04:03:27] the title like how do I make that into a
[04:03:28] video there's no title there is no title
[04:03:30] there
[04:03:32] xyox is responsible that's not a [ __ ]
[04:03:35] title
[04:03:51] I'm not creating new accounts
[04:04:18] preparing free-to-play God for fountain
[04:04:26] I mean to be fair
[04:04:28] I could start the video with like okay
[04:04:30] it could be called him out it's called
[04:04:32] okay it's called I like it's like
[04:04:34] whatever like
[04:04:36] he's doing like wasting my resident
[04:04:38] Vermillion for a second time right and
[04:04:40] then that's gonna be like the first part
[04:04:41] of the video and then after that it's
[04:04:42] like 10 fragiles then after that we
[04:04:44] become efficient and then we do deepwood
[04:04:46] and then we're smart and we explore true
[04:04:47] true and then like the title's true but
[04:04:50] it's only like half true okay true
[04:04:59] thank you
[04:05:03] that is minus 40. I'm sorry
[04:05:08] the refs
[04:05:20] all right any other content okay what
[04:05:23] wait what if what if before I ended my
[04:05:24] first stream I got you way can you
[04:05:26] imagine what about you guys boom I kind
[04:05:28] of don't want coso I know he's broken
[04:05:29] but like he makes the game like
[04:05:31] easy no
[04:05:34] I mean I guess I'm down to get him
[04:05:38] I only okay I want to save my Primos and
[04:05:41] I only want you gray so
[04:05:43] pretend I didn't do this because I
[04:05:45] shouldn't but also I haven't been able I
[04:05:48] haven't been able to get any of the
[04:05:49] Stardust things because I don't have I
[04:05:51] don't pull so technically this is
[04:05:53] efficient true true so we get eugway
[04:05:58] and then it's efficient
[04:06:01] five star would be cool but ideally four
[04:06:02] okay cool I mean I guess five would be
[04:06:04] better but whatever
[04:06:07] okay
[04:06:08] freeze
[04:06:10] while I hear Co-op sounds in the

[04:09:20] balls
[04:09:21] OS
[04:09:25] rip minus three kayas
[04:09:28] hi guys I think that's the plan then
[04:09:30] uh it's [ __ ] 5am so I should go to
[04:09:32] bed because I've been dude I almost
[04:09:34] didn't I was really tired I don't know
[04:09:35] how I I stayed relatively high energy up
[04:09:38] until now but thanks for watching I
[04:09:39] appreciate you guys tomorrow I'm gonna
[04:09:40] upload my hyphen video or I'll try to so
[04:09:43] should you pull it should have been out
[04:09:44] earlier but it is what it is and then
[04:09:46] unironically here's the plan okay here's
[04:09:48] the plan listen not listen up
[04:09:49] I want to do a stereo stream I want to
[04:09:51] do a Gantry stream so I'm gonna do one
[04:09:53] of the two or both
[04:09:55] in two days I think tomorrow I'll work
[04:09:57] on videos if I can't stream I will but
[04:09:58] ideally I think I'm just gonna Focus
[04:09:59] videos my brother's visiting too then in
[04:10:01] two days either genjen or Star rail or
[04:10:03] both
[04:10:04] and on the 19th I think I'm gonna be
[04:10:07] playing Final Fantasy 16 so I might do
[04:10:09] like gentian and then try Final Fantasy
[04:10:10] and I'm probably gonna do two streams of
[04:10:11] them I think
[04:10:13] not decided yet but yeah so expect that
[04:10:15] variety content get your content start
[04:10:17] about content
[04:10:20] um and uh yeah hope you guys enjoyed the
[04:10:23] content also I have a dad hung guide
[04:10:25] fully edited but I don't know if I want
[04:10:26] to upload it so I guess I should just
[04:10:27] send it but I also recorded it when I
[04:10:30] started recording it my dad hung was
[04:10:31] level 50. and now he's level like 80. so
[04:10:33] it kind of looks weird whereas some
[04:10:35] clips I'm like level 70 and others like
[04:10:36] I'm 50.
[04:10:42] anyways thanks for watching guys I
[04:10:43] [ __ ] love you all but uh I have a lot
[04:10:46] of things to talk about a lot of things
[04:10:46] planned but I can't really do that now
[04:10:48] because I'm tired so we'll talk about
[04:10:49] that soon
[04:10:51] um and I want to try this Asian account
[04:10:52] if you guys want to watch it I might I
[04:10:55] don't know I always say I will and I
[04:10:56] never do but I'm actually down to
[04:10:57] because the the this this looks so
[04:11:00] [ __ ] stupid and unfun that I think
[04:11:02] it'll be fun to try it on a like bad
[04:11:04] account I think it'll be like good
[04:11:05] content so I kind of want to try it
[04:11:09] um
[04:11:11] so the only problem is if we do that
[04:11:14] we're gonna have to do a lot of
[04:11:15] exploration I'm gonna have to play it
[04:11:16] off stream but I'm also gonna do a lot
[04:11:18] of expiration streams they're gonna have
[04:11:19] to [ __ ] explore all this do some
[04:11:20] quests grind our AR grind our [ __ ]
[04:11:23] resin all that [ __ ]
[04:11:25] so if you guys are are down we might do
[04:11:28] a lot more streams so we'll see maybe
[04:11:30] when there's drops maybe like maybe in
[04:11:32] the downtime actually in between waiting
[04:11:33] for [ __ ] 4.0 but
[04:11:36] all right thanks for being here guys I
[04:11:38] love you all uh if you didn't see
[04:11:39] there's a new second Channel video

[04:11:42] you want
[04:11:43] and there's a new Cosmo should you pull
[04:11:44] on the main Channel

[04:11:48] don't know I have to see if the last
[04:11:49] one's up to date or not but I think that
[04:11:51] like it might be more of like a stop
[04:11:53] underrating her video I don't know dude
[04:11:55] I feel like I've talked about Beto a lot
[04:11:56] but people still don't [ __ ] player
[04:11:58] and she's still good that it tilts me
[04:11:59] wait my last guide was a year ago okay
[04:12:01] it's definitely not updated okay then

[04:12:41] aware Beto got a lot why do I sound like
