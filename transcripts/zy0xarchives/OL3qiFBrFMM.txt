[00:11:22] wait uh attack scaling Electro bow Sarah
[00:11:25] all right easy daily quote fundamentally
[00:11:28] speaking of what it is Stow un ready PE
[00:11:30] lavishly praise only upon the former
[00:11:32] fake can truly be arbitrary what the
[00:11:34] [ __ ] who is
[00:11:38] yapping people lavishly praise only the
[00:11:41] former be it snow and and not rain being
[00:11:44] the
[00:11:46] latter
[00:11:49] fate fate lays upon
[00:11:53] you lay forth who's wait I feel like I
[00:11:56] know who this is oh maybe it's like a
[00:11:58] chemist
[00:12:01] maybe cryo like who's who's no Hydro who
[00:12:05] Reigns Ayo Q Kam art
[00:12:15] sooi from a cuz when nlet cries it rains
[00:12:20] fundamentally speaking there's little
[00:12:22] difference between snow and rain people
[00:12:25] lavish praise only upon the
[00:12:27] former fate can be truly arbitrary no
[00:12:30] his voice is too
[00:12:32] like no it's not wait who the [ __ ] is
[00:12:35] this fundamentally
[00:12:37] speaking wait what the [ __ ] wait I play
[00:12:39] this character fundamentally speaking
[00:12:42] well I know this guy fundamentally
[00:12:43] speaking there's little difference
[00:12:45] between snow and
[00:12:54] rain what what dude who is this what the
[00:12:58] [ __ ] wait
[00:13:01] I know okay I know Shia's a Voice sign
[00:13:03] that's like if the snow is thick enough
[00:13:04] we can eat it so I know he yaps about
[00:13:06] snow but the so here's the thing why it
[00:13:09] can't be Shia in my opinion
[00:13:11] Japanese that's not [ __ ] the the dude
[00:13:14] that's not the dude and then English
[00:13:16] fundamentally speaking there's the first
[00:13:18] part sounds like it but then it's a bit
[00:13:19] deeper yet people lavish praise only
[00:13:22] upon the former like that when he said
[00:13:24] former that was not uh the English VF
[00:13:27] Shia I don't know maybe I'm wrong wait
[00:13:29] who
[00:13:30] the who is
[00:13:34] this I might be cooked I have my chat
[00:13:36] closed for the record my chat's right
[00:13:38] here oh [ __ ] I'm
[00:13:45] cooked who are you I know
[00:13:50] you I've heard your voice in my ears
[00:13:53] there's little difference
[00:13:56] between this is sumaru f fundamentally
[00:14:00] speaking fundamentally speaking is that
[00:14:03] sign it's someone I play it might be
[00:14:05] sign fundamentally speaking there's
[00:14:07] little difference between snow and no it
[00:14:09] might be sh who the [ __ ] are you
[00:14:11] fundamentally speaking oh my God
[00:14:13] fundamentally
[00:14:14] speaking it can't
[00:14:17] be okay so I've never played Japanese
[00:14:19] Soo in my life I don't know cuz I've
[00:14:21] only played I have no clue who it is
[00:14:24] like who the Japanese uh like what he
[00:14:25] sounds
[00:14:27] like fundamentally speaking
[00:14:30] fundamentally speaking [ __ ] bro that
[00:14:32] first part sounds like speaking there's
[00:14:34] little difference between the first part
[00:14:35] sounds like sh and then it stops people
[00:14:37] lavish praise only upon the
[00:14:39] former fate can be truly arbitrary oh
[00:14:43] could it be Wanderer fundamentally
[00:14:45] speaking wait isn't wander just baby
[00:14:49] sh Wait this might be
[00:14:55] wander fundamentally speaking you should
[00:14:57] kill okay wait is actually be W I think
[00:15:00] it oh I'm so good okay holy [ __ ] okay my
[00:15:04] life just flashed before my eyes I'm
[00:15:06] okay my Chia won't load dude if I missed
[00:15:08] Chia I was so scared dude if I missed
[00:15:10] Chia I would have [ __ ] I would have
[00:15:12] had to retire cuz dude it sounds yeah
[00:15:15] okay I knew it was like an edgy anemo
[00:15:16] teen so I was like well chia's not a
[00:15:18] teen but I was like this sounds like
[00:15:21] almost Chia but not quite and
[00:15:23] then there's little difference between
[00:15:26] snow and rain yet people laugh also a
[00:15:29] snow voice line that's why don't be like
[00:15:31] that was terrible Shia literally says if
[00:15:32] the snow is thick enough I'll eat it if
[00:15:35] the snow is yellow it's flavorful try it
[00:15:38] he says that he says that not me Shia
[00:15:39] says that fundamentally speaking there's
[00:15:43] little difference between snow and rain
[00:15:45] yet people lavish praise only upon the
[00:15:48] former fate can be truly arbitrary okay
[00:15:51] well I got it

[00:39:07] hell is C1 good it's it's not bad it's
[00:39:10] like 20 is% DPS increase it's so her C1

[00:39:17] more Dent drop right cuz
[00:39:20] the yeah cuz more sense and then C2 is

[00:44:01] you're not building like for burning
[00:44:03] you're just trying to burn like burn
[00:44:05] makes her do more damage but burning is
[00:44:07] still a [ __ ] you kind of like how how
[00:44:10] Navia is good but it's not like she made
[00:44:13] Gio
[00:44:15] good Emily's good it's not like she's
[00:44:17] like making the reaction good she just
[00:44:18] makes burning teams good but it's not
[00:44:21] because of burning it's because of she's
[00:44:22] pretty
[00:44:23] good uh was going to craft order
[00:44:29] order order YULA please you've never let

[00:44:56] she's not out two no one was saying
[00:44:58] she's ass even before she came out so
[00:45:00] your information literally comes from
[00:45:02] yourself looking at her and being like
[00:45:03] she no one said she's ass she's not out
[00:45:06] so it's not like like you have no
[00:45:18] basis uh I kind only do nine set
[00:45:20] honestly N9 88 is fine I usually test at
[00:45:24] 88 well I usually test at
[00:45:25] 9 I'll just do
[00:45:33] it okay but also not to be that guy but
[00:45:37] I'm going to be that guy Neu came out
[00:45:40] but okay I'm going to say before sumaru
[00:45:41] because anything before Nita wasn't
[00:45:44] sumaru [ __ ] you don't ask questions nilu
[00:45:46] came out before sumaru and then got
[00:45:47] expedit expeditiously better that's not
[00:45:49] the word I was looking for exponentially
[00:45:51] better uh even though she was good with
[00:45:52] the Basse you know like you can play her
[00:45:53] like DMC COA but it did get better uh
[00:45:56] and then baiju came out before sumaru
[00:45:58] got better uh sorry before yeah got
[00:46:01] before font sorry sorry got better
[00:46:04] [ __ ] I assume Emily will work with uh
[00:46:06] nline characters I mean maybe not but
[00:46:14] probably so I highly um I'm not trying
[00:46:17] to like oversell her because quite
[00:46:19] frankly you don't need her like you know
[00:46:22] but I I do think she would like there's
[00:46:24] a chance she gets better Co
[00:46:28] anyways
[00:46:31] um what was I doing I think we're just
[00:46:33] ready to play
[00:46:41] her say sorry one more time I dare you

[00:47:36] getting hit and Navia Emily gets hit oh
[00:47:38] I'm hit Navia getting hit oh sorry I
[00:47:41] unplug my iug my headset I can't hear

[00:48:02] okay that's not Navia that's official
[00:48:05] dude okay I don't know about Japanese I
[00:48:07] usually play in English but like
[00:48:09] whenever Navia talks she starts with
[00:48:10] like a yes okay maybe on Japanese wait
[00:48:14] where's heavy hit
[00:48:17] taken okay I mean whatever I don't know
[00:48:20] anyways uh let me build my teams really
[00:48:22] quick and then we can go do stuff I'm
[00:48:25] not wearing a bathroom it's a lab I'm a
[00:48:27] I'm a perfume chemist what's her uh
[00:48:30] party join
[00:48:33] animation it's okay I
[00:48:36] mean I like this last pose she's kind of
[00:48:38] like you know
[00:48:40] compation she has
[00:48:44] style first part's kind of whatever let
[00:48:47] me add her in every single team that I
[00:48:49] conveniently have here I don't know how
[00:48:50] they got here I don't know how the
[00:48:52] someone could have possibly made these
[00:48:53] teams before she came out but that's I
[00:48:55] mean that's a story question for another
[00:48:57] time I guess a tail for another tadler
[00:49:00] let's put this
[00:49:02] here let's put this
[00:49:05] here let's put this
[00:49:08] here let's put this here okay that's
[00:49:15] it
[00:49:20] okay you will be player with guu and
[00:49:23] rizzly what the [ __ ] are you on okay the
[00:49:25] G one is copium but rizzly Emily is
[00:49:27] actually pretty good allegedly I mean
[00:49:29] you'll see but
[00:49:34] yeah okay anyways I will also say okay
[00:49:38] I'm saying this with zero
[00:49:43] sskk okay usually when I make a
[00:49:45] character guide I have footage before
[00:49:48] the character's out and I make the video
[00:49:50] okay this time I don't so I need to get
[00:49:53] extra footage
[00:49:55] today and I have like I've looked into
[00:49:59] her and I know how to build her and I've
[00:50:00] started but I haven't played her so I
[00:50:02] need to test some things so um I I'm
[00:50:06] going to say there will be a learning
[00:50:07] curve but she looks like the easiest
[00:50:09] [ __ ] character in the world you just
[00:50:10] do this and then you swap wow that was
[00:50:12] hard Emily but uh yeah but I have to
[00:50:15] test the teams I also need to see if she
[00:50:18] works as well as I think she does with
[00:50:21] nevet because there's a chance she
[00:50:22] doesn't but I think she does assuming
[00:50:25] you don't [ __ ] up the aura
[00:50:43] NE without finina is bricked okay you
[00:50:45] are do you not know who this character
[00:50:47] is are you are you did you just install
[00:50:49] the game it's [ __ ] nevet he could
[00:50:52] have no clothes and he'd still perform
[00:50:54] what okay I'm I'm I'm judging you right
[00:50:56] now what what team do you have in the
[00:50:57] abyss what team did you
[00:51:02] preload minus 9 Nita what the [ __ ] are
[00:51:06] you
[00:51:07] playing what even is
[00:51:10] this I mean I guess it's hyper
[00:51:13] Bloom but like
[00:51:16] why wait who's your are you Auto
[00:51:18] attacking on is your Dory C6 oh my God
[00:51:21] she is
[00:51:28] oh we have 220 ping okay that's going to
[00:51:30] take some getting used to it'll be
[00:51:43] okay so je uh uh Dory C6 works as a
[00:51:46] hyper driver I know but why is like I
[00:51:49] feel like lenette so if even if that's
[00:51:52] true why is Lynette there
[00:52:01] that's a
[00:52:02] sneak because meow
[00:52:06] okay meta is poop I love men okay why
[00:52:11] did I read that okay uh we're going to
[00:52:13] do some gameplay now okay we're going to
[00:52:15] do should I test her first I mean I
[00:52:18] should just play I'll just play let me
[00:52:20] see her build though okay I'm going to
[00:52:23] do two things on Emily firstly
[00:52:28] I want to try low
[00:52:30] ER and I want to try High ER right now
[00:52:34] we're High er do you have an attack
[00:52:36] Sands you do but it sucks
[00:52:38] penis
[00:52:42] um this one might unironically be
[00:52:50] better it's not bad like your build's
[00:52:52] still good but your sand sucks
[00:52:59] I'm going to do one one plus four
[00:53:01] without asking you and then if it rolls
[00:53:02] crit rate I'll ask you if I can plus 20
[00:53:04] it [ __ ]
[00:53:08] okay
[00:53:10] um brother you have
[00:53:19] 200m oh that's what I wanted to do okay
[00:53:21] you're Jong
[00:53:23] Lee okay uh yeah he's going on deepwood
[00:53:26] sorry Cole sorry Cole or D traveler who
[00:53:28] do you care less about probably D
[00:53:30] traveler
[00:53:32] sorry oh never mind you don't even have
[00:53:33] it on D okay sorry
[00:53:35] Cole but yeah so je a big a big upside
[00:53:39] of uh Jang Lee with Emily is that you
[00:53:42] can go
[00:53:47] deepwood I mean okay I'm sorry for your
[00:53:49] teams uh you can go deep with J
[00:53:52] Lee and then your uh Emily can go a dam
[00:53:56] Dage set like
[00:53:57] Ry and then you're
[00:54:10] pogging so
[00:54:15] yeah we're not going to start with nevet
[00:54:18] we'll start with um we'll start with our
[00:54:20] Lino everyone's
[00:54:24] favorite Kino is that a word I don't
[00:54:26] know uh arino Bennett Emily
[00:54:31] kazwa he does not have the four piece
[00:54:33] wait
[00:54:34] what okay I didn't sleep last night so I
[00:54:37] if that's true I'm yes he does you
[00:54:40] [ __ ] he doesn't have a five
[00:54:42] piece I know what I'm
[00:54:44] doing I built characters for a living
[00:54:48] I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:54:50] um okay second half we'll play I don't
[00:54:54] know just like some Hydro [ __ ] boom boom
[00:54:57] [ __ ] it it's nevet it doesn't matter
[00:54:59] we'll just put jangly in here and then
[00:55:01] well you have C6 Navia well maybe not
[00:55:03] for second half cuz you need Hydro but I
[00:55:05] mean I you could probably still just put
[00:55:07] a [ __ ] C6 Navia here right boom boom
[00:55:11] is your CH chori C1 I assume she is cuz
[00:55:13] you're a s oh she's not okay uh that's
[00:55:17] fine we'll put finina and kakomi
[00:55:28] okay again I have not played this
[00:55:31] character also oh we're a bit low on
[00:55:32] crit rate we have 62 if I get a crit
[00:55:34] card it's fine if not I mean it's fine
[00:55:39] whatever uh let me record this for back

[00:56:01] you know e and then Emily and then you
[00:56:03] burning and then you swirl longer up
[00:56:05] time
[00:56:09] sure oh that Kazo is not on two and then
[00:56:13] this well I mean they're dead so it
[00:56:15] doesn't really matter
[00:56:17] but okay I mean this is just arino but
[00:56:19] can I

[00:57:26] have no clue what the [ __ ] uh like I
[00:57:29] forget what uh Navia constellations do
[00:57:32] so I'm just going to play her like she
[00:57:33] CZ and expect more
[00:57:39] damage
[00:57:43] okay okay it looks like that's what's
[00:57:48] happening let me do this Oh wrong
[00:57:50] character I me an AIA

[00:59:01] take
[00:59:13] that so it should just like ramp up in
[00:59:15] damage as we get sense like that was
[00:59:17] another one now it's doing 10K ticks she
[00:59:20] doesn't snapshot I'm pretty sure so this

[01:05:40] thinking about Emily
[01:05:56] okay we're fine we're fine we're fine I
[01:05:57] actually think it's optimal to burst
[01:05:59] here so I can reat and then I let it
[01:06:02] cook and then I eat get particles on
[01:06:04] kazwa burst that [ __ ] benit that [ __ ] do
[01:06:09] that
[01:06:22] [ __ ] [ __ ] I wanted to end in style
[01:06:27] well I mean no style for us I
[01:06:30] guess I'm doing nothing now I thought I
[01:06:33] could end in
[01:06:38] style I mean anyways like it's basically
[01:06:41] cleared okay that counts as a
[01:06:47] clear
[01:06:49] okay well we know she works with
[01:06:53] Aro uh I want to try something else
[01:06:56] though I want to try uh what's her name
[01:06:59] or actually I want to try
[01:07:02] rly now the problem with this
[01:07:06] team actually let's just play
[01:07:15] [Music]
[01:07:17] it do you have BYU you don't do you
[01:07:22] have I just ch whatever
[01:07:29] actually we just do Kaz
[01:07:51] jungly uh I'm going to be honest I
[01:07:53] haven't really thought about this
[01:07:54] rotation but
[01:07:56] I assume we just
[01:07:58] burn maybe rly Q at the start but I'm
[01:08:02] not going to use this burst here I
[01:08:03] definitely should group
[01:08:05] them oh yeah I'm c
[01:08:08] one so I can like weave in charge dox
[01:08:10] okay
[01:08:17] cool bro stop hitting me I am a kid
[01:08:23] man I don't know if you on REM like I'm
[01:08:25] trying not to burst before I eat but
[01:08:27] maybe you're not on I have no clue wait
[01:08:28] you're probably on M say I'm going to
[01:08:30] assume you're on
[01:08:31] yeah yeah have to charge
[01:08:35] that I'm believe he's doing like 40ks
[01:08:37] there that's actually not
[01:08:39] bad for a character you like ignore
[01:08:48] completely oh [ __ ] forgot the enemies
[01:08:50] are here
[01:09:00] y I'm sorry I'm
[01:09:09] sorry me when I party rock I'm sorry for
[01:09:12] I'm sorry
[01:09:18] [Music]
[01:09:26] okay honestly not bad I agree it was
[01:09:29] probably the worst grouping of all time
[01:09:32] [Music]
[01:09:40] however still did the
[01:09:44] trick I'm going to use these balls just
[01:09:46] to apply hydro and I'm going to do this
[01:09:49] okay or not or not we're going to push
[01:09:51] them into each other it's going to swrl
[01:09:54] pyro but that just gives us a few so all
[01:09:57] good should have
[01:10:06] [Music]
[01:10:16] bursted me when I'm never
[01:10:19] at whoa this game is easy
[01:10:26] wait I actually haven't heard uh neet's
[01:10:28] Japanese voice in so long it's going to
[01:10:30] be like
[01:10:32] [ __ ] PTSD is not the right word but
[01:10:34] PTSD cuz I'm watching psyche right
[01:10:48] now okay skill
[01:10:52] damage t
[01:10:55] oh [ __ ] I have no energy
[01:10:58] please I'm sorry it's fine we don't need
[01:11:01] it I don't know why I just charge
[01:11:11] attacked okay I got I was like I'm on
[01:11:13] 220 ping I think I have to dodge a
[01:11:14] little bit
[01:11:16] earlier he's about to dash out of our oh
[01:11:19] [ __ ] I suck he's going to dash out of
[01:11:21] our Circle but at least we snapshot this
[01:11:23] it's fine RZ is going to get less damage
[01:11:24] though yeah
[01:11:49] okay I mean this is fine we clear but I
[01:11:51] think I could do better I just I
[01:11:53] shouldn't have been aled I think
[01:11:58] [Music]
[01:12:02] so I don't have my [ __ ] pado
[01:12:09] here I guess I do have
[01:12:12] it oh I [ __ ] canceled the
[01:12:20] N5 no I guessed too early fine we blame
[01:12:24] ping in this house hold ooh we got the
[01:12:26] dash early that's

[01:15:26] R the AL is like DPS L here honestly
[01:15:31] yeah I should not have done that fine I

[01:15:46] whatever oh I swirled
[01:15:48] Electro actually it's fine
[01:15:59] hello
[01:16:00] B
[01:16:09] sorry okay I mean we don't have to do
[01:16:11] second half it's whatever it's just
[01:16:12] never let
[01:16:17] okay uh other team I want to play is
[01:16:21] well Lenny but we don't have Lenny um so
[01:16:24] so I kind of want to try what's your
[01:16:26] Bennett
[01:16:27] cons
[01:16:30] six okay I kind of want to
[01:16:33] try this
[01:16:36] team and Emily can normal attack here
[01:16:40] well it doesn't really matter who's
[01:16:41] normal attacking cuz it's like you know
[01:16:45] but
[01:16:48] yeah but finina is actually forward
[01:16:50] vaping
[01:17:03] so having a what the [ __ ] is this
[01:17:05] feather I mean it's not bad
[01:17:08] HP I mean yes it's efficient stats I
[01:17:11] guess
[01:17:14] uh see me personally though I'm more of
[01:17:17] a crit damage kind of guy
[01:17:26] although I actually don't know how
[01:17:29] much energy we generate here it actually
[01:17:32] actually probably need more ER than
[01:17:34] that yeah we probably need more than
[01:17:36] yeah we definitely need more than
[01:17:40] 160
[01:17:43] um brother what the [ __ ] wait you're
[01:17:46] doing all this not just cuz you don't
[01:17:48] have festering desire that's actually
[01:17:50] wait key is lowkey okay I'm not joking
[01:17:53] key might actually be like insane
[01:17:56] here like no joke he might actually be
[01:17:58] like best in slot well outside of her
[01:18:01] like signature cuz you're you're forward
[01:18:03] vaping so the the Buffs actually
[01:18:07] matter sorry
[01:18:12] NE you have an ER sand oh my this 11 ER
[01:18:16] I mean the attack's wasted but 11 ER
[01:18:18] with a little bit of HP is not useless
[01:18:21] it's not
[01:18:22] useless like we take those and economy
[01:18:25] 56 147 yeah I'm
[01:18:35] cooked it's honestly not it's actually
[01:18:37] pretty decent I'm not I'm kind of joking
[01:18:39] we don't need this H do we need 200 Dr
[01:18:42] we might need 200 Dr do we have a fav
[01:18:44] Shang Ling's not on fav no we don't have
[01:18:46] fav honestly we might need 200 Dr okay
[01:18:48] this is probably fine
[01:19:00] [Music]
[01:19:02] second half doesn't
[01:19:06] matter but I do want more
[01:19:11] Hydro
[01:19:12] um
[01:19:21] whatever okay
[01:19:31] I have no clue what the [ __ ] wait let me
[01:19:34] think what the [ __ ] is my
[01:19:42] rotation okay it's probably just Emily
[01:19:44] Bennett changling finina probably I mean
[01:19:48] I could start with finina but then you
[01:19:49] have to like remove the hydro I mean
[01:19:52] it's probably not even hard okay [ __ ] it
[01:19:54] I'm start with finina see what
[01:19:56] happens we're not going to trigger
[01:19:58] burning at the start but we should
[01:19:59] trigger it pretty
[01:20:01] fast yeah like right now okay yeah
[01:20:04] that's fine okay wait there's actually
[01:20:07] yo if they were a group they'd be dead
[01:20:08] right now that's actually pretty
[01:20:11] good I mean obviously it's going to be
[01:20:13] good cuz everyone in this team is good
[01:20:14] but oh Bennett might need more healing
[01:20:16] though you have to kind of change
[01:20:17] Bennett's uh build for this team I don't
[01:20:19] know what he's
[01:20:23] on cuz you need to overheal for your
[01:20:25] finina to actually like I mean I guess
[01:20:27] you could just quick swap like here we
[01:20:29] just swap boom boom swap boom
[01:20:33] boom I don't know why I'm redeploying my
[01:20:36] e but whatever I guess and then here I
[01:20:39] would like finina I went to benett by
[01:20:41] accident you do this then you do Bennett
[01:20:43] I mean there's like it's annoying cuz
[01:20:45] it's multi-wave so the NX enemies aren't
[01:20:47] spawning here but do this some
[01:20:51] normals pina's vaping for like a million
[01:20:55] well that was 100K but or I mean 10K but
[01:20:58] usually it's a million okay
[01:21:14] [Music]
[01:21:16] this yeah like these guys are just
[01:21:18] [ __ ] dead but you know you can funnel
[01:21:22] her easily honestly
[01:21:24] I feel like yeah Shang Ling might not
[01:21:26] actually need ER in this well obviously
[01:21:28] she needs ER
[01:21:30] but she might not need as much as we
[01:21:32] have how much do we have that team
[01:21:34] worked though definitely
[01:21:37] works
[01:21:39] 202 I
[01:21:45] mean that's just like free ER cuz of our
[01:21:48] weapon I mean unless you're like Gooma
[01:21:51] but
[01:22:00] no crit rate okay I'm not to try it
[01:22:03] though I want to see I want to
[01:22:04] see well no you probably still need like
[01:22:07] 180 in this team there's no way you need
[01:22:08] less than [ __ ] like it's probably
[01:22:11] still
[01:22:12] fine anyways okay that Team Works we
[01:22:15] don't need to do a full
[01:22:16] clear uh what else do I want to play I
[01:22:20] want to try nevet with her now again
[01:22:24] here the damage doesn't matter I want to
[01:22:26] see if the up time is
[01:22:29] cooked but we're probably going to kill
[01:22:31] things so fast because it's
[01:22:33] nevet uh but I will keep an eye out for
[01:22:37] up time although Net's I mean he's good
[01:22:41] everywhere but this isn't really like
[01:22:42] the best like content for him like first
[01:22:45] half second half he's amazing but
[01:22:47] anyways
[01:22:52] um no
[01:23:02] okay so how are we doing
[01:23:05] this jeang Lee or Emily
[01:23:11] uh there's no way you start with
[01:23:14] Hydro boom boom boom right let's just do
[01:23:17] like normal stuff now we'll see
[01:23:31] yeah like in AE it's hard to obviously
[01:23:32] it's hard to burning everyone cuz you
[01:23:34] have to like stand next to them with
[01:23:35] Shang Ling but like assuming like okay
[01:23:37] let's say I just burst
[01:23:41] here and then I have my well I don't
[01:23:43] have my Pyon but like let's say I have
[01:23:44] my Pyon that was burning that's another
[01:23:47] burning we should be able to get our
[01:23:49] sense yeah that looks fine let me do it
[01:23:50] again here I'll just press e strongly
[01:24:11] yeah I mean I guess I'll I might as well
[01:24:14] clear but
[01:24:23] [Music]
[01:24:28] oh I didn't kill the thing wait no I
[01:24:31] need energy energy wait don't kill yet
[01:24:33] don't kill yet don't kill yet funnel
[01:24:35] particles funnel particles okay it's
[01:24:38] fine not
[01:24:42] bad let me shadow play that I wasn't
[01:24:44] recording just to have it
[01:24:48] okay 839 I lowkey don't know if we can
[01:24:51] clear the second half but it's okay I
[01:24:53] was kind of just testing
[01:24:55] stuff why did I Che oral here cuz I'm
[01:24:58] stupid okay okay
[01:25:02] sorry
[01:25:08] [Applause]
[01:25:09] y I'm going to do this now I swap back
[01:25:11] to Navia my EAS up and then I tap e
[01:25:14] boom I'm giving this five booms on the
[01:25:16] boom meter boom boom boom
[01:25:27] going try to save some stamina here just
[01:25:28] do some normals oh yeah we clear this
[01:25:31] easy I
[01:25:32] mean this Navia isn't fair so it's okay
[01:25:36] do this I'm not going to free a burst
[01:25:47] this okay
[01:25:54] why do you always cut it off at three on
[01:25:56] five like the academics meme wait what
[01:25:58] does that even mean oh the booms dude
[01:26:00] I'm not doing five [ __ ]
[01:26:03] booms you think I'm that desperate for
[01:26:05] your gratifi like your uh
[01:26:11] gratification okay honestly let's not
[01:26:13] use pado here just kill this
[01:26:18] guy that was okay that was actually
[01:26:20] pretty bad though wait let me try this I
[01:26:22] think we need pado well we don't need to
[01:26:23] it's just the first half but I kind of
[01:26:25] want to see how the reactions work so
[01:26:26] we're going to
[01:26:27] pado even though it's technically a
[01:26:29] waste cuz he's like immune to
[01:26:41] damage
[01:26:43] boom energy
[01:26:47] please I just want to see how it
[01:26:51] works
[01:26:53] um wait wait
[01:26:55] honestly that was actually like not bad
[01:26:57] up time on like burning you get Vapes
[01:27:00] you get burning you get a random Burgin
[01:27:02] from time to time you get [ __ ] random
[01:27:04] crystallized from time to
[01:27:06] time he's going to dash away from us now
[01:27:09] and I'm going to lose all my balls of
[01:27:10] course but it's okay Shang Ling needs a
[01:27:13] bit more ER in this team so like ignore
[01:27:16] the performance cuz I could be doing
[01:27:17] better
[01:27:20] but I think it looks like it works I
[01:27:22] mean here I should be closer to him
[01:27:24] still have burning oh no now Hydro
[01:27:25] overtook it but now it's
[01:27:31] yeah honestly I kind of [ __ ] with this
[01:27:33] team a
[01:27:38] lot like that actually I actually really
[01:27:41] like that
[01:27:48] team I don't know why I started with uh
[01:27:50] kokomi but
[01:27:52] whatever yo do I want to do 123 not
[01:27:56] really but I guess I will okay let's do
[01:27:59] it okay yeah tell him you get him boss
[01:28:05] yeah
[01:28:17] woohoo okay I missed the [ __ ] I
[01:28:20] missed
[01:28:28] can you they're dead I'm just going to
[01:28:30] assume they're dead next enemy spawn
[01:28:32] here I don't even know why I ran back
[01:28:33] group up group up okay they're not
[01:28:34] grouping okay that's fine I guess I'll
[01:28:36] just [ __ ] die then I guess I'll just
[01:28:39] die doesn't
[01:28:47] matter [ __ ] it chori DPS okay whatever
[01:29:01] dude several potatoes shut the [ __ ]
[01:29:08] up sorry okay we do not have pyron here
[01:29:15] so whatever I guess this isn't going to
[01:29:18] do anything let's just wait for pado I
[01:29:20] don't have enough ar oh I should have
[01:29:21] crit crit please oh I crit okay I got
[01:29:29] it okay let me just wait cuz I'm kind of
[01:29:33] cooked
[01:29:34] anyways actually no let's not
[01:29:37] waiton
[01:29:39] Emily and then [ __ ]
[01:29:43] it I should have
[01:29:50] waited WR The Shield wore off but and
[01:29:54] then pado off okay honestly the off time
[01:29:56] is not bad I just need
[01:30:02] [Music]
[01:30:06] pado oh [ __ ]
[01:30:10] I I'm so [ __ ]
[01:30:16] [Music]
[01:30:22] bad oh
[01:30:24] I mean I have to dis charge attack here
[01:30:26] but I I need
[01:30:29] pado we get a crit
[01:30:34] no I think I just wait here like I'm not
[01:30:37] going to use everything for
[01:30:38] nothing go should be able to hit him
[01:30:40] though okay
[01:30:45] well I love this enemy bad chest
[01:30:54] bad
[01:31:01] chesting I mean I guess I should just
[01:31:03] pado but I don't want
[01:31:13] to okay
[01:31:21] [Music]
[01:31:51] this is like really good burning up time
[01:31:55] which is good cuz that means that like
[01:31:57] the team works and like if the damage is
[01:31:59] ever low it's just the build or I stock
[01:32:01] or something but like that actually
[01:32:02] means the team Works which is pretty
[01:32:04] good obviously like no finina there
[01:32:08] but
[01:32:10] yeah okay cool
[01:32:16] um also we kind of need to fix our build
[01:32:19] cuz we're on [ __ ] 62 crit rate I
[01:32:22] acknowledge that and also
[01:32:28] like way too much
[01:32:32] y are you drinking black coffee cuz I
[01:32:35] hate
[01:32:40] myself what the [ __ ] is
[01:32:51] this okay that's disrespectful low key
[01:32:55] what is your um wait what's your B on is
[01:32:57] he on the
[01:33:03] bless
[01:33:10] understandable okay let me try
[01:33:14] uh I'm going to use a portable Waypoint
[01:33:16] of
[01:33:17] yours minus one rip bozo
[01:33:29] honestly maybe I don't have to but dude
[01:33:31] okay am I am I coping just say if I am
[01:33:33] is this Abyss not the worst thing to
[01:33:35] test ever it's like five waves of
[01:33:37] enemies first half then second half is
[01:33:39] pyro Shields then it's magu keni and
[01:33:42] [ __ ] PMA or whatever it's called
[01:33:44] asimon like are you [ __ ] I'd rather
[01:33:47] write an assignment it's like the worst
[01:33:49] Abyss ever
[01:34:01] dude like I don't
[01:34:11] know do you have a portable Waypoint if
[01:34:13] you don't I'm going to come I don't know
[01:34:15] why I said that mask of me wait what is
[01:34:19] this that looks awfully
[01:34:21] familiar wait you don't have a portable
[01:34:23] way
[01:34:26] point that's not very aboba of you well
[01:34:31] we got one
[01:34:35] shot okay I'm not going to Emily
[01:34:40] burst which does mean a bit less app
[01:34:47] but again I'm not looking at damage here
[01:34:49] I just want to see up time
[01:34:54] [Music]
[01:34:58] that's
[01:34:59] good okay I I like this team I've
[01:35:02] decided I like the net team I have
[01:35:05] decided uh a few teams to actually try I
[01:35:08] mean maybe we'll just no we'll probably
[01:35:10] just do another abys
[01:35:14] run oh yeah we can they spawn in 10
[01:35:17] seconds we can do the trial spam
[01:35:19] now okay but you still want to TP away
[01:35:21] though because if you're in I don't
[01:35:23] think you can enter trial mid combat can
[01:35:24] you cuz like mid com you don't want to
[01:35:26] kill it I guess you can kill it cuz it
[01:35:28] respawns but you sometimes you want to
[01:35:30] save your bursts so you can't really
[01:35:33] like you can wait can
[01:35:37] you
[01:35:41] anyways uh let me try some other stuff
[01:35:47] play strongly with DEA I don't think so
[01:35:50] cuz DEA would be good if she's your only
[01:35:53] pyro but if she's your only pyro you
[01:35:54] don't have enough pyro So Pro like I
[01:35:56] don't think it's enough pyro that
[01:35:57] actually it's definitely not enough pyro
[01:35:58] so you're not triggering anything and
[01:36:00] then
[01:36:03] uh with instead of Jong Lee it would be
[01:36:06] fine if you're C1 but if you're C1 you'd
[01:36:08] probably rather run forina but cuz with
[01:36:11] c0 there's no way it's better than
[01:36:14] [ __ ] I mean maybe it's not we can try
[01:36:16] but there's no way it's better than the
[01:36:18] [ __ ] uh what is this 45% you're no
[01:36:20] not 45 35% damage you're missing
[01:36:24] it's not just damage bonus it's like 35%
[01:36:26] more damage cuz it's like you're scaling
[01:36:29] so uh I mean okay we can I'll try it
[01:36:32] actually just to say I tried it cuz
[01:36:52] maybe P just do this
[01:37:03] this yeah like I mean dude this is so
[01:37:07] bad for testing we'll wait for the next
[01:37:09] wave of enemies let me wait for the next
[01:37:11] enemies this one doesn't matter just
[01:37:13] [ __ ] die please don't make me burst
[01:37:15] you I'm just going to charge I don't
[01:37:16] care I don't care I do not care
[01:37:19] [ __ ] I don't care you think I
[01:37:20] care I don't I [ __ ] don't
[01:37:24] just die okay
[01:37:27] strongly we'll do Emily first then we'll
[01:37:29] do de got some
[01:37:40] burning I mean honestly
[01:37:57] and if you do that you might not need uh
[01:37:59] you don't need jly anymore so you could
[01:38:01] probably run
[01:38:12] Kaza oh here you have well you're just
[01:38:16] not going to get any Vapes well you'll
[01:38:18] get like I mean that's not true actually
[01:38:20] you'll get the occasional Vape that
[01:38:22] actually wasn't bad
[01:38:24] was better than I
[01:38:31] [Music]
[01:38:40] thought as nevet being nevet yeah but
[01:38:43] like that's the problem with a support
[01:38:44] character cuz naturally her good teams
[01:38:46] are going to be with good characters so
[01:38:47] if I play arino you'll say that's arino
[01:38:49] being arino if I play with nevet you'll
[01:38:50] say that's nevet being nevet if I play
[01:38:52] with FAL if I play with Jong if I play
[01:38:54] with Nikita if I play her with kazua if
[01:38:56] I play her with literally any character
[01:38:58] that's just how the game works sorry you
[01:39:00] just got the game but like yeah I I
[01:39:03] don't know I'm trying I'm trying to
[01:39:04] figure it
[01:39:10] out that's why I'm looking at like up
[01:39:12] time more so than just damage numbers
[01:39:14] cuz
[01:39:17] like right let's see well de [ __ ] wor
[01:39:21] off de's like de's worse up time which
[01:39:23] is kind of annoying
[01:39:25] but do this
[01:39:35] this yeah I feel like Hydro overtakes it
[01:39:38] at the end but then when you have to
[01:39:39] like stop for a second the charge attack
[01:39:40] again you he gets burning
[01:39:45] again okay I'm
[01:39:48] in
[01:39:52] works but yeah if you're playing there
[01:39:54] you you don't need drong anymore you
[01:39:55] could run like Kaza or something or well
[01:39:58] yeah I guess finina but that probably be
[01:40:01] too much Hydra actually so yeah not
[01:40:03] forina um okay I want to play I mean I
[01:40:07] could play CLE I don't know if I want to
[01:40:08] play CLE is your CLE
[01:40:13] geared I
[01:40:17] mean kind
[01:40:19] of dude I don't know the I I don't know
[01:40:21] if I've ever played CLE like ironically
[01:40:23] in my
[01:40:24] life
[01:40:26] um
[01:40:29] um okay I also want to try now this one
[01:40:32] might be copium but I want to try Claren
[01:40:37] Emily
[01:40:39] FAL Thomas I do want to try this team I
[01:40:42] do I do sorry I do I I I do want to try
[01:40:47] it cuz in theory it should work like the
[01:40:50] reactions should line up provided I
[01:40:51] don't suck
[01:40:54] quick burn you do this you do this you T
[01:40:58] and then you
[01:40:59] T and
[01:41:06] then okay this might be the worst
[01:41:08] grouping of all time but like okay let
[01:41:11] me actually group so I can actually kill
[01:41:13] them but like in theory it should work
[01:41:16] cuz that might have been the worst
[01:41:17] grouping I've ever done in my life all
[01:41:19] good though all good though
[01:41:31] burst wait what where was my burst
[01:41:34] bro I'm not going to burst on chin cuz I
[01:41:36] don't want
[01:41:39] to okay low
[01:41:42] key wait low key we kind of [ __ ] them
[01:41:52] up I'm not getting my burst fast enough
[01:41:54] on Toma though I don't know what your
[01:41:56] TOA build is I didn't check but I just
[01:41:57] missed my e no Jeepers
[01:42:00] Shaggy I missed like five E waa that is
[01:42:04] not
[01:42:09] POG how do I oh you're on [ __ ] Kain I
[01:42:13] mean kain's good but I'm not used to
[01:42:15] using it so I keep pressing e and then I
[01:42:16] lose energy or wait no wait what the
[01:42:19] [ __ ] is happening
[01:42:24] it's been a
[01:42:32] while it's not contain I don't know what
[01:42:34] the [ __ ] is
[01:42:36] happening I guess it's just
[01:42:40] Toma
[01:42:41] sorry
[01:42:46] I but like okay I mean it's hard to show
[01:42:49] here but
[01:42:53] like the basically the point is the
[01:42:55] enemy ends up never like the burning
[01:42:58] Aura can coexist with Quicken but it
[01:43:00] never like overtakes it like it never
[01:43:02] ends up being burning in this team cuz
[01:43:04] you have so much [ __ ] Electro so the
[01:43:05] team actually even though I wouldn't
[01:43:08] play it over like a Kaza here like you
[01:43:11] know chlorin Nita kazwa whatever
[01:43:15] um it actually like works like it's
[01:43:19] fine or
[01:43:21] Soo um yeah
[01:43:24] it's not like it's not going to be
[01:43:25] better than like you know Nikita kazua
[01:43:27] but if you want to play the team like it
[01:43:29] actually kind of works cuz look like let
[01:43:31] me I mean it's better for it looks more
[01:43:33] single targy kind of Emily's versus AOE
[01:43:37] the rest of her kid kind of
[01:43:39] isn't
[01:43:41] um I don't know why it's normal but like
[01:43:45] like once you start applying Electro
[01:43:47] well there they're burning but like once
[01:43:48] you start playing Electra you start
[01:43:49] getting pretty good quickens but it's
[01:43:51] hard to show cuz enemies [ __ ] die
[01:43:56] but that's just a
[01:43:58] theory I pressed two AO what is this
[01:44:19] B I don't want to use my burst just cuz
[01:44:21] I don't feel like it but you should be
[01:44:23] using it I'm just trying to like look
[01:44:25] see like this guy's like Perma quickened
[01:44:26] like look at all these
[01:44:28] aggravates like obviously they die
[01:44:30] faster if I bursted but like it was like
[01:44:32] almost like we had really good up time
[01:44:37] okay not sure if you're burning enough
[01:44:39] well yes you are
[01:44:41] so uh anyways like it's not the point
[01:44:44] cuz she's just a sub DPS right so as
[01:44:45] long as you're like triggering burning
[01:44:46] enough for her lamp and passive you're
[01:44:50] chilling cuz she can only get a scent
[01:44:52] every like what 2 point something
[01:44:54] seconds what is it I don't know actually
[01:44:56] it's been a while uh scent what the [ __ ]
[01:45:01] is the scent it's under
[01:45:04] skill every two seconds yeah once every
[01:45:06] two seconds you can get a scent which
[01:45:08] happens when you burn or deal damage to
[01:45:10] an enemy that's burning which should be
[01:45:12] happening in that
[01:45:14] team so yeah it works um another team I
[01:45:19] want to try is that team with alyam but
[01:45:22] you don't have Alam
[01:45:25] um
[01:45:30] and so I I kind of want to try gelt but
[01:45:35] the problem with
[01:45:36] gelt is it kind of makes me want to not
[01:45:40] be alive anymore if you're not running a
[01:45:43] shield and I don't think so with like
[01:45:46] okay if you're playing let's say you're
[01:45:49] playing Nita right you can do like some
[01:45:51] Nita teams where you don't need a lot of
[01:45:53] because Nita is reapplying dendro on the
[01:45:55] burning and then you have like burn melt
[01:45:58] and then you can run a
[01:45:59] shielder
[01:46:01] however I do not think actually I'm just
[01:46:05] going to say it Emily does not apply
[01:46:06] that much dendro so in a team like this
[01:46:08] you need like Shang Ling or or someone
[01:46:10] right that applies
[01:46:13] pyro and in that case you don't have a
[01:46:15] shielder and
[01:46:16] I'm now I don't think de's enough maybe
[01:46:23] but I think you need Shang
[01:46:27] Ling I mean
[01:46:29] maybe but
[01:46:34] uh I'm just going to use my
[01:46:36] abilities I mean honestly if you're not
[01:46:38] bursting which you're not right it's not
[01:46:40] like you apply that much
[01:46:45] cryo like that's
[01:46:49] fine wait let me let me let me uh you
[01:46:52] can charge off faster than I was doing I
[01:46:54] was trying to like look but let me let
[01:46:55] me try to do it a bit
[01:46:59] faster I don't know if this G is geared
[01:47:02] okay so don't judge the damage we're
[01:47:03] just testing things okay a testing
[01:47:05] stream is different from a showcase
[01:47:07] stream this is eating away at banded off
[01:47:09] time but whatever oops dude I'm lagging
[01:47:23] dude why am I actually liking D what the
[01:47:25] [ __ ] wait D might be the
[01:47:28] solution I mean that look that of time
[01:47:30] is not like ideal but and the Damage
[01:47:32] isn't Shang Ling but you
[01:47:35] know I mean okay realistically the
[01:47:37] answer is
[01:47:39] probably I mean you might be able to
[01:47:41] Kaza just pyro swirl and then it's just
[01:47:45] a it's better because you can go far you
[01:47:47] don't have to like stay close but well
[01:47:49] you don't have to stay close with de but
[01:47:50] the point is like with changling you
[01:47:52] would and then
[01:47:58] you probably D before
[01:48:05] [Music]
[01:48:09] Bennett yeah I mean that
[01:48:12] works I'm not saying it's the best team
[01:48:15] in the world but it works which is good
[01:48:16] to
[01:48:19] know now the problem there is like so
[01:48:23] some teams using Emily it's like it
[01:48:25] feels really good but in that team I
[01:48:28] can't argue against you want Nita
[01:48:30] because she just gives you a [ __ ] ton of
[01:48:32] Em which is really good like also just
[01:48:34] has solid damage solid dendr app you can
[01:48:36] play like other characters that so like
[01:48:38] I think the he is just better there but
[01:48:39] I think Emily Works which is which is
[01:48:41] cool
[01:48:45] um I want to do uh CLE clear just
[01:48:49] kidding let's do another arlino one CLE
[01:48:51] players sorry we'll do a CLE clear later
[01:48:53] maybe probably maybe not we'll see uh I
[01:48:56] want to do another AR you know one just
[01:48:57] cuz I miss her and there's no there's
[01:48:59] nothing you can do to stop me so sorry
[01:49:02] my stream little
[01:49:06] bro oh oh yeah wait was
[01:49:15] that what about huta okay well the thing
[01:49:19] with Hut is your charge tack applies Pow
[01:49:20] with no internal cooldown therefore you
[01:49:22] can vaporize every charge attack and so
[01:49:23] I cannot comprehend a world where Hut is
[01:49:26] not
[01:49:27] vaporizing you can like you can like Hut
[01:49:30] is a good character so you could kind of
[01:49:31] do whatever but I
[01:49:33] just I don't know I just
[01:49:37] like I'm a I'm a Hut
[01:49:40] Vapor but you you you can play like
[01:49:42] literally any pyro character here
[01:49:44] basically like any pyro
[01:49:47] carry um
[01:49:53] wait Chad thoughts on this no okay sorry
[01:49:59] sorry CLE okay okay I'll play
[01:50:04] CLE all
[01:50:10] right okay sorry
[01:50:39] okay I'm just going to wait before Emily
[01:50:40] bursting just cuz I want to like this
[01:50:42] this doesn't really matter we're going
[01:50:44] to e kill the
[01:50:45] guy okay now we're going to do stuff so
[01:50:48] oh they're ungrouping
[01:50:55] please
[01:50:57] okay
[01:51:03] no I'm
[01:51:13] C I'm CED okay wait wait wait I just
[01:51:16] realized something I was like oh I'm
[01:51:18] going to change my Emily build and then
[01:51:19] guess what I did I didn't okay that's
[01:51:22] really cool
[01:51:29] man I'm I'm tweaking sorry I think we do
[01:51:33] unironically I think we do deepwood the
[01:51:34] only problem is then when I play her
[01:51:36] with J Lee I need to switch
[01:51:41] back also I want to try no ER Sands like
[01:51:45] like no ER burst every other rotation
[01:51:47] [ __ ] it [ __ ]
[01:51:50] it sorry okay let's do um do you have
[01:51:54] good deep maybe maybe
[01:51:58] maybe we'll do

[01:55:19] Auto attack twice on arino yes but it's
[01:55:22] okay
[01:55:24] uh I'm going to redo that though I got
[01:55:26] what I needed from the first part let me

[01:58:17] weapon I'm going to give her
[01:58:23] Death
[01:58:24] Match ideally you have something like
[01:58:27] worse but you don't really have weapons
[01:58:29] I'm not going to put on like
[01:58:43] five does he have white tassel there's
[01:58:46] no way it's level
[01:58:48] 90 jss is a man of culture he knows what

[01:59:11] one missive windspear level one I have
[01:59:14] Harbinger

[01:59:42] your duuke level
[01:59:50] 20 Chad can you let me look up
[01:59:54] kqm
[02:00:00] CLE controlling CLE learning animation
[02:00:03] cancels oh
[02:00:05] [ __ ] normal attack animation can in C's
[02:00:08] basic attack also known as machine gun
[02:00:09] wa I know how to do that okay n1c
[02:00:12] n2c fact when should I n1c versus n2c
[02:00:16] staying still or Dash cancelling has the
[02:00:18] highest DPS St staying still can also
[02:00:21] have resistance Interruption when using
[02:00:23] an explosive spark dashing gives eye
[02:00:25] frame survivability in exchange for
[02:00:26] stamina
[02:00:29] jumping double spark Tech what the [ __ ]
[02:00:31] is double
[02:00:41] spark it is possible to quickly cue a
[02:00:44] second charge attack and get two charge
[02:00:46] attacks benefiting from a single
[02:00:48] explosive spr spark proc increasing both
[02:00:51] damage output and consuming less
[02:00:55] stamina yo Caines don't [ __ ] around what
[02:00:58] the
[02:00:59] [Music]
[02:01:03] hell okay I got
[02:01:16] it not on 200 Ms though oh

[02:02:33] going to do this
[02:02:35] this
[02:02:41] this no Emily skill is more important
[02:02:43] than burst well you can level both like
[02:02:45] kind of equally if you're bursting every
[02:02:47] rotation but you don't have to
[02:03:05] I'm going to
[02:03:07] die we didn't
[02:03:20] die yeah ly if Emily didn't give us 80%

[02:03:49] UI I like how this changes literally
[02:03:52] nothing for net
[02:03:54] gameplay I literally don't even care
[02:03:56] what their HP
[02:04:03] is if anything it removes the useless
[02:04:06] [ __ ] off my screen if anything it helps
[02:04:09] level
[02:04:18] left I don't want to use my burst if I
[02:04:20] don't have to okay I don't have to I
[02:04:22] just
[02:04:31] wait bro can they die oh CLE CLE time

[02:05:26] we swirl that [ __ ] right then we do this
[02:05:27] [ __ ] then we Emily it up oh Emily
[02:05:36] then we
[02:05:39] cooked on God he cooked on your favorite
[02:05:42] archon he
[02:05:50] cooked
[02:05:57] [Music]
[02:06:15] for yeah I think her damage is uh like
[02:06:19] numbers wise
[02:06:21] it's up there with like fishal and stuff
[02:06:24] but obviously it's not the same like
[02:06:25] Elemental application like a C6 fishal
[02:06:27] is applying way more Electro her dendro
[02:06:29] app is like it it's like slow but her
[02:06:32] burst is
[02:06:33] is good dendro for AOE like it's not
[02:06:37] fast but it's not like terrible her
[02:06:40] skill's not fast
[02:06:42] though and it's very single Target
[02:06:57] [Music]
[02:07:12] almost as good as a fourstar caught okay
[02:07:14] but like unironically C6 ficial is
[02:07:16] better than every Electro five star
[02:07:18] we're not having this discussion today I
[02:07:20] don't care I haven't slept so so I don't
[02:07:21] have to filter it it's not even close
[02:07:24] like it's actually not even
[02:07:26] close so like you could say that about
[02:07:29] like I don't think like I mean I don't
[02:07:31] think Emily's like broken or anything at
[02:07:33] all like she's just you know she's
[02:07:34] pretty good but
[02:07:36] like
[02:07:37] yeah that's not really the an
[02:07:43] argument I don't have time to burst
[02:07:45] there I just I want to heal my arino but
[02:07:47] [ __ ] it I don't really have time
[02:07:51] then why does my C6 official suck cuz
[02:07:53] you suck I'm sorry I didn't say it you
[02:07:55] said it but like if your official isn't
[02:07:57] doing what fal's supposed to do maybe
[02:07:59] you should build her better I'm
[02:08:19] sorry okay on
[02:08:34] sorry wait what am my hist just at
[02:08:39] 666

[02:09:10] 8810 that's a good Kaza admittedly
[02:09:16] 1km jss your account's pretty good
[02:09:24] is triple dendro plus changling good Mr
[02:09:27] streamer let me stop you right there
[02:09:29] unless you're from version [ __ ] 6.2
[02:09:31] and there's something I don't know about
[02:09:33] I don't know you I could have stopped
[02:09:34] you at is triple dendro plus and ended
[02:09:37] the sentence there you didn't have to
[02:09:43] continue is there a single triple dendro
[02:09:46] team I've ever willingly played let me
[02:09:48] think
[02:09:54] uh I don't think
[02:09:57] so triple dendro Neu okay but why would
[02:10:01] you do that to

[02:11:51] there but I've never like I've never
[02:11:53] bought them but they're they always are
[02:11:55] there and it's like it's like pickled
[02:11:57] beast and they're from po Poland that's
[02:11:58] all I
[02:11:59] know what what death notes are out you
[02:12:01] love it I I'll read that
[02:12:10] after what does it say cabinet so bad oh
[02:12:13] cabinet C cabinet cabinet cabinet
[02:12:18] sorry unfortunately I have the uncurable
[02:12:21] debuff of speaking
[02:12:24] French wait you're telling me your
[02:12:26] Candace is level
[02:12:27] 90 but you're sing Joe okay I I I
[02:12:31] respect your priorities is she C6 I
[02:12:34] actually kind of want to play C6
[02:12:42] Candace okay I respect
[02:12:48] it can I big F
[02:12:52] um okay we can test some other stuff uh
[02:12:55] notably
[02:12:57] CLE notably well I I would say Neu like
[02:13:01] okay for the record this team works but
[02:13:05] like I don't think it's going to work
[02:13:08] like better than just any dendro here
[02:13:10] like I think it's fine but it's not like
[02:13:12] good like it's okay it's okay because
[02:13:15] her burst not only is decent for dentro
[02:13:18] app but also has uh low cooldown
[02:13:23] but you have like no damage because
[02:13:25] you're not
[02:13:26] burning but like yeah it's not like
[02:13:28] she's particularly good there it's just
[02:13:30] this team is already good and then you
[02:13:31] just put any dentro there
[02:13:37] um
[02:13:39] yeah we could do one more one more run
[02:13:42] and then we'll probably just have fun
[02:13:43] and clear
[02:13:49] stuff yeah yeah CO's really good there

[02:22:53] like a dating Sim and then it randomly

[02:23:39] thoughts okay the side of one kind of a
[02:23:42] bit
[02:23:47] better the staff looks taller it's
[02:23:50] scaled to the model
[02:23:52] dude the the the size of the size of a
[02:23:56] polearm scale of a weapon scales on the
[02:23:58] character that's why when Shia equips it
[02:24:00] it's [ __ ] massive and when yao yao
[02:24:03] equips it it's small right look at how
[02:24:04] small this looks because she's a small
[02:24:06] character right and for comparison you
[02:24:09] click on a tall character like where's
[02:24:11] Chia look at how much bigger the pole
[02:24:14] arm is you see that it scales even the
[02:24:17] same pole arm

[02:25:06] it
[02:25:09] okay uh okay what the [ __ ] was I doing
[02:25:12] Emily woo uh what do we want to play CLE
[02:25:17] I don't want to play CLE okay I'll play
[02:25:19] CLE okay okay I want to try something
[02:25:21] but please don't get mad at me okay can
[02:25:23] you promise me
[02:25:30] that okay wait actually I have a
[02:25:32] question I was going to say I'll play
[02:25:35] this team with no gear on CLE just so
[02:25:37] that it's like Emily kazua but what if I
[02:25:39] just put Shang Ling here
[02:25:54] you think I'm joking but I'm not
[02:25:58] joking like like what is the downside of
[02:26:04] [Music]
[02:26:07] this and then they're
[02:26:12] dead like did we not just [ __ ] on them
[02:26:15] sorry okay I won't use strangling burst
[02:26:18] this time cuz you're going to be like
[02:26:18] it's just strangling no strangling
[02:26:20] no shling I vow I solemnly swear I'm
[02:26:23] only going to guoba Gua get
[02:26:26] down please swil
[02:26:28] pyro I I mean I got like I know I SW
[02:26:31] power on the middle I don't know if I SW
[02:26:32] on the others I'm just going to reset
[02:26:34] [ __ ] you I I don't know okay I don't
[02:26:37] know dude shut the [ __ ] up I didn't
[02:26:48] wait they're dead they're actually dead
[02:26:57] look wait the [ __ ] thing reaches
[02:27:02] here dude I don't know like am I wrong
[02:27:05] for liking this character I like her man
[02:27:08] I like
[02:27:10] her Am I Wrong Maybe
[02:27:33] wait I have a question I should probably
[02:27:35] know this guide maker by the way okay if
[02:27:38] I burst it stores away the case and then
[02:27:42] afterwards it brings it back out okay
[02:27:43] cool I know
[02:27:44] that but what if I press my skill again
[02:27:47] does it go back to level one cuz now
[02:27:48] it's level two
[02:27:51] oh yeah that's level one okay so there's
[02:27:54] no you don't want to like I feel like
[02:27:56] you don't want to e
[02:27:58] again like I feel like using e again is
[02:28:01] bad like you basically don't press e in
[02:28:04] your whole
[02:28:05] rotation am I
[02:28:11] wrong I feel like you just don't press e
[02:28:14] well like you could EQ but um
[02:28:20] wait does it even like do you even get
[02:28:23] a it doesn't even give you a particle I
[02:28:25] mean it gives you one after it gives you
[02:28:27] particle over time
[02:28:28] but is I mean whatever it doesn't
[02:28:37] matter the dendr op is om yeah well so
[02:28:40] look look the d drop from the e is not
[02:28:43] great it's single Target
[02:28:46] right but if you burst it's like okay so
[02:28:49] that's why I think that
[02:28:50] like see it's like raining on them and
[02:28:51] then if you group them it's like it'll
[02:28:53] do like AOE but um like each hint yeah
[02:28:56] see like they just did like 50k on all
[02:28:59] of them like I didn't even do a [ __ ]
[02:29:00] I didn't even B it but like the thing is
[02:29:02] is um I
[02:29:06] think
[02:29:09] that okay I think you should
[02:29:14] burst I think burst is better than it
[02:29:17] like the numbers will say so okay I'm
[02:29:20] pretty sure if you just don't build ER
[02:29:22] and burst every other rotation you do a
[02:29:23] little bit more damage than if you burst
[02:29:25] every rotation but that's assuming like
[02:29:27] single Target and like whatever TC math
[02:29:29] assumptions are which is usually single
[02:29:31] Target one Enemy No no no and I'm pretty
[02:29:33] sure that because of the AOE and because
[02:29:35] of the dendro app it's just worth worth
[02:29:37] bursting all the time however sometimes
[02:29:41] you'll do a long rotation and then even
[02:29:43] with like kind of low ER you'll get it
[02:29:44] back by the time you swap back into her
[02:29:47] because it's it's not like that hard to
[02:29:49] get her burst
[02:29:51] I mean that's not true like if you're on
[02:29:53] like no ER you won't
[02:29:58] but
[02:30:08] anyways also okay I have to test the way
[02:30:10] her burst works I'm pretty
[02:30:14] sure that it like doesn't Target the
[02:30:17] same enemy for 7 seconds so like it
[02:30:19] won't R down on him for S and then it
[02:30:21] goes well okay it ended I mean I think
[02:30:24] that's how it
[02:30:25] works but if they're grouped like if
[02:30:28] they're grouped each shot can hit
[02:30:32] everyone let me just make sure cuz I hav
[02:30:34] I I haven't had time to test this but
[02:30:37] like this should now yeah like they're
[02:30:39] they're all on different enemies but
[02:30:40] each shot is hitting every enemy why did
[02:30:43] someone just post a [ __ ] ass in chat
[02:30:53] okay I might as well do the skill
[02:30:54] showcase now just get like background
[02:30:55] footage for
[02:30:57] editor
[02:31:02] but it's going to r on different
[02:31:08] enemies now let me group
[02:31:18] them I didn't group them no I'm
[02:31:23] sorry bro my Wi-Fi is
[02:31:27] ass I don't recall asking I'm sorry that
[02:31:30] was kind of
[02:31:39] [ __ ] oh and then your skill is back
[02:31:42] out
[02:31:52] wait I want to look at the sents I don't
[02:31:54] know what they look well I know what
[02:31:55] they look like on the thing but I
[02:31:57] haven't like seen them on the ground
[02:31:58] actually that's not sure I have seen
[02:31:59] them
[02:32:01] but I don't know maybe I want to see
[02:32:03] them
[02:32:04] [Music]
[02:32:12] again oh it's like those little plants
[02:32:21] and then it does like a dude that damage
[02:32:22] is [ __ ] huge from the
[02:32:24] passive like that that P that's passive
[02:32:27] damage that's not that's not the skill
[02:32:28] it's passive that's so much dude 55k
[02:32:31] just randomly that's no benett no
[02:32:45] nothing
[02:32:47] 82 with Bennett I mean I mean you're not
[02:32:50] going to be standing in benit circle
[02:32:57] but we're also on deepwood which is
[02:32:59] worse than
[02:33:14] Ry okay
[02:33:24] okay sorry
[02:33:29] um is deboard better if no sub boards
[02:33:31] hold it
[02:33:33] no it's still like a so it's better if
[02:33:36] you it's better to have revery on her
[02:33:39] and deut on like a jangly or something
[02:33:40] but even if you don't have deut in your
[02:33:42] team it's still better to go Ry on her
[02:33:45] unless uh just buy a little bit like
[02:33:48] they're they're pretty close just go on
[02:33:49] stats that's the real answer
[02:33:55] however
[02:34:02] um however if you have another Dental
[02:34:05] character in your team or doing yeah
[02:34:08] doing D damage outside of just Emily
[02:34:09] then deot will be better but usually
[02:34:10] you'll put deot on like your Nita not on
[02:34:12] her but if you're yeah but like let's
[02:34:14] say you're playing her with a dendro
[02:34:15] carry or something then yeah
[02:34:19] buron too but buron your niita is on
[02:34:22] deepwood
[02:34:38] [Music]
[02:34:39] so man I wish these enemies were [ __ ]
[02:34:41] tankier like they're just dead I hate I
[02:34:44] hate multi-wave content it's so [ __ ]
[02:34:45] annoying okay let me do an actual clear
[02:34:47] let me lock in
[02:34:51] cheeseburger but miss spell thanks for
[02:34:53] the prime okay let me lock
[02:35:09] in okay I [ __ ] up my rotation sorry I
[02:35:12] forgot to press E Local
[02:35:15] Legend no well not a bad idea actually
[02:35:33] okay yeah you get
[02:35:39] him there's definitely no reason for me
[02:35:41] to reuse my [ __ ]
[02:35:45] burst okay
[02:35:47] [Music]
[02:35:55] why do I keep pressing e that's fine it
[02:35:57] doesn't matter cuz my burst is
[02:36:07] [Music]
[02:36:12] out yep
[02:36:16] [Music]
[02:36:37] not
[02:36:41] bad oh [ __ ]
[02:36:44] I I was going to do a clear
[02:36:48] I
[02:37:02] for
[02:37:08] S Honestly though I feel like uh this
[02:37:12] team or is it
[02:37:19] I feel like this with like literally
[02:37:22] any not useless character kind of works
[02:37:25] well like ideally pyro
[02:37:39] but CLE
[02:37:50] dude I don't know the [ __ ] to play CLE I
[02:37:52] mean I know you're supposed to like
[02:37:53] normal charge attack
[02:38:15] but why do your pieces have so much Em
[02:38:17] I'm trying to play mono pyro here
[02:38:22] we have 182
[02:38:24] em whatever good
[02:38:43] enough no one cares about her at
[02:38:47] Zio that's [ __ ]
[02:38:53] I didn't even apply pyro I
[02:39:03] missed okay I feel like
[02:39:15] [Music]
[02:39:17] the okay wait I have no the [ __ ] to play
[02:39:20] this character
[02:39:22] wa why my charge attacks not going off
[02:39:25] what the [ __ ] is happening why are you
[02:39:27] walking
[02:39:36] [Music]
[02:39:40] back why is my charge tack no going off
[02:39:43] what the
[02:39:46] [ __ ] whatever I [ __ ] it
[02:39:53] I got to stop pressing e on
[02:40:03] Emily wait is that ping I dude I swear
[02:40:06] I'm charge attacking and it's not like
[02:40:08] triggering like I know how to [ __ ] do
[02:40:10] a charge attack
[02:40:46] uh no I would not bench fora for
[02:40:59] Emily okay enough CLE for a
[02:41:02] lifetime that was fun though that was
[02:41:05] fun that was fun that was
[02:41:08] fun uh that was
[02:41:11] fun that was
[02:41:13] fun that was
[02:41:15] fun um okay one more one more one more
[02:41:18] one more it's time to
[02:41:20] celebrate whoa one more time okay this
[02:41:25] and then
[02:41:33] this we we wanted to clear with this
[02:41:35] team but we couldn't cuz we got
[02:41:43] TD bro can you stop knocking me around
[02:41:48] it's fine
[02:42:09] now I like this team better with finina
[02:42:11] by quite a bit I think
[02:42:20] like instead of uh
[02:42:33] Kaza was that hit these
[02:42:36] guys
[02:42:44] no please stop
[02:42:53] uh
[02:43:02] well that was
[02:43:12] embarrassing okay I think we're we're
[02:43:14] done like spam resetting Abyss
[02:43:25] F instead of Shang Ling I mean I think
[02:43:27] it's finina instead of
[02:43:29] kazua cuz Shang Ling is uh Shang Ling
[02:43:33] Shang Ling
[02:43:34] man but we could play that team too I
[02:43:37] think it'll perform like it'll be fine
[02:43:39] cuz every character there's but like if
[02:43:41] you're playing I don't know if you're
[02:43:44] playing finina kazua Bennett it's almost
[02:43:46] like why is Emily like why I feel like
[02:43:48] Emily is the sneak
[02:44:04] maybe I'll try
[02:44:14] it may I ask if you got Emily's weapon
[02:44:20] uh
[02:44:45] no what the [ __ ] was that
[02:45:00] [Music]
[02:45:14] where the [ __ ] is the other one oh
[02:45:24] what a hydro swirl theree
[02:45:57] now works
[02:46:21] a lot of our Buffs are like kind of not
[02:46:24] efficient in that team though like I
[02:46:25] don't think it matters cuz it's so much
[02:46:27] but it's like we're buffing like damage
[02:46:29] so then that doesn't help the burgeon
[02:46:30] and then we're buffing attack which
[02:46:32] doesn't help the burgeon or
[02:46:34] finina and then like it only Buffs Emily
[02:46:36] which is fine and then we're buffing
[02:46:38] like and then there's like it's like so
[02:46:41] many different Buffs and the K's also
[02:46:42] double swirling and he's also giving
[02:46:44] damage bonus and he's also reducing
[02:46:45] resistance
[02:46:49] so like I don't think it matters
[02:46:52] but is it possible that the team would
[02:46:55] be better with Shang
[02:46:57] Ling wait what if instead of Emily we
[02:46:59] play Shang Ling and instead of finina we
[02:47:01] play
[02:47:13] Child am I cooking or no
[02:47:19] wait where the [ __ ] is my where are my
[02:47:42] balls thought she'd be worse cuz she
[02:47:44] needs burning which is actually good
[02:47:45] well the thing is is burning is kind of
[02:47:47] whatever like burning sucks but pyro
[02:47:50] characters are good
[02:47:51] and Emily's pretty good so it doesn't
[02:47:54] matter if you're like burning just
[02:47:56] happens doesn't matter like you're not
[02:47:58] playing for burning you're just getting
[02:48:00] burning like you're playing around
[02:48:02] burning but you're not playing for
[02:48:03] burning does that make sense no
[02:48:08] [Music]
[02:48:09] okay I meant to go [ __ ]
[02:48:14] Kaza has our finina crit once or am I
[02:48:17] dumb
[02:48:20] feel like herass is not
[02:48:25] critting I'm just going to swirl nothing
[02:48:27] to get particles I don't care
[02:48:30] anymore he's going to dash backwards
[02:48:32] here then we're going to
[02:48:33] go we're going to Unleash the Beast hash
[02:48:36] # Mr I bursted I'm on high Ping Man I
[02:48:43] bursted finina might be missing a piece
[02:48:46] do you think so honestly maybe
[02:48:59] she's on key yeah but Key's really
[02:49:14] good I just swirled
[02:49:17] nothing all
[02:49:19] [Music]
[02:49:33] good brother like can you stop [ __ ]
[02:49:35] dashing like get a job please seek seek
[02:49:39] seek a life
[02:49:53] is Emily C1 worth pulling so Emily C1 is
[02:49:56] like pretty decent but she's also just a
[02:49:58] sub DPS so even if it increases like her
[02:50:01] damage by 20% it's increasing your
[02:50:03] team's damage by like a lot less than
[02:50:05] that
[02:50:09] so make with that as you
[02:50:16] will also her weapon is
[02:50:20] like her weapon is like for her [ __ ]
[02:50:24] stupid
[02:50:26] like
[02:50:28] okay if you don't factor in the energy
[02:50:31] it's like maybe 12 like I don't know 10
[02:50:33] to 15% better than the next best five
[02:50:36] star about about 10% if you factor in
[02:50:38] the energy and you you make it you burst
[02:50:41] every rotation instead of every other
[02:50:43] rotation it's like 30% better or like
[02:50:45] over 30 well not over 30 but around 30
[02:50:48] it's like [ __ ] it's actually stupid
[02:50:50] and then compared to like the free to
[02:50:52] play option it's like 40
[02:50:55] plus it's really good uh but it's not
[02:50:59] that like again it's a sub DPS so it's
[02:51:03] not increasing your damage as much as
[02:51:05] like AR Lino's weapon or like you know a
[02:51:08] character that's doing more damage more
[02:51:11] a bigger percentage of your team's
[02:51:13] damage so like you
[02:51:14] know don't feel like you need it I'm not
[02:51:18] getting it but it is uh pretty
[02:51:23] good for
[02:51:27] Emily I mean it's also a decent stat
[02:51:29] stick even without like it's a it's a
[02:51:31] decent stat stick crit rate a high like
[02:51:33] basically Homa stats but for crit rate
[02:51:36] instead of damage and then you get 18%
[02:51:38] attack
[02:51:55] but yeah like I'm I don't think I'm
[02:51:56] going to go for
[02:52:01] it although the high crits that of it I
[02:52:05] could put it on Shia and then my my it
[02:52:07] would be a funny number like I'd have
[02:52:09] more crit does that make sense no okay
[02:52:20] I mean it's less crit rate than uh
[02:52:22] Deathmatch though cuz it's 33 this is
[02:52:25] 36 okay yeah I don't want it anymore if
[02:52:28] it was 37 I might have gotten
[02:52:30] it all right uh not my account but let's
[02:52:33] let's let's go do a Vermillion run sorry
[02:52:46] [Music]
[02:52:50] no I won't claim it I won't claim it
[02:52:53] okay calm
[02:52:56] down we're not claiming we're just
[02:52:59] having fun okay have you heard of fun I
[02:53:03] have
[02:53:08] balls maybe I just want background
[02:53:10] footage
[02:53:30] goodbye I'm not claiming I'm not
[02:53:33] claiming what okay there's a menu if you
[02:53:35] have condensed resin how was I supposed
[02:53:37] to know you had no condensed resin how
[02:53:39] was I supposed to know I'm sorry I'm
[02:53:40] sorry I'm sorry but look at
[02:53:46] this it's okay he's not here oh [ __ ]
[02:53:48] he's here okay sorry sorry sorry but now
[02:53:50] you have 7 s resin which is like that's
[02:53:53] like a shout
[02:53:56] out I'm sorry I'm
[02:54:02] sorry I'm
[02:54:04] sorry I'm
[02:54:14] sorry to s
[02:54:17] [Music]
[02:54:26] okay um I think we did the testing I
[02:54:29] need to do now all I need is like
[02:54:30] background footage which I'll probably
[02:54:32] do off stream but we can just like chill
[02:54:34] for a bit but I'll probably do that off
[02:54:36] stream and I think I'm also okay
[02:54:37] disclaimer chat I might
[02:54:42] just I might just fin like focus on the
[02:54:46] guide today so I might ALS stream again
[02:54:49] and a release but I might have to do
[02:54:51] pulls off stream like I might have to
[02:54:53] just pull skip the animations level uh
[02:54:58] Emily and then cuz I'm going to need to
[02:55:00] do a show I can't do a showcase on this
[02:55:01] account like I can get background
[02:55:03] footage but like for the end section I
[02:55:05] want to be my account so I'm going to
[02:55:06] have to wait I mean I could stream it

[03:12:01] if I Bennett and then Emily then my
[03:12:03] Emily does a bit more and then it looks
[03:12:05] better for Emily but it's definitely not

[03:16:53] 122 I blame ping I blame ping okay I
[03:16:55] blame ping ping dude I I a [ __ ]
[03:16:58] yapper what the [ __ ] is wrong with me
[03:16:59] today
[03:17:03] uh rizley
[03:17:05] 122 first one was
[03:17:09] better and
[03:17:12] then sort by date
[03:17:21] why everyone typ engage what
[03:17:45] happened no reason
[03:18:09] okay okay we'll probably do a bit more
[03:18:11] random stuff but
[03:18:14] um honestly I like Emily more than I
[03:18:17] thought I
[03:18:18] would
[03:18:37] um like I think she's
[03:18:42] good stronger than yolan comma so yeah
[03:18:45] okay I don't know about that one but
[03:18:47] outside of that comment I think she's
[03:18:48] pretty
[03:18:52] good
[03:18:54] um I I I actually I think the one thing
[03:18:58] I'm not sure of right now is her ER like
[03:19:00] I know the ER requirements like I you
[03:19:04] know I've seen the zag Cals and all that
[03:19:06] and I know but I I feel like I don't
[03:19:10] know I feel like in
[03:19:13] practicality I feel like a lot of times
[03:19:15] you're fighting a [ __ ] ton enemy and
[03:19:17] there's like a lot of stuff that makes
[03:19:18] it to where you don't need as much
[03:19:20] however I like recommending her burst
[03:19:24] more
[03:19:25] than ignoring her burst because I think
[03:19:28] the AOE helps a lot but it depends like
[03:19:31] in a rizzly Mel team I kind of don't
[03:19:32] give a [ __ ] about my burst cuz like
[03:19:35] Shang Ling Bennett are applying enough
[03:19:36] pyro she's just there for pretty good
[03:19:39] damage but I mean I guess you want a
[03:19:41] burst cuz burst is more damage but it's
[03:19:44] like is it worth the [ __ ] F like 70
[03:19:47] no more than 70 you're like [ __ ] near
[03:19:49] 200 ER in that
[03:19:53] team
[03:19:54] maybe but probably
[03:20:07] not someone said sellout do you think I
[03:20:10] get paid for saying a character is good
[03:20:12] dude sein is complete garbage I mean
[03:20:14] she's good with
[03:20:15] Navia but I think Emily's pretty good
[03:20:55] try without meta units I mean we just
[03:20:57] played rizzly I don't know if rizzly is
[03:20:58] exactly
[03:21:00] meta but like I I don't know I wouldn't
[03:21:03] play
[03:21:09] [Music]
[03:21:15] [ __ ] oh
[03:21:18] [Music]
[03:21:23] although like I don't know personally I
[03:21:25] probably would still save like I if I'm
[03:21:28] just like if I'm casual free to- play
[03:21:30] player I probably just wait for Natan
[03:21:32] realistically like I I don't I don't
[03:21:35] want you to be like o I should pull for
[03:21:37] her but I just think if you like her
[03:21:38] she's pretty good that's
[03:21:41] all and I think she'll I don't want to
[03:21:44] say she might synergize with future
[03:21:45] units cuz that's a statement based on
[03:21:47] like nothing however she probably will
[03:21:49] synergize with nine characters cuz
[03:21:57] burning okay you guys are typing sus so
[03:22:00] you probably saw something that I
[03:22:01] haven't seen however it's very realistic
[03:22:04] to assume that given that it's the Pyro
[03:22:07] region
[03:22:20] yeah the banner is ass as well keep that
[03:22:22] in mind keep in mind the four stars
[03:22:24] aren't ideal unless you don't have a C4
[03:22:27] Shang
[03:22:29] Ling um okay honestly dude I'm going to
[03:22:33] say
[03:22:35] it where the [ __ ] are Shang Ling cons
[03:22:37] let me let me let me pull them up
[03:22:39] where's your Shang
[03:22:41] Ling hello hello hello
[03:22:49] dude Shang Ling's Chili Pepper kind of
[03:22:51] dude it's cracked I know it's only 10%
[03:22:54] ATT tag but I feel like the
[03:22:57] like okay when you you know how like
[03:22:59] sometimes when you're like really you
[03:23:00] need to be confident to be able to like
[03:23:02] hit like the shot of your life and you
[03:23:04] miss every shot you don't take okay
[03:23:06] picking up the pepper on your main DPS
[03:23:08] at the right time it like gives you a
[03:23:10] confidence boost you're like oh [ __ ] I
[03:23:11] just did that and then you start dealing
[03:23:13] more damage cuz you're like locked in I
[03:23:15] I don't know man I don't know it just it
[03:23:17] just like I don't
[03:23:19] know I can't explain it but it's
[03:23:23] true you pick up the pepper you're like
[03:23:26] oh [ __ ] I just picked up the
[03:23:43] pepper
[03:23:44] Gage why Gage
[03:23:48] this mon it
[03:23:58] backs wait actually this gives me an
[03:24:00] idea let me try one last thing
[03:24:37] strength aside does she feel better than
[03:24:39] Nita with
[03:24:40] rly
[03:24:43] uh I mean in that team if I'm not
[03:24:45] playing Emily I'm usually playing either
[03:24:47] a finina thing or a a Kaza or like a
[03:24:51] Shena thing I'm not really playing Nita
[03:24:53] there but in terms of feel cuz you said
[03:24:56] strength the side you press e and swap
[03:24:59] like it's not like you know but I mean I
[03:25:03] it's pretty
[03:25:07] satisfying what was I going to do
[03:25:09] this
[03:25:11] wait I forgot how to play the game Sorry
[03:25:19] my
[03:25:29] bad I need to thr pyro whatever I mean

[03:29:30] probably play it on my account when like
[03:29:33] again like I wouldn't use it over normal
[03:29:36] quick in in my opinion but like it's
[03:29:38] pretty good or normal like quick bloom
[03:29:40] or what well no with with with uh Sino

[03:33:42] [ __ ] 1.3 sh talk if you're doing less
[03:33:46] damage than a dragon's ban sha with
[03:33:49] [ __ ] two gilded dreams I'm sorry man
[03:33:51] what do you want me to like I like I I
[03:33:53] don't know what to

[03:34:00] 822 no Bennett no farizon no finina no
[03:34:04] shenyun
[03:34:19] MAA why are you asking questions like
[03:34:21] you're a firsttime
[03:34:22] chatter here here are her teams if
[03:34:24] that's what you're
[03:34:27] wondering pyro uh wait let me go back
[03:34:31] well I I don't have Lenny but pyro pyro
[03:34:35] but forward
[03:34:36] Vape rizzly or other cryo other cryo
[03:34:41] nlet uh quick
[03:34:44] burn buron buron Virg nuu well not
[03:34:50] really n is like a meme but you kind of
[03:34:52] can but Cole is just it's just like a
[03:34:53] Col Aid too but not really better it's
[03:34:56] just yeah that's it well that's not
[03:34:58] really it but that's like most the just
[03:35:00] of
[03:35:05] it are you so fancy dude I'm in a lab
[03:35:08] coat how how could nobody tell I'm in a
[03:35:10] [ __ ] lab coat do I need to wear
[03:35:14] goggles she has more team than you think
[03:35:16] though like her main team's mono pyro
[03:35:18] well mono buron whatever but
[03:35:20] like because buron is pretty Flex like
[03:35:24] it's not a good reaction but it's not
[03:35:25] hard to like trigger a viron so you can
[03:35:27] kind of fit it into a lot of
[03:35:41] teams maybe if you weren't naked
[03:35:43] underneath okay well are you supposed to
[03:35:45] wear clothes
[03:35:49] under okay sorry I don't know man I have
[03:35:52] I I don't know I haven't been to a lab
[03:35:55] wait my battle pass is like level 10
[03:35:56] yours is 40 am I cooked I have 20
[03:36:11] days wait so
[03:36:13] chat okay hear me out so Emily okay hear
[03:36:17] me
[03:36:18] out do you just never press your skill
[03:36:21] outside of the first time you press it
[03:36:23] like if okay let's say you're fighting
[03:36:24] an enemy for 26
[03:36:26] rotations you start with either EQ or
[03:36:28] just Q it doesn't really
[03:36:31] matter and then you just never press e
[03:36:34] again you just [ __ ] swap and you
[03:36:37] q and then you swap and you q and then
[03:36:39] you swap and you Q
[03:36:54] skill point
[03:36:58] positive cuz if you if you e you lose
[03:37:01] your your existing ease level it resets
[03:37:03] to level one I
[03:37:06] think and if you're bursting every other
[03:37:09] rotation then sure you would have to
[03:37:12] e but that's another reason why
[03:37:16] kind of like bursting
[03:37:34] more then here you just
[03:37:44] like kitty
[03:37:48] here if I eat nothing happens
[03:37:50] right
[03:37:58] yeah uh Shan's weapon is like her best
[03:38:01] outside of her
[03:38:08] signature any basically any five star
[03:38:10] stattic is pretty good on her though can
[03:38:12] we Chase she's dendro Oz slow
[03:38:17] I don't like the way you type that
[03:38:21] low what's up
[03:38:28] shirro but also yeah like I I kind of
[03:38:31] like Shen's signature weapon is [ __ ]
[03:38:34] fa Lance so you probably shouldn't have
[03:38:36] calamity quer
[03:38:53] H how much er do you need on her it
[03:38:56] ranges from [ __ ] zero to 200 it it I
[03:38:59] hate
[03:39:01] ER I hate ER I wish ER didn't exist and
[03:39:04] we all [ __ ] suffered I said it I'm
[03:39:06] sorry I wish ER wasn't a stat and we all
[03:39:09] [ __ ] struggled to get our purse back
[03:39:19] actually no I wish ER wasn't a stat but
[03:39:21] our and our burst just had a cool down
[03:39:24] [ __ ] it you just get it back after 20
[03:39:26] seconds
[03:39:54] that's called a skill okay give her two
[03:39:57] skills I'm not on Hotel wear also You
[03:40:00] misspelled where your own hotel were
[03:40:18] h
[03:41:09] okay sorry I don't know what the
[03:41:12] [ __ ] what if I eat all your food
[03:41:25] sorry uh wait let me try something
[03:41:27] really quick so you should be able in
[03:41:30] theory but that's just a game theory you
[03:41:32] should be able to
[03:41:35] run uh Mari Shi on basically any like
[03:41:41] Melee
[03:41:43] carry okay I'm not going to use Grizzly
[03:41:46] e but let me make
[03:41:59] sure like our
[03:42:11] HP actually not going down against these
[03:42:13] guys except when we get
[03:42:25] hit I know against like small enemies
[03:42:28] wait let me let me try again or let
[03:42:37] me [ __ ] I have to go to this menu let me
[03:42:40] try another
[03:42:43] floor yeah you can use Golden troop it's
[03:42:45] fine it's like her third
[03:42:47] best it's
[03:42:51] okay they're hot boxes okay please never
[03:42:54] call it that again but yeah I I know
[03:42:56] what you're
[03:42:57] saying like against these enemies I'm
[03:43:00] pretty sure it works minus 6 Z
[03:43:09] 2
[03:43:13] Z Prospect Spector drill is good if you
[03:43:15] have a team wi
[03:43:23] healer
[03:43:26] wait yeah well I need to I should put
[03:43:29] Kazo in this team I need to group these
[03:43:38] [ __ ] like my HP should be if I
[03:43:40] stay close to like this
[03:43:42] guy yeah well
[03:43:46] what about this
[03:43:53] guy
[03:44:03] yeah okay so it works against these guys
[03:44:05] your HP is taking down so you can run
[03:44:07] Mari I don't know
[03:44:09] about the floor 12 dudes it didn't look
[03:44:11] like you could though
[03:44:25] let me get to another wave
[03:44:52] let me kill these
[03:45:01] guys what a run
[03:45:06] guard n not really yeah it doesn't work
[03:45:08] against a run guard cuz you probably
[03:45:09] have to [ __ ] jump to get
[03:45:13] burned no you can't even jump into
[03:45:17] it their [ __ ] hit boxes probably or
[03:45:20] their whatever their core whatever the
[03:45:22] [ __ ] it's called is too
[03:45:35] high yeah yeah it works against some
[03:45:38] enemies not every enemy so okay I
[03:45:40] probably wouldn't do
[03:45:41] it noted let me write that down
[03:45:55] like against so against some enemies
[03:45:57] like air fryer literally there's one
[03:45:59] Abyss where air fryer was literally like
[03:46:01] it would you would effectively kill
[03:46:04] yourself within like two seconds cuz
[03:46:06] there's like 20 enemies you swirl them
[03:46:07] together they're all burning you just
[03:46:09] die but against some enemies you don't
[03:46:11] take burning damage
[03:46:15] like yeah so I guess it just
[03:46:27] depends like against these guys you do
[03:46:33] this you're [ __ ]
[03:46:42] dead like M I should say would work here
[03:46:49] I don't want to kill them but okay well
[03:46:51] they're [ __ ] dead but okay wait let
[03:46:53] me rethink my strategy
[03:46:59] this like see we took damage without
[03:47:01] them hitting us but wait let me wait
[03:47:03] wait wait wait let me okay yeah that we
[03:47:04] have too much [ __ ]
[03:47:11] artifacts actually we didn't even take
[03:47:13] damage there
[03:47:15] yeah I wouldn't do
[03:47:28] it burning damage reduction yeah but
[03:47:30] like damage reduction doesn't matter
[03:47:32] like it's good but if you were to take
[03:47:35] the point is just taking damage doesn't
[03:47:36] matter how much you
[03:47:40] take open world did be
[03:47:43] stronger yeah yeah that's
[03:47:46] true all right what about a Vermilion
[03:47:59] [Music]
[03:48:12] run sorry
[03:48:37] wait one sec
[03:49:13] chatting y
[03:49:18] [Music]
[03:49:21] what I have no energy what the
[03:49:23] [ __ ] what the [ __ ] am I
[03:49:35] doing [ __ ] it Emily time
[03:49:46] yo Chad do you think he's still here if
[03:49:48] he's not here he won't know what I spent
[03:49:50] it on but if he's here then
[03:50:02] we're okay I think the coast is clear do
[03:50:05] it then give a
[03:50:07] welin dude stop pigging him okay let me
[03:50:11] see let me see has he farmed Vermillion
[03:50:13] before
[03:50:18] wait he actually
[03:50:23] hasn't
[03:50:33] bro there's only three Vermilion and
[03:50:35] it's cuz I claimed earlier oh no wait he
[03:50:37] has one wait C never
[03:50:40] mind what about Echo
[03:50:46] I mean it's only one of each
[03:50:50] piece oh could have been strong actually
[03:50:52] it could have been the abyss boxes
[03:50:53] you're
[03:50:56] right a
[03:50:58] [ __ ] wait let me check you have the full
[03:51:01] set in your data
[03:51:10] Bank you do you don't have ocean you
[03:51:14] class or
[03:51:17] husk also no flop or
[03:51:21] DPC
[03:51:28] respectable wait the
[03:51:32] [ __ ] maybe this is cuz you farmed a
[03:51:34] blast before it came out but you don't
[03:51:37] even have the four stars unless you
[03:51:39] straw MOX it but there's no way cuz you
[03:51:41] probably I guess you found it before it
[03:51:43] came out
[03:51:49] cuz you also have Blood Stained for Ula
[03:51:50] so there's no way you would strong box
[03:51:52] both Blood Stained and no blast you you
[03:51:54] wouldn't do that there's just no
[03:51:59] way cuz like at that point you would
[03:52:01] just straw box pale flame like why would
[03:52:02] you go for blood stain so they probably
[03:52:04] I assume you was just
[03:52:07] before like you farmed a blast in 1.0
[03:52:09] and then whenever the data Bank thing
[03:52:11] came out you were out of fourstar pieces
[03:52:12] cuz you deleted them all but I don't
[03:52:13] know if it works
[03:52:21] retroactively anyways
[03:52:56] okay uh I'm probably going to get more
[03:52:59] footage and test some stuff off stream
[03:53:02] that's like a bit more like I have to
[03:53:04] like slow motion and watch it back um
[03:53:08] but let me say
[03:53:11] this I'm going to do another stream with
[03:53:13] Emily on my main account around na
[03:53:16] release probably later cuz I want to get
[03:53:17] the Guide out first so it'll either be
[03:53:18] later tonight or tomorrow morning um the
[03:53:22] guide should be out today though near
[03:53:23] the
[03:53:25] end I personally I like Emily quite a
[03:53:29] bit but I think she's mostly a luxury
[03:53:32] like you don't need her at all but I
[03:53:34] think she's pretty strong uh for burning
[03:53:39] now burning as a reaction [ __ ] sucks
[03:53:41] but the teams where you can play burning
[03:53:44] are pretty good like You' add her to
[03:53:45] like a mono Pyro Team with like arino
[03:53:47] orini you could add her to like finina
[03:53:50] forward Vape she's one of nevet not net
[03:53:53] well she's pretty good with nevet
[03:53:54] actually she's actually good with
[03:53:55] nevette I just I'm not exactly sure how
[03:53:57] good but I'm pretty sure as the dendr
[03:53:59] slot she's a really good one however
[03:54:01] she's in either Net's best team or like
[03:54:04] why do I keep saying nevet she's in
[03:54:06] either rli's best team or his second
[03:54:07] best team which is pretty good and then
[03:54:10] she's also uh viable in over
[03:54:14] in quick burn but I'm not sure how good
[03:54:16] quick bur is like I it's good enough but
[03:54:20] I'm not exactly sure like how good it is
[03:54:23] like it's okay
[03:54:28] um
[03:54:34] yeah she's not a Nita substitute but she
[03:54:37] does things Nita does things she can't
[03:54:40] do but she does things
[03:54:42] Nita kind of can't do either like I'm
[03:54:44] not playing Nikita with arino ever I'm
[03:54:46] not playing Nikita with [ __ ] like
[03:54:48] Nita's much better at applying a lot of
[03:54:51] dendro and giving em her personal damage
[03:54:54] is like Nita's personal damage is decent
[03:54:56] but especially in like a quick and team
[03:54:59] um and for like you know if you're
[03:55:00] playing like hyper bloom or buron like
[03:55:02] you want more d drop
[03:55:05] but uh Emily's personal damage is really
[03:55:07] good that's like what she has going for
[03:55:10] her
[03:55:11] so and she doesn't apply she doesn't
[03:55:14] that much dendro
[03:55:16] though uh so what Emily has going for
[03:55:19] her is in teams
[03:55:22] where maybe you can't benefit from like
[03:55:24] Nita's em for example like mono pyro
[03:55:28] having Emily there for good personal
[03:55:30] damage is like better and then for other
[03:55:33] teams where oh same with like nlet like
[03:55:37] I'd much rather use Emily uh rizle is a
[03:55:40] bit
[03:55:41] different because like he technically
[03:55:43] can use am but Emily just does a lot of
[03:55:46] personal damage in that
[03:55:49] team
[03:55:55] um
[03:55:59] yeah yeah she's not bad for multi-wave
[03:56:02] either cuz this thing lasts basically
[03:56:04] forever like it has over 100% off time
[03:56:06] and it also has really long
[03:56:08] range like it'll attack enemies I don't
[03:56:11] know the exact range but like it should
[03:56:12] hit enemies even like here so like it
[03:56:17] yeah it's not too annoying in that
[03:56:39] regard no I value yolon higher yon's
[03:56:41] pretty [ __ ] broken but I mean
[03:56:45] Emily Emily's pretty good like you don't
[03:56:47] need her but she's pretty
[03:56:49] good but also like it's kind of hard to
[03:56:52] tell cuz Nan's coming in like [ __ ] 3
[03:56:55] weeks
[03:57:00] so yeah
[03:57:36] or she gets better in nline she probably
[03:57:39] will most pre- region characters get
[03:57:42] better and then also like some like n
[03:57:44] got a lot
[03:57:45] better and then like I assume she will
[03:57:48] get better that all sides Point towards
[03:57:51] her getting better however even right
[03:57:54] now I I okay I don't know how to say my
[03:57:57] thoughts but like I don't feel bad
[03:57:58] recommending her cuz I think she's good
[03:58:00] but I don't think you need her like
[03:58:01] she's pretty like if you like her and
[03:58:04] her teams she's very solid in them and
[03:58:06] she enables teams and a reaction that
[03:58:09] otherwise is kind of
[03:58:11] whatever however she's like replacing
[03:58:14] ible like you you're not going to play
[03:58:15] burning without her but you could play
[03:58:17] arino with like [ __ ] yolon or you
[03:58:18] could play like nevet with Buu or you
[03:58:20] could play rly with like Shena like it's
[03:58:23] not
[03:58:24] like it's not like she's irreplaceable
[03:58:27] in her
[03:58:29] teams but if you like her she's
[03:58:31] definitely good
[03:58:37] enough or finina for the rizzly team too
[03:58:40] like
[03:58:44] like on my account I'd rather have like
[03:58:45] a [ __ ] yolan that I could use in
[03:58:47] literally every team but once you start
[03:58:50] having the like core characters I feel
[03:58:52] like you can kind of pick the characters
[03:58:53] you like if they're like obviously how
[03:58:55] good they are varies but like Emily is
[03:58:57] definitely good
[03:58:59] enough like I don't think she's like I'm
[03:59:02] kind of under selling her like I think
[03:59:03] she's very strong is my point like I
[03:59:05] don't think
[03:59:06] she's I think she's very strong but
[03:59:09] she's also very much replaceable
[03:59:18] yeah cuz her scaling is actually good
[03:59:21] like the damage she does on her [ __ ]
[03:59:24] Talent just random like passively
[03:59:26] without you [ __ ] touching her and
[03:59:28] from her burst and from her skill is
[03:59:30] like actually pretty
[03:59:35] good she died
[03:59:44] oh sorry if you're I don't know what
[03:59:46] [ __ ] res food I just
[03:59:48] used she's not that Niche either cuz she
[03:59:51] has like a [ __ ] ton of teams you can
[03:59:52] play her in but she's niche in the sense
[03:59:54] of
[03:59:59] like I would like I don't know an Nish
[04:00:02] isn't the right
[04:00:05] word anyways okay I'm going to end I'm
[04:00:07] going to do a bit more testing off
[04:00:08] stream so I'm going to yoink your
