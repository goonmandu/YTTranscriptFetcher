[00:11:35] Costco with my dad uh that's it though I
[00:11:38] well I played some W like I I was
[00:11:40] playing a bit off stream I did some
[00:11:42] quests some boring quests we're going to
[00:11:43] have to do the main story Quest but I
[00:11:44] was doing like the filler ones like the
[00:11:46] event stuff uh we're going to do this
[00:11:47] one too but it doesn't matter anyways
[00:11:53] uh
[00:11:55] yeah so
[00:11:58] anyways I'm
[00:12:01] um a lot of stuff to talk about
[00:12:06] also this is not the promised held and
[00:12:08] ring stream I think I'm going to like
[00:12:11] release two videos at once because I'm
[00:12:14] not reading this copy pasta I don't care
[00:12:16] how much you spam it buddy I'm this is
[00:12:18] what the [ __ ] it's not even it doesn't
[00:12:19] even look funny it doesn't even look
[00:12:20] worth my words uh uh yeah the thing is I
[00:12:26] I had two w videos ready for release but
[00:12:28] I needed the first one to come out
[00:12:30] before the second one I need the first
[00:12:32] one to be approved by the sponsor and
[00:12:34] I'm waiting so I'm literally just Perma
[00:12:35] and waiting jail no flame I mean I sent
[00:12:37] it a bit late it is what it is but I'm
[00:12:39] literally waiting so I can't upload so
[00:12:41] it's going to be like a day late so it's
[00:12:42] probably irrelevant but just please
[00:12:44] watch it and be like wow Z thank you
[00:12:46] it's actually useful I promise it's
[00:12:47] useful and I modified I modified it Post
[00:12:49] Release to change some things for the
[00:12:51] like five star to pick thing cuz uh
[00:12:54] calaro got changed and I think lingyang
[00:12:56] is different I mean Verina got buffed
[00:12:58] too but it's not worth mentioning reeno
[00:12:59] was broken before and she's still broken
[00:13:00] it doesn't change anything
[00:13:02] anyways I got to calm down my throat

[00:14:35] honestly maybe
[00:14:41] actually I might I don't know
[00:14:45] maybe I just tried to drink with the cap
[00:14:48] on the
[00:14:51] Capo stalling the daily stalling bro it

[00:15:02] I can stall with alternative
[00:15:05] methods alternative medicine water
[00:15:08] flying that's the [ __ ]
[00:15:12] Ducket anyways um yeah the viewer pull
[00:15:16] video was was like the stream rather was
[00:15:18] fun to do so we'll probably do it
[00:15:21] again that time of the June though is
[00:15:24] kind of busy like it's I'm going to be
[00:15:26] running
[00:15:27] around uh you going to stay awake I'm
[00:15:29] going to try to nap I'm going to do W
[00:15:31] for like four five 6 hours then I'm
[00:15:32] going to try to nap a little bit and
[00:15:33] then genin
[00:15:38] live talk about the Tweet Duality dude
[00:15:40] the Tweet wasn't even Duality it
[00:15:42] literally wasn't even like it wasn't
[00:15:44] Duality at all I was just like dude shut
[00:15:46] the [ __ ] up that's
[00:15:48] all this is Z on low sleep he doesn't
[00:15:50] care Z on low sleep has no
[00:15:53] filter it is what it is
[00:16:05] no it is like it's literally it's I have
[00:16:07] one sentence of thoughts okay one
[00:16:09] sentence if you're a like okay if you're
[00:16:11] like a genin or Star rail or whatever
[00:16:13] player and you're Doom posting wa for no
[00:16:14] reason [ __ ] yourself and if you're the
[00:16:16] opposite and you're Doom posting genon
[00:16:18] all the time even though you quit it 5
[00:16:19] years ago [ __ ] yourself as well but like
[00:16:21] both can be valid I I will when I'm done
[00:16:24] my sponsored streams I will [ __ ] talk
[00:16:25] both genin and waa they're both valid
[00:16:27] I'm just saying it's like the constant
[00:16:29] Doom posting of like you're just like
[00:16:31] any new game that comes out or any
[00:16:33] existing game is just you stop playing
[00:16:34] it you doom post it you keep playing it
[00:16:36] you doom post it but it's different I I
[00:16:39] I just said like I use the word hater
[00:16:41] because in my tweet because being a
[00:16:44] hater of a game you don't play is
[00:16:45] different from playing the game and
[00:16:46] complaining about it because you want it
[00:16:47] to be better that's important don't
[00:16:48] misconstrue my words I'm not going to
[00:16:50] keep talking about it but it's very
[00:16:52] important to understand the difference
[00:16:53] between I quit this game for 5 years and
[00:16:56] I'm just bashing it I mean I bash League
[00:16:57] of Legends and I don't play that game
[00:16:58] anymore but [ __ ] Lee go [ __ ] yourself
[00:17:00] but you know I'm not making [ __ ] six
[00:17:03] videos about it it is what it is 20 20
[00:17:05] tweets about it a day it is what it is
[00:17:07] but you
[00:17:11] know there's between that and still
[00:17:13] playing it or still wanting to play it
[00:17:14] but want to get to be better that's fine
[00:17:16] that's actually encouraged what up Jake
[00:17:19] Doom kuming
[00:17:31] Jake bench paper Lily wait have you
[00:17:33] still not played that I've seen it like
[00:17:35] eight of your
[00:17:43] titles no one who plays League likes it
[00:17:46] dude what's a successful game what's a
[00:17:49] successful game that's not like
[00:17:51] um that's not uh like single player one
[00:17:55] time clear game like Elder ring like
[00:17:57] what's a successful
[00:17:59] I don't know what the word is like like
[00:18:00] non-stop like playable game that the
[00:18:03] player base constantly
[00:18:07] likes like like Ellen ring and like
[00:18:10] Skyrim and like God of War like those
[00:18:11] games are great but I feel like they're
[00:18:12] not like I don't know what the word of
[00:18:14] game I'm looking for they're not like
[00:18:17] the I don't know like those feel like
[00:18:20] real AAA like quality
[00:18:24] Games Minecraft wait I thought Minecraft
[00:18:26] were like hate the [ __ ] devs cuz they
[00:18:29] the only time they put like their iy in
[00:18:32] something is for like three pets and
[00:18:33] then they kill two of them when the
[00:18:35] biggest Minecraft Youtuber tells you to
[00:18:36] vote for the ugliest one and then
[00:18:37] everyone votes for the ugliest one and
[00:18:39] then the other two are dead forever I
[00:18:41] don't know maybe they do like I don't
[00:18:42] play Minecraft I don't [ __ ]
[00:18:44] know fortnite did actually get a glow up
[00:18:47] to be honest they they I'm pretty sure
[00:18:50] they've had the best
[00:18:52] collabs like they were kind of a c w for
[00:18:54] a bit but I feel like they're on the
[00:18:55] come up again
[00:19:01] slay the Spire slay the SP is an indie
[00:19:03] game right I feel like indie games do
[00:19:05] like are a lot like I don't know op like
[00:19:09] I feel like I don't know they're like
[00:19:11] they're buffed cuz I feel like they like
[00:19:13] it's like a passion
[00:19:18] project Hearthstone shut the [ __ ] up
[00:19:21] Hearthstone players don't like
[00:19:24] Hearthstone trust me a Hearthstone
[00:19:27] player when are we playing fortnite not
[00:19:29] even joking when are we playing valerent
[00:19:31] not even
[00:19:37] joking yeah Rogue likes are pretty like
[00:19:39] that is
[00:19:42] fair that is
[00:19:47] fair wait are you telling me that
[00:19:50] quality goes up when the devs are
[00:19:51] working for passion instead of profit
[00:19:53] okay unironically like genu full honesty
[00:19:57] I do feel like the weathering waves devs
[00:20:00] like maybe I just got propagandized but
[00:20:02] I I do feel like they care about their
[00:20:04] game which is good that's a good
[00:20:07] sign although okay to be fair I think
[00:20:09] most devs care about their games it's
[00:20:11] just like the people above them that are
[00:20:13] either corpa or not like less corpa but
[00:20:16] I don't know I might just be
[00:20:25] marketing just did the pooku true okay
[00:20:27] fighting flying mons who's up fighting
[00:20:30] flying or act like they care okay but

[00:26:55] temple I'm waiting for British accent to

[00:41:41] right now so like that
[00:41:44] counts Nik
[00:41:47] caught AR Knights
[00:41:55] yeah which of these games you still
[00:41:57] actually play to play League of Legends
[00:42:03] e except for w waves how are the oh

[00:42:10] [ __ ] okay dude but like it's my job dude
[00:42:15] you know my brother spends more on me a
[00:42:17] year he spends more on mobile Legends
[00:42:19] bang bang than I do on genin impact and
[00:42:22] star rail probably and star combat I
[00:42:24] don't know I'm not sure if I factor in
[00:42:26] Star rail
[00:42:29] per month um okay realistically I pull
[00:42:32] for each new character there's one genin
[00:42:34] one one star rail one per month
[00:42:36] excluding reruns right unless it's like
[00:42:38] a fourstar but usually it's one
[00:42:40] excluding reruns so it kind of like two
[00:42:43] total it kind of averages to like one
[00:42:45] point something because gen has a lot of
[00:42:47] reruns let's say two two that's let's
[00:42:50] say two to 300
[00:42:53] bucks it's not 500 it's it's oh let's do
[00:42:56] two to no but but you refresh yeah but I
[00:42:59] so the refresh gems I don't count
[00:43:02] because I make that back by playing with
[00:43:04] welin like okay obviously W's five bucks
[00:43:07] but like I feel like all the Primo gems
[00:43:09] I make from everything are factored into
[00:43:11] that and then my money is what goes into
[00:43:12] the five stars does that make sense does
[00:43:14] that make sense does that make sense
[00:43:15] does that make sense no okay next
[00:43:19] page how have you spent per month in the
[00:43:21] past
[00:43:22] year wait is that what I not just did oh

[00:58:55] guess I can super your store
[00:58:57] but track okay let's go here oh yeah
[00:59:00] also I played off stream a little a
[00:59:02] little bit of mining off stream I tried
[00:59:04] to do some random World quests that are
[00:59:07] less enticing and save the cool stuff
[00:59:09] for
[00:59:10] stream uh so a lot of the like exploring
[00:59:14] and boss fighting and Echo farming I've
[00:59:15] been saving for stream and especially
[00:59:18] we're doing Tower rity today I I don't
[00:59:20] want to yell cuz I'm streaming like
[00:59:21] twice today I'm going to be streaming
[00:59:22] for a long time so I have to stay calm
[00:59:23] but we're going to do Tower of adcity
[00:59:24] today that's a promise
[00:59:27] so yeah I've Karo and Encore is that
[00:59:29] good uh yes they're both really good
[00:59:32] DPSS they're kind of redundant because
[00:59:33] they're both DPSS but team building in
[00:59:35] this game is kind
[00:59:36] of like you're going to need a lot of
[00:59:39] teams anyways so like it's
[00:59:43] fine wait let me uh make sure
[00:59:45] everything's cool like my
[00:59:47] settings what's
[00:59:49] up damage I try to play Encore my more
[00:59:53] Tey deals more damage I try to play Calo
[00:59:57] my Morey deals more D I want to play
[01:00:00] giant best team has Morey
[01:00:05] okay wait who's uh oh never mind I was
[01:00:09] going to say who's the Jin but she's the
[01:00:10] [ __ ] five star I don't have I
[01:00:12] remember oh wait I have 20 pulls no I'll
[01:00:14] save them for later we'll do pulls later
[01:00:15] so that like I can I can like I don't
[01:00:17] want to say this word it I can what's
[01:00:20] the word I'm looking for I
[01:00:24] can say something for later also I think
[01:00:28] we're going for Verina I don't really
[01:00:29] like
[01:00:31] her connection error oh all good okay I
[01:00:35] mean maybe I don't know I think she's op
[01:00:37] though maybe I'll just go Encore I think
[01:00:38] enor is my favorite of the ones I don't
[01:00:40] have like if if I had none I'd go calaro
[01:00:43] if not I'd go Vina or enor probably I
[01:00:46] got lingyang
[01:00:48] too good team
[01:00:53] who now I okay I heard the Jeff 7 say
[01:00:56] that you can kind of put random
[01:00:57] characters together and for the most
[01:00:59] part it'll work unless they have like
[01:01:00] turbo negative Synergy with one
[01:01:02] another I
[01:01:05] recommend I don't think you need a
[01:01:07] Healer in this game but I recommend it
[01:01:08] for most like normal content and then
[01:01:11] for some end game if you're dodging well
[01:01:12] you can Ben your healer although
[01:01:14] verina's broken what did you ask you
[01:01:17] said Mori Vina and then Rover SL
[01:01:19] lingyang yes mortify plus Vina plus
[01:01:23] literally any DPS is probably the best
[01:01:24] team in the game
[01:01:26] I might be coping I might be Fields
[01:01:28] crafting but literally mortify Arina and
[01:01:30] then a DPS and you probably have your
[01:01:32] DPS as best team
[01:01:38] allegedly let me go unlock
[01:01:44] this I want I want to play him though
[01:01:46] let me let me bench my healer I don't
[01:01:47] need a Healer cuz uh I played him a bit
[01:01:50] in beta but I haven't played him and on
[01:01:51] like test but I haven't played him much
[01:01:53] um live server
[01:02:02] what does she do hoina everything and
[01:02:05] nothing simultaneously just kidding she
[01:02:07] does everything heals
[01:02:10] you uh gives you Buffs does a bit of
[01:02:13] damage off field followup
[01:02:17] attack and doesn't need much field
[01:02:22] time I I'll I think I'll choose a
[01:02:24] four-star weapon for him I'll level this
[01:02:25] stuff later I don't need to be turbo
[01:02:26] geared right
[01:02:29] now do I have any Echoes on him I think
[01:02:31] I just clicked Auto equip
[01:02:33] right yeah I just clicked Auto equip
[01:02:48] whatever wait what what does my thing oh

[01:04:40] um weapon upgrade boom POG I kind of
[01:04:45] wish I didn't have the weapon like cuz I
[01:04:47] want to be relatable and genuinely I
[01:04:49] would not have swiped for the weapon
[01:04:50] genuinely like I didn't I got it for
[01:04:51] free in like two free pulls is that my
[01:04:54] fault it be honest is it no no it
[01:04:58] isn't it's okay we're we're c0 or s0
[01:05:02] it's wait what are they I thought it was
[01:05:04] s0 in this game but apparently it's like
[01:05:06] resonance something so r0o resonance
[01:05:08] chain
[01:05:10] rc0 rc0
[01:05:14] okay I need to level these I don't have
[01:05:18] enough green
[01:05:21] ones does this guy need the same ones no
[01:05:24] does this guy need the same ones no oh
[01:05:26] he
[01:05:27] does okay Karo
[01:05:39] okay I mean can we wait we can
[01:05:41] technically call it C 0 because it's
[01:05:44] resonance chain so it could be like
[01:05:47] chain zero no it's probably r zero I
[01:05:49] don't know whatever
[01:05:57] should I reroll for enor Verina or is
[01:05:59] calaro the
[01:06:01] best uh well I have a video for
[01:06:04] you no as far as rrolling goes I I don't
[01:06:07] know it depends on your on your patience
[01:06:09] and who you
[01:06:10] like I I in my head calaro and enor are
[01:06:14] the
[01:06:18] same wait what is this they have like
[01:06:21] the same rol so you just pick the one
[01:06:22] you like more
[01:06:29] but
[01:06:30] yeah they're ready resonator so you
[01:06:33] could just say it's their chain
[01:06:36] true

[01:09:25] him clunky in the beta in live server I
[01:09:28] feel like he's better like he feels
[01:09:30] better but I really still don't know if
[01:09:32] it's like just me or if he actually got
[01:09:34] like

[01:19:21] so okay just white on the third one I
[01:19:23] got it white on the third one wait
[01:19:25] there's more than three oh never mind
[01:19:28] it's fine middle row is
[01:19:30] white wait can I just go
[01:19:35] through no I can't okay so middle wait
[01:19:38] what does activate the device
[01:19:41] do wait why can't I rotate oh to see
[01:19:45] more of it what the
[01:19:51] [ __ ] oh
[01:19:53] no oh I have to mimic the mimic okay so
[01:19:57] left was a
[01:19:59] [Music]
[01:20:02] a wait okay let me just figure out what
[01:20:04] this is
[01:20:09] oh wait one
[01:20:15] second okay never mind I'm lost again
[01:20:23] wait okay I can change them cool let me
[01:20:25] let me revert it to what it was so I
[01:20:28] could make this one that color and then
[01:20:30] this one that color wait wait let me
[01:20:32] make sure I
[01:20:33] understand so white
[01:20:36] black oh does this mimic this wait let
[01:20:38] me see do any of these
[01:20:40] mimic no I don't think they do
[01:20:43] right no okay so that one looks like
[01:20:48] that which
[01:20:51] means that why are those inverted
[01:21:03] carefully observe the marks on the wall
[01:21:04] when all patterns come together the
[01:21:06] answer is right in front of
[01:21:10] you wishing I was the VOD dude chill I'm
[01:21:15] almost done I'm almost done I didn't
[01:21:16] know this was
[01:21:24] the fact that there's a reset patterns
[01:21:26] button implies that I can change the
[01:21:29] patterns
[01:21:31] right so that implies that what I do
[01:21:33] here changes
[01:21:36] something but I'm not exactly sure what
[01:21:38] let me make it all white so I can
[01:21:50] see okay let me figure let me c let me
[01:21:52] cook start the timer 5 minutes on the
[01:21:54] clock
[01:21:56] none of them are
[01:21:59] white
[01:22:00] [ __ ]
[01:22:11] um okay let me mimic one of them let me
[01:22:14] mimic one of them we we'll match the
[01:22:16] this one we'll match this one so we'll
[01:22:18] make it black here black here black here
[01:22:23] black here and then I messed
[01:22:26] up black here and then
[01:22:31] here
[01:22:34] here here I missed I missed I missed
[01:22:38] don't Ty ien I
[01:22:41] missed okay we just mimicked the top one
[01:22:43] does that do literally
[01:22:51] anything wasn't that the default yo but
[01:22:54] I don't know which one I'm supposed to
[01:22:55] do cuz there's
[01:22:57] three okay let me do the left
[01:23:00] one let me do the left one let me do the
[01:23:02] left one so all black at the
[01:23:06] bottom and then all white except half
[01:23:09] white at the top half white uh here and
[01:23:13] then boom
[01:23:17] right so I mimick that one did that do
[01:23:19] anything no it
[01:23:21] didn't I feel like there's something
[01:23:23] else to this that I'm not understanding
[01:23:25] is there a
[01:23:32] [Music]
[01:23:35] tutorial okay it's definitely a rotate I
[01:23:37] need to understand how this rotate thing
[01:23:39] I don't get how this affects a puzzle
[01:23:40] yet I haven't figured it
[01:23:49] out
[01:23:53] ah superpose
[01:24:00] them oh
[01:24:15] maybe okay let me try something so let's
[01:24:21] say like some of them are always the
[01:24:24] same color on all three right like
[01:24:25] bottom right is always
[01:24:28] black bottom left is always black bottom
[01:24:31] middle
[01:24:32] is
[01:24:41] flex Harmon in the form there's inherent
[01:24:43] meaning a harmonous Unity carefully
[01:24:45] observe the marks on the wall when all
[01:24:46] patterns come together what does that
[01:24:49] mean I have to stack them maybe what
[01:24:53] happens if I stack White on black on
[01:24:55] black does that mean black takes
[01:24:56] priority cuz there's two like 2
[01:25:01] V1 it's a 1
[01:25:06] v20 black black
[01:25:10] white white
[01:25:15] white merge all the white
[01:25:18] marks
[01:25:19] oh oh maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe
[01:25:26] maybe I'm sorry I said we'll do com it's
[01:25:29] still a fun puzzle okay but like chill
[01:25:31] just chill I'm I'm not I'm not dumb I
[01:25:33] promise oh I just plunged two at
[01:25:47] once okay that's good rewards I was
[01:25:50] overcooking honestly I was over
[01:25:51] complicating it cuz like I had it I just
[01:25:53] wasn't sure if I needed to like do all
[01:25:55] the whites or something different but it
[01:25:56] was just do all the wh okay I got it I
[01:25:58] got it cuz you super impose like all the
[01:26:01] all the all the
[01:26:04] yeah but that's also like a new game
[01:26:06] thing like now it's going to be second
[01:26:07] nature to me cuz like I wasn't sure like
[01:26:09] like like like like like like if if it
[01:26:11] was like okay you put all the like ones
[01:26:13] of the same color together or if it was
[01:26:15] like if you do white or black or if you
[01:26:16] do like okay well if there's two white
[01:26:18] one black then you do the white not the
[01:26:19] black or the black not the white I don't
[01:26:21] know okay but I figured it out well we
[01:26:22] figur it out wow smiley face Thanks

[03:44:24] honestly I mean Rover spectro yeah it
[03:44:27] sucks
[03:44:42] [Music]
[03:45:02] sorry do you ever stop no
[03:45:15] yeah I don't know I enjoy the combat a
[03:45:16] lot but the reality like is my opinion
[03:45:19] kind of doesn't matter because like I
[03:45:21] like the game and it's fun but I'm only
[03:45:22] going to like really like it if you guys
[03:45:25] like it cuz if you guys don't [ __ ]
[03:45:26] like the game then like why would I play
[03:45:27] it so I don't really care about my
[03:45:30] opinion but I do enjoy it like I I'm
[03:45:32] having fun I think the combat's really
[03:45:33] cool and the exploration is really cool
[03:45:35] the we're not hashtag ad right now well
[03:45:37] it's in the title but like the sponsor
[03:45:38] segment's done so I like I'm I'm you
[03:45:39] know um yeah
[03:45:46] I mean I am mashing through the quests
[03:45:48] admittedly so that part I'm kind of like
[03:45:49] whatever on but uh like this part I'm
[03:45:54] enjoying quite a
[03:46:09] lot I yeah I I think they definitely
[03:46:12] could have done a better like
[03:46:15] I've seen like posts about how they
[03:46:17] could have done a better job at like
[03:46:18] introducing the story cuz it is very
[03:46:20] like you're overloaded with [ __ ] at the
[03:46:22] start um but like the reason I say like
[03:46:26] my opinion doesn't matters like I know
[03:46:27] it like kind of does but like per like
[03:46:30] I'm not a story player and like most
[03:46:32] people are so like genjin story I think
[03:46:34] is really good same with star rail but
[03:46:37] like even if it wasn't I would like the
[03:46:39] game cuz like I I care about it but I
[03:46:42] don't care as much as most people do
[03:46:48] same with this like I care more about
[03:46:50] the like how the combat feels a lot more
[03:46:52] than the average player whereas I care
[03:46:54] about how the story feels a lot less
[03:46:56] than the average player because like
[03:46:59] even like even in games where the story
[03:47:02] is good sometimes I'm mashing my space
[03:47:04] bar on mute like genuinely like whatever
[03:47:06] like who
[03:47:09] cares so
[03:47:13] yeah so like
[03:47:26] yeah is this pay to win I don't think so
[03:47:28] I mean it's a gacha game so you can
[03:47:30] always just swipe to be better but like
[03:47:32] pay to win implies you need to spend
[03:47:34] money to clear [ __ ] I don't think you do
[03:47:35] but I haven't got into like the end game
[03:47:37] yet so I don't know but I don't from
[03:47:39] what I've heard I don't think
[03:47:41] so but it's also gotcha so you know be
[03:47:44] mindful of that
[03:47:45] drink I should call her what does that
[03:47:48] have to do with anything no you
[03:47:55] shouldn't okay wait what is this again I
[03:47:58] I feel like I I've done this but I don't
[03:47:59] remember
[03:48:12] what

[03:48:18] them that one looked like it was

[03:53:13] telling you but now the thing is if my
[03:53:16] video was on time people were like damn
[03:53:17] you're so smart but now I assume
[03:53:19] everyone's already talked about it so
[03:53:20] people going to watch my video like oh
[03:53:21] everyone knows this already [ __ ] you
[03:53:24] chatter I fictional chatter I just made
[03:53:26] up to get mad at because this is how I
[03:53:28] make content [ __ ]
[03:53:33] you my problem with the community based
[03:53:35] on a fictional person I just made up
[03:53:37] that's not real [ __ ]
[03:53:43] you no but
[03:53:46] um okay I also was cooking though this
[03:53:48] was actually my cooking maybe 20 other
[03:53:51] people talked about it but I was
[03:53:52] literally cooking I was cooking I was
[03:53:54] like I I I cooked dude Yan Ching
[03:53:58] lyone okay the three star lyone that
[03:54:01] gives speed is probably better
[03:54:05] but the fourstar Yang King lyone what is
[03:54:08] it called what is it called anyone know
[03:54:10] the fourstar lon that has yaning on it

[03:54:16] survey says River Flows In
[03:54:20] Spring if you're running a shielder
[03:54:23] namely
[03:54:28] aanin this thing gives you speed eight
[03:54:30] to I think it skills to 12% and damage
[03:54:34] so you think it sucks you can actually
[03:54:37] use it anyways I'll upload when I
[03:54:41] upload but yeah because he only cares
[03:54:44] about two stats so yeah yeah yeah yeah
[03:54:48] yeah although lowkey I regret saying I
[03:54:51] didn't upload the video yet but I regret
[03:54:53] saying that
[03:54:54] like I basically said main stats don't
[03:54:56] matter but I kind of like said if you're
[03:54:58] like mid maxing crits better than HP but
[03:55:01] I honestly think if you're M maxing like
[03:55:03] it doesn't it still doesn't matter like
[03:55:04] you just filter by sub stats okay I'm
[03:55:06] going to stop talking let's watch the

[04:05:12] yeah up I have a lot of stuff up it I'm
[04:05:14] lagging a little bit let me fix it bra
[04:05:17] maybe you can roll some brain cells okay
[04:05:19] you're you're real funny Buster real fun
[04:05:23] real funny
[04:05:28] pal it means goodbye in
[04:05:31] British dude
[04:05:36] British you know I have a child you know
[04:05:38] how like okay this is going to sound
[04:05:40] [ __ ] up you know how like sometimes
[04:05:42] you'll have an embarrassing moment and
[04:05:43] then you'll be like walking down the
[04:05:44] road and then and you like remember it
[04:05:46] and then you try to like shun it out of
[04:05:48] your memory or it comes out when you're
[04:05:49] like taking a shower and you're like God
[04:05:50] I hope everyone else didn't remember
[04:05:52] that type of thing and like and then you
[04:05:53] reassure yourself you're like dude
[04:05:54] probably no one remembered it cuz like
[04:05:56] I'm not the main character and like I
[04:05:57] remember it so everyone else is going to
[04:05:58] forget like everyone else going to
[04:05:59] forget right okay I remember this is
[04:06:01] going to like kind of disprove that
[04:06:04] because I vividly remember in like
[04:06:06] second grade or some no like fourth
[04:06:08] grade or some [ __ ] one kid in our class
[04:06:11] he you know he he was n't the brightest
[04:06:14] like he was a nice dude but he was kind
[04:06:16] of Pega he was like the teacher wanted
[04:06:19] us to like go up this like my only
[04:06:20] memory from like fourth grade or
[04:06:22] whatever and he the only and okay the
[04:06:25] teacher asked us to like go up and like
[04:06:27] present like one or two things and among
[04:06:29] those things among us was to say like
[04:06:32] what uh language we would like to learn
[04:06:34] or be interested in learning when we
[04:06:36] grow up and he said British and then
[04:06:38] everyone laughed and like look look you
[04:06:41] know that's I feel bad I don't know if I
[04:06:44] laughed I don't remember that part I
[04:06:45] would like to hope I didn't I kind of
[04:06:47] feel bad you know just like I was a kid
[04:06:49] uh but I definitely still remember that
[04:06:53] which is [ __ ] because that means that
[04:06:54] people might still remember my most
[04:06:56] embarrassing moments so yeah
[04:07:00] aware dude he was like I would love to
[04:07:02] learn British I'm like
[04:07:07] bro that's like my only memory of
[04:07:09] primary school
[04:07:15] low key
[04:07:19] deserved right let me get some
[04:07:24] stamina okay
[04:07:34] [Music]
[04:07:41] oops all right PG
[04:08:00] Castle your plunge yeah you weren't
[04:08:02] there for the the the extra highte I
[04:08:04] taught
[04:08:06] yesterday look at this look at this jump
[04:08:08] plunge cancel plunge and then you
[04:08:10] grapple you cancel it again look at how
[04:08:11] high you went you can't cancel the
[04:08:12] second Plunge
[04:08:14] normally but you can cancel it with your
[04:08:16] grapple so you can go really
[04:08:22] high yeah I'm a
[04:08:27] gamer how' you
[04:08:30] tell how do you dash mid there you press
[04:08:33] the dash
[04:08:36] button you can also do back flips wait
[04:08:38] how do you do that it's uh
[04:08:41] yeah oh [ __ ] I suck at
[04:08:48] it
[04:08:56] [ __ ] all right let's go
[04:09:01] do should probably fight bosses get
[04:09:03] Echoes and [ __ ] let's go get an
[04:09:11] echo echo of w does a back flip wait do
[04:09:13] you not need to hold
[04:09:15] s wait oh you
[04:09:19] don't that's like almost
[04:09:20] counterintuitive but it makes
[04:09:34] sense it's called a neutral
[04:09:41] Dodge okay
[04:09:44] uh I can't think of anything funny to
[04:09:47] say good to know wait where am I going
[04:09:52] there
[04:10:09] okay oh my God it's the [ __ ] [ __ ] we
[04:10:12] fought in the
[04:10:19] I forgot we fought this guy in the house
[04:10:21] you just take the
[04:10:26] elevator warning Mech
[04:10:29] Abomination warning okay I literally
[04:10:31] took damage even though they gave me a
[04:10:33] big ass warning why would he damage me
[04:10:35] when he falls from the sky does that
[04:10:36] make sense not really not
[04:10:39] really and then I take damage on the
[04:10:41] swap
[04:10:42] okay I won't take damage anymore I'm
[04:10:44] locked in VCT lock
[04:10:46] in what is he doing he charged okay no
[04:10:49] more damage no more
[04:10:57] damage is he know weakness
[04:10:59] broken hello
[04:11:15] I'm dead I'm
[04:11:21] dead well I canceled my animation I
[04:11:23] don't know what
[04:11:26] [Music]
[04:11:37] happened can I get my health
[04:11:40] Mack I don't need it ni nice easy Echo
[04:11:45] comat looks fun it is it is it is it
[04:11:50] is definitely the best part of this game
[04:11:53] let's go get the morning
[04:11:57] aches hey brother you get a you get uh
[04:12:01] any morning
[04:12:02] aches yeah all the time
[04:12:05] brother my back hurts in the morning I'm
[04:12:09] sorry I'm sorry
[04:12:17] Perma waa question mark oh well I don't
[04:12:19] have a choice it killed genin it's the
[04:12:21] genin killer I can't play genin ever
[04:12:24] again but I don't know I mean I like it
[04:12:26] we'll see we'll see if you guys like it
[04:12:27] I'll still stream if you don't like it I
[04:12:28] won't so we'll see I'm enjoying
[04:12:41] it you
[04:12:51] wee pogo stick we we okay why they have
[04:12:56] to Nerf
[04:13:10] that trust Don't Mind If I Do
[04:13:16] [ __ ] I canceled it
[04:13:31] wrong dude I have no stamina like how do
[04:13:33] you want me to dodge that minus one
[04:13:37] ultimate what I think is your Echoes
[04:13:39] they're not leveled except for one cuz
[04:13:40] it's not worth leveling your Echoes
[04:13:42] early game for the most part like okay
[04:13:44] if you want to be fully optimal you skip
[04:13:46] a lot of the permanent content that's
[04:13:48] gated behind certain like Echoes and
[04:13:50] then you just do all the like you grind
[04:13:52] Echoes really fast so you can get four
[04:13:53] and five star ones and then you can
[04:13:54] start leveling them however one you have
[04:13:56] to play the game an absurd amount for
[04:13:58] that to be like the case uh and two even
[04:14:00] though permanent content is permanent
[04:14:02] forever some of the permanent some of
[04:14:03] the the permanent content gives you a
[04:14:05] lot of XP notably this which helps you
[04:14:07] progress faster so like leveling Echo is
[04:14:09] realistically worth it for this but you
[04:14:11] can do lower level ones cuz they cost
[04:14:12] less but I don't know I'm going to I'm
[04:14:14] going to do this right now actually two
[04:14:14] and three Echoes level up five Echoes
[04:14:19] okay like it's okay if you're stuck at
[04:14:21] like Tower floor two or like four or
[04:14:23] whatever because you don't want to level
[04:14:24] your Echoes more cuz you could just do
[04:14:26] it in like when you're stronger cuz it's
[04:14:29] more efficient to level a five like a
[04:14:30] golden Echo than a blue Echo but you
[04:14:33] also don't want to just hold off forever
[04:14:34] and then never play and because you suck
[04:14:36] and then you're not grinding enough so
[04:14:37] like you know just don't be afraid to
[04:14:39] spend resources but um
[04:14:44] you
[04:14:46] know which one did you choose from the
[04:14:48] event don't talk to me I [ __ ]
[04:14:52] you I just chose a random one cuz I
[04:14:54] thought I would never I it is what it
[04:14:58] is um this is actually attack with
[04:15:00] attack and
[04:15:02] attack which means and the echo skill
[04:15:04] increases attack so it's pretty I could
[04:15:07] just level it and then slap it on
[04:15:09] anyone I need to tune three Echoes do I
[04:15:12] have a good fourstar this is spectral
[04:15:13] damage bonus why do I have this equipped
[04:15:16] wait why is this
[04:15:18] equipped oh I cuz I was swapping [ __ ]
[04:15:21] around I
[04:15:25] [Music]
[04:15:32] see okay
[04:15:35] this wait what is happening equip go
[04:15:38] here why can't I click on the
[04:15:44] I just lost it
[04:15:47] now I'll figure it out
[04:15:50] later okay I need to tune three Echoes
[04:15:53] so um do I have a good fourstar one I
[04:15:56] can tune I mean they're all spectro [ __ ]
[04:15:59] it I'll just do a three
[04:16:02] star boom we'll get it to level
[04:16:09] 10 boom
[04:16:15] tune death okay and then we'll tune a GN
[04:16:19] piece cuz he's the character I'm Ming
[04:16:20] anyways do I have a good three
[04:16:22] star um Arrow damage attack HP I
[04:16:27] mean it's not great
[04:16:30] but it's honest
[04:16:34] work could also just do a no I can't
[04:16:37] okay whatever
[04:16:47] tune another
[04:16:48] one death [ __ ] it I'm doing another
[04:16:52] basic attack damage [ __ ]
[04:16:59] you level up oh five Echo not three okay
[04:17:03] let me get another okay let me go kill
[04:17:04] the monkey cuz I might get a good monkey
[04:17:06] oh no but I'm already I have already
[04:17:07] have a monkey equipped okay I just need
[04:17:09] a random Arrow damage whatever
[04:17:19] seems expensive to upgrade stuff yeah it
[04:17:20] is a lot of stuff ISS locked behind
[04:17:22] stamina or like you'll get enough for
[04:17:24] like one character in the story and all
[04:17:25] that and then the others you have to
[04:17:28] like
[04:17:32] grindage what was I trying to do echo
[04:17:34] echo echo echo echo
[04:17:38] [Music]
[04:17:45] I don't have another stat that's useful
[04:17:46] I want [ __ ] glacio damage cuz it
[04:17:48] gives me flat attack there's literally
[04:17:49] nothing else that's good HP HP attack
[04:18:00] HP I'm going to level two stars cuz
[04:18:02] they're cheaper okay
[04:18:20] honestly no I'll level something for
[04:18:21] another character cuz that that piece
[04:18:23] really sucks I could level this but it's
[04:18:25] going to be expensive as [ __ ] but it is
[04:18:28] attack percent on a five star I think
[04:18:31] it's worth leveling like it's a it's a
[04:18:33] it's a golden echo on Fusion damage with
[04:18:35] attack per the HP sucks but it's attack
[04:18:38] percent with Fusion damage it might not
[04:18:40] be bad
[04:18:50] is it expensive to get the
[04:18:52] 10 yeah it's pretty [ __ ]
[04:18:56] expensive I don't
[04:18:58] know it's also a one
[04:19:03] cost yeah it's say I don't think it's
[04:19:05] worth it either I'll level like a random
[04:19:07] two star I I just want a two star for
[04:19:08] Jen cuz he's the
[04:19:10] character I'll level this one [ __ ] it no

[04:32:39] Rea monetized reaction video you're
[04:32:41] right right my fault no I'm not slowing
[04:32:43] it down feel fre to join their Discord
[04:32:44] and follow their Twitter to get the
[04:32:45] latest updates with that in mind let's
[04:32:46] now get into the video starting things
[04:32:48] off as you enter weathering waves you
[04:32:49] may be wondering what to do and how you
[04:32:50] should be progressing the first thing
[04:32:51] you need to know is that in general when
[04:32:52] you can do the main story you should
[04:32:54] focus on it this is because you'll get a
[04:32:55] ton of Union level XP progressing your
[04:32:56] account unlocking new areas and also
[04:32:58] exploring along the way you get a ton of
[04:32:59] resources materials from completing the
[04:33:00] story Quest on top of as mentioned a big
[04:33:02] chunk of XP as you complete main story
[04:33:03] Quest eventually you'll get locked out
[04:33:04] of continuing you'll need to level up to
[04:33:05] unlock the following Quest and at that
[04:33:07] point that's when you can do other
[04:33:08] things among those things include
[04:33:09] exploring around defeating enemies
[04:33:10] opening chests and just doing basically
[04:33:12] everything that you can I highly
[04:33:13] recommend that as you are doing the main
[04:33:14] story Quest as you progressing in the
[04:33:15] game try to pick up any Quest you see
[04:33:16] any side quest or exploration Quest and
[04:33:18] then when you can't progress the main
[04:33:19] story Quest any further that's when I
[04:33:20] recommend going and doing all of these
[04:33:21] other quests do basically anything that
[04:33:22] you can to help progress your account as
[04:33:24] fast as possible okay that kind of was a
[04:33:25] little scuffed cuz it was in YouTube
[04:33:26] Studio after cuz I noticed it was
[04:33:28] repetitive so I did it after to daily
[04:33:31] it's like barely SCU like you can barely
[04:33:32] tell do basically anything that you can
[04:33:35] as fast as possible also be sure to do
[04:33:36] your daily Quests for a bunch of free
[04:33:38] daily rewards that you can get very
[04:33:39] easily additionally on top of just
[04:33:40] collecting what you can opening chests
[04:33:42] basically is very important notably for
[04:33:44] echo echo are the gear of this game the
[04:33:46] artifact equivalent what you're going to
[04:33:47] be equipping on your characters and
[04:33:48] echos are very important now regarding
[04:33:50] Echo something you need to understand is
[04:33:50] that whatever Echo you choose as your
[04:33:52] main Echo that you put in your first
[04:33:53] slot will give you its unique yo this
[04:33:54] Echo is a little Echo something you need
[04:33:56] to understand the SS aren't even good
[04:33:58] but like if I had that Echo you use as
[04:34:00] your main Echo that you put in your
[04:34:01] first slot will give you its unique
[04:34:03] effect these are very important as they
[04:34:04] give you a new ability a new active you
[04:34:05] can use whenever it's up you can spam it
[04:34:06] it doesn't cost anything it usually has
[04:34:07] a really good effect that can also
[04:34:08] synergize well with whatever character
[04:34:10] way too dank okay I'll turn it to one
[04:34:12] .25 these and equip these on all of your
[04:34:14] characters as they work even without
[04:34:15] leveling your Echoes the way to unlock
[04:34:17] Echoes is you defeat an enemy you can
[04:34:18] absorb the Echo and there's a ton of
[04:34:20] different ones that you'll be getting as
[04:34:21] you play the game and fight different
[04:34:22] enemies now what you need to understand
[04:34:23] with echo in particular though is that
[04:34:25] as with other games the higher Rarity
[04:34:26] they are the better they will be the
[04:34:28] more stats substats and overall value
[04:34:30] they will have and so naturally you want
[04:34:31] to try to be getting the highest Rarity
[04:34:32] Echoes as often as possible but how do
[04:34:34] you do that well in weaing waves you
[04:34:36] have a data bank which you should level
[04:34:37] as fast as possible this is something
[04:34:39] that I highly recommend prioritizing
[04:34:40] because the higher level your data dock
[04:34:42] is the higher Rarity Echoes you can get
[04:34:44] there are four different Rarities of
[04:34:45] Echoes In weathering waves green blue
[04:34:47] purple and gold also known as Rank 2 3
[04:34:49] four and five with gold Echoes being the
[04:34:51] best and what you're looking for now in
[04:34:52] order to get these and actually be able
[04:34:53] to start farming them you want your data
[04:34:55] Bank to be level 15 this you can start
[04:34:57] getting these gold Echoes and in order
[04:34:58] to level up your data Bank you want to
[04:34:59] be collecting Echoes every different
[04:35:01] unique Echo you get gives you Data Bank
[04:35:03] XP and additionally you'll get XP for
[04:35:04] each of these Echo you get of a
[04:35:06] different Rarity this means that you
[04:35:07] will get XP from getting a green Echo
[04:35:08] and then getting the same one in blue
[04:35:09] purple and gold all helping you level
[04:35:11] your data the dock which leads me to a
[04:35:13] pretty big tip Farm Echoes as you
[04:35:15] progress claim all of them clear as many
[04:35:16] enemies as you can especially new
[04:35:17] enemies to unlock all of the new Echoes
[04:35:19] and also as you level your data Bank you
[04:35:21] will be wanting to go back and fight
[04:35:22] enemies that you've already cleared Echo
[04:35:24] you've already unlocked just to get the
[04:35:25] higher Rarities even if you're not
[04:35:26] planning on using them to give you Data
[04:35:28] Bank XP while I'm not going to go in
[04:35:29] depth on how every part of the
[04:35:31] echosystem works it's important to
[04:35:32] understand that Echo are important and
[04:35:33] so you should be leveling your data Bank
[04:35:35] claiming the good rewards you get from
[04:35:36] it as well and trying to get level 15 as
[04:35:38] fast as possible just leveling up as
[04:35:39] much as you can by either collecting new
[04:35:41] echo or new Rarity of an echo you've
[04:35:42] already found with that in mind how
[04:35:44] should you be spending your resources
[04:35:45] well this leads us to a big mistake that
[04:35:47] I think you should avoid and the start
[04:35:48] of some more advanced tips that I've
[04:35:49] learned through playing many gacha games
[04:35:51] for many years notably sinking three
[04:35:52] plus years of my life in get an impact
[04:35:54] and this leads me to the first big
[04:35:56] mistake I think you should be avoiding
[04:35:57] which is fck I repeated a sentence
[04:35:58] whatever shut
[04:36:00] up uh I'm not re-exporting for
[04:36:02] that I just said the thing mistake thing
[04:36:04] twice should be leveling the first it's
[04:36:07] fine wait let me relisten let me listen
[04:36:08] does it sound that bad let me listen in
[04:36:09] mind how should you be spending your
[04:36:10] resources well this leads us to a big
[04:36:12] mistake that I think you should avoid
[04:36:13] and the start of some more advanced tips
[04:36:15] that I've learned through playing many
[04:36:16] gacha games for many years notably
[04:36:17] sinking three plus years of my life in
[04:36:18] gen an impact and this leads me to the
[04:36:20] first big mistake I think regarding
[04:36:22] wasting your resources leveling up the
[04:36:23] wrong things and just resource
[04:36:25] management in general first of all
[04:36:26] regarding Echo you shouldn't be leveling
[04:36:28] the first Echoes you're getting
[04:36:29] obviously you're going to get a lot of
[04:36:30] bad Echoes green Echoes blue Echoes
[04:36:31] things that you're not going to be using
[04:36:32] for a long time and so part of rushing
[04:36:34] to a high Data Bank level is starting to
[04:36:36] get these good Echoes that you might be
[04:36:37] using for a long time gold Echoes and
[04:36:39] even purple Echoes will be a lot better
[04:36:40] and more efficient to use before you
[04:36:41] start investing all of your resources
[04:36:43] into maxing out your Echoes now this
[04:36:44] doesn't mean you can't level anything it
[04:36:46] just means that the faster you unlock
[04:36:47] better Echoes the faster you can Farm
[04:36:49] good ones and won't need to waste any
[04:36:50] resources in the bad ones that'll only
[04:36:52] help you for the early game additionally
[04:36:53] as far as account progression goes you
[04:36:55] don't need to optimize every character
[04:36:57] that well just to get through what you
[04:36:58] need to get through as fast as possible
[04:37:00] to start getting for example gold Echoes
[04:37:01] progress through the quest unlock all of
[04:37:03] these important things you're rushing to
[04:37:04] unlock before you actually need to focus
[04:37:05] on leveling all your Echoes and Min
[04:37:07] maxing everything it's much more
[04:37:08] efficient to try to unlock these higher
[04:37:10] Rarity Echoes than to just level all of
[04:37:11] the low Rarity ones that you have clear
[04:37:14] for example floor of a permanent content
[04:37:16] game mode that's going to be there
[04:37:17] forever to go into a bit more detail
[04:37:18] about this though and what you should be
[04:37:19] investing into the first thing that I
[04:37:21] think can make your progression a lot
[04:37:22] harder is if you spread yourself too
[04:37:23] thin and start leveling every character
[04:37:25] that you have or even just too many of
[04:37:26] them the reality is that in the early
[04:37:28] and mid game resources will be scarce
[04:37:30] and so because of this you're going to
[04:37:31] look how to pronounce scar resources my
[04:37:33] personal advice is to focus on one DPS
[04:37:35] character one or two but typically one
[04:37:37] one team that you're going to be using
[04:37:38] before moving on to others now
[04:37:40] eventually in weathering waves you're
[04:37:41] going to need three teams and so even if
[04:37:42] you end up leveling a few characters a
[04:37:43] little bit it's okay but it will always
[04:37:45] be more efficient to have one character
[04:37:46] to carry you one character whose level
[04:37:48] weapon talents and all that are leveled
[04:37:50] effectively as much as you can to really
[04:37:51] carry you through the early and mid game
[04:37:53] without committing too much to too many
[04:37:54] characters and wasting too many
[04:37:55] resources personally I do think that
[04:37:56] because weing waves is a game where you
[04:37:58] are incentivized to swap between
[04:37:59] characters a lot and we'll get into some
[04:38:01] combat tips a bit later there can be
[04:38:02] some benefits to focusing on two
[04:38:03] characters and sort of cycling through
[04:38:04] them using your intro and outro skills
[04:38:06] but for the most part I think you should
[04:38:07] focus on one character primarily and
[04:38:08] then your first team of three characters
[04:38:10] before moving on and spreading yourself
[04:38:11] even more thinly with that in mind
[04:38:13] though I have to say something that I've
[04:38:14] noticed through playing different gacha
[04:38:16] games streaming to a bunch of people and
[04:38:17] getting the same questions over and over
[04:38:18] and well it's true that you should not
[04:38:20] waste your resources obviously right you
[04:38:22] want to be certain of your decisions you
[04:38:23] don't want to level a character then not
[04:38:24] use them I also think that being afraid
[04:38:26] to spend any resource hoarding forever
[04:38:27] not being able to progress and just not
[04:38:29] knowing what to do is almost worse a lot
[04:38:30] of the times because of this just choose
[04:38:32] a character you like and most characters
[04:38:33] in this game can be a DPS unless you're
[04:38:35] purely A Healer like Verina or by who
[04:38:37] can still be good characters but are
[04:38:38] obviously more supports like verina's
[04:38:39] insane but not at healing damage more so
[04:38:41] healing and buffing taking your
[04:38:42] character leveling them up investing
[04:38:43] into them a lot even if you're not sure
[04:38:45] how quote unquote meta they are I don't
[04:38:46] think you should be focusing on tier
[04:38:47] lists day one looking at who the
[04:38:49] absolute strongest unit's going to be as
[04:38:50] even a character like the Rover the main
[04:38:52] character can carry dude I forgot okay
[04:38:54] you guys can't see it but on the test
[04:38:55] server I named my Rover xddddd and Allan
[04:38:58] took a that he took a screenshot [ __ ]
[04:39:00] you I mean that gu that's my all the
[04:39:03] free characters are genuinely pretty
[04:39:04] good you will also be getting a five
[04:39:06] star from the beginner banner and so
[04:39:07] getting a character to invest into
[04:39:08] shouldn't be the hardest thing and so
[04:39:10] don't hoard your resources but also
[04:39:11] don't waste them it can be hard to know
[04:39:12] what to do as it's a new game and there
[04:39:14] are so many different characters you can
[04:39:15] invest into but as I said choose someone
[04:39:16] to carry you a main DPS get them a good
[04:39:18] weapon preferably if you're not sure
[04:39:19] what to use something with attack is
[04:39:20] always good you can use a three star
[04:39:22] weapon just fine you can also refine it
[04:39:23] or upgrade it by chucking multiple
[04:39:24] weapons of the same type into it and
[04:39:26] that can be F use footage like refining
[04:39:28] but I
[04:39:30] mean and let this character carry you be
[04:39:32] sure to ascend them and level them as
[04:39:34] high as you can level their weapon as
[04:39:35] well as well as giving them Echoes of
[04:39:36] the correct main stat and ideally set as
[04:39:38] well early game don't worry about sub
[04:39:39] stats at all and even until you start
[04:39:41] unlocking four and five star Echoes I
[04:39:42] would recommend just using kind of
[04:39:43] whatever you have don't waste too many
[04:39:44] resources leveling them just try to get
[04:39:46] good main stats and ideally irrelevant
[04:39:47] set for them for example giving them
[04:39:49] damage or attack and then using them to
[04:39:50] progress until you unlock the harder
[04:39:52] game modes get deeper set set matters
[04:39:54] more than stat like stats matter more
[04:39:56] than sets Okay how do I say this like
[04:39:58] main stats matter the most in games but
[04:40:00] it's like in in early early game
[04:40:03] W if you're not leveling your main stat
[04:40:06] like yeah it's nice but a lot of the
[04:40:08] times like this part you're getting here
[04:40:11] is just more important like 10% aor
[04:40:12] damage bonus 30% eror damage bonus
[04:40:15] that's 40 for nothing you don't even
[04:40:16] have to level anything you just equip it
[04:40:18] like free so set actually matters like
[04:40:21] especially if you're not spending
[04:40:23] resources like yeah I'm sure late game
[04:40:25] like twopiece twopiece if your substats
[04:40:27] are better is more efficient but that's
[04:40:28] assuming you even have substats early
[04:40:30] game you don't even have substats you
[04:40:30] have like one subat your party other
[04:40:32] characters and eventually more than one
[04:40:34] team if you're not sure on if you're
[04:40:35] going to use the character you're
[04:40:36] leveling later well fear not if for
[04:40:37] example you start with Rover and
[04:40:38] eventually want to main GN because as I
[04:40:40] said more than one character and more
[04:40:41] than one team will be needed now for
[04:40:43] your Echoes it's important to have a
[04:40:44] main Echo that helps you out an early
[04:40:46] game with Echoes that aren't leveled
[04:40:47] having a set that just gives you damage
[04:40:49] bonus or attack on top of a good main
[04:40:50] stat will give you a good amount of
[04:40:52] stats even without needing to level your
[04:40:53] Echoes I don't recommend leveling your
[04:40:54] Echoes early game unless you really need
[04:40:56] to at least until you can get echo of
[04:40:57] higher Rarities right fine those are
[04:41:00] what you want to be farming if you need
[04:41:01] to level low rank Echo technically still
[04:41:03] okay because you can either feed them
[04:41:04] for XP later or use them on other
[04:41:06] characters that aren't built for you yet
[04:41:07] but ideally wait till gold or at least
[04:41:08] purple Echoes before you start leveling
[04:41:10] them to clear content with gold
[04:41:11] obviously being the best and purple
[04:41:12] being fine as well with main stats
[04:41:14] mattering the most and then sub stats
[04:41:15] being a nice bonus as well now I do want
[04:41:16] to point out that if you're not grinding
[04:41:17] the game that heavy you're not rushing
[04:41:19] to get the better higher quality Echoes
[04:41:21] it can be okay to level some Echoes a
[04:41:22] little bit the first few levels don't
[04:41:24] cost that much especially for like your
[04:41:25] main Echo that can give you a lot of
[04:41:27] stats it can be okay to level it a bit
[04:41:28] even if it's of a lesser Rarity but
[04:41:30] obviously the higher Rarity Echoes will
[04:41:31] be used on your account for longer if
[04:41:33] you can grind your data Bank to the
[04:41:34] higher levels also you get purple tuners
[04:41:36] differently to the gold ones so if
[04:41:37] you're leveling a purple Echo you can
[04:41:38] use those to unlock the sub stats as a
[04:41:40] separate resource in the gold ones and
[04:41:41] then you can eventually just use them on
[04:41:42] other characters or feed them for more
[04:41:44] Echo XP in a different piece it's also
[04:41:45] worth mentioning that your echo's set
[04:41:47] effect matters too but obviously won't
[04:41:48] give you as much damage bonus as a
[04:41:49] correct main stat so keep that in mind
[04:41:51] when choosing your Echoes regarding your
[04:41:52] gear and character progression it is
[04:41:54] always recommended to max out your
[04:41:55] character level weapon level and talents
[04:41:57] before moving on to Echoes generally
[04:41:58] speaking you want to make sure not to
[04:41:59] waste your resources uncap your stamina
[04:42:01] equivalent resin equivalent called wave
[04:42:03] plate in this game spend it on the
[04:42:04] resources you need making sure it's
[04:42:05] uncapped focusing on ascending your
[04:42:06] characters by clearing bosses getting
[04:42:08] the XP materials and getting any
[04:42:09] material you need to level your weapons
[04:42:11] abilities and characters generally for
[04:42:12] the early game farming bosses is
[04:42:14] incredibly efficient as you need the
[04:42:15] materials to ascend your characters in
[04:42:16] order to level them up on top of also
[04:42:18] getting some additional materials that
[04:42:19] will help you level something else you
[04:42:20] should understand is that regarding your
[04:42:21] stamina or wave plate you will get
[04:42:23] Crystal solvents which are the
[04:42:24] equivalent of fragile resin these when
[04:42:25] you pop them you get 60 wave plate
[04:42:27] whenever and you can use these to help
[04:42:28] you get more materials and progress
[04:42:29] faster in mind I would recommend waiting
[04:42:31] until a higher Soul three phase which
[04:42:33] levels up with every 10 Union levels so
[04:42:35] as you progress your this 2x speed it's
[04:42:38] 1.25 pH the World level equivalent will
[04:42:41] increase and it's typically recommended
[04:42:42] to wait until Level 40 or higher to that
[04:42:45] in mind if you really want to use them
[04:42:46] to just level up a character or progress
[04:42:48] you can it's just more efficient to save
[04:42:50] them up into later for better rewards
[04:42:52] regarding the combat in this game it's
[04:42:54] honestly very unique in the sense that
[04:42:55] you want to be quick swapping between
[04:42:57] characters using their intro and outro
[04:42:59] skill once you build up enough conserto
[04:43:01] energy and you see the numbers on the
[04:43:02] right side of your screen your other
[04:43:04] characters sort of flashing that means
[04:43:05] you can swap into them use your outro
[04:43:07] skill on your active character and then
[04:43:09] swap into whichever character you chose
[04:43:11] and doing their intro skill this is a
[04:43:13] core part of the combat system alongside
[04:43:15] your resonance skill and resonance
[04:43:16] Liberation also known as skill and
[04:43:18] ultimate and also basic attacking in
[04:43:20] between to help build up your other
[04:43:22] abilities while if you have one main DPS
[04:43:24] character you can kind of just swap
[04:43:25] through your two others using their
[04:43:27] abilities and then focusing on one
[04:43:28] especially if you have at least two
[04:43:30] characters built you can swap between
[04:43:31] them using their intro and outro skills
[04:43:33] resonance skills resonance liberations
[04:43:35] and also their echo's ability don't
[04:43:37] forget that in order to get more damage
[04:43:39] and more value in your rotations
[04:43:41] although there are some exceptions like
[04:43:42] characters that want to stay on field
[04:43:43] and attack inside of their ultimate
[04:43:45] again if you want more information about
[04:43:47] more detailed combat stuff more guides
[04:43:49] and character specific things leave a
[04:43:50] comment as I may be interested in making
[04:43:53] videos about this subject another huge
[04:43:55] mistake I want my viewers to avoid is
[04:43:57] wasting your asteres a very premium
[04:43:59] currency and what allows you to get the
[04:44:01] character of your dreams did I added
[04:44:02] this later cuz I saw I wasn't going to
[04:44:04] talk about this but I saw uh uh dude I
[04:44:07] saw okay I'm going to be honest I saw Mt
[04:44:11] make a full like 10minute video being
[04:44:13] like don't pull on the wrong banner and
[04:44:15] then I was thinking I was like okay I
[04:44:17] guess some people are just new and might
[04:44:19] just do a dumbass mistake so I'm going
[04:44:21] to be like hey don't do this wasting
[04:44:23] these to refresh your stamina and I also
[04:44:25] wouldn't recommend typically
[04:44:27] purchasing standard permanent Banner
[04:44:29] pulls and saving these up for the
[04:44:30] limited characters as you can purchase
[04:44:32] your premium pulls with these asteres
[04:44:34] they both cost the same amount of
[04:44:36] asteres but on one Banner you can get
[04:44:38] characters that are always available and
[04:44:39] on the other it will be a character that
[04:44:40] is is rotating only 32 pools dude I
[04:44:43] don't know it is what it is and if you
[04:44:45] lose your 50/50 then you will get one of
[04:44:47] the standard characters anyways while
[04:44:48] pulling on the beginner banner and also
[04:44:51] the permanent Banner for the sort of
[04:44:52] free calling viewers D yeah if you pull
[04:44:56] spend all your [ __ ] gems on the sard
[04:44:58] ban you deserve it I mean it's okay you
[04:45:00] can admit it I'm dumb I admit it but
[04:45:02] like it is what it is you learn now
[04:45:04] you'll do better I got scammed in
[04:45:06] [ __ ] RuneScape and now I know not to
[04:45:08] trust random people and I became a
[04:45:10] better stronger human since then PS I
[04:45:14] lost my brother's Bandos with the free
[04:45:16] pulls we're getting right through things
[04:45:17] like events as you play level up unlock
[04:45:20] things like this one the Awakening
[04:45:21] Journey that gives you just a bunch of
[04:45:23] pulls that you get through many sources
[04:45:24] these pulls that are only meant to be
[04:45:26] used on the permanent Banner are
[04:45:28] obviously a more efficient way to pull
[04:45:30] on the permanent Banner without needing
[04:45:31] to spend your asites now granted if
[04:45:33] you're just a bit away from a five star
[04:45:34] and you want it and it will help you
[04:45:36] enjoy the game then be my guest you can
[04:45:38] spend your currency however you want to
[04:45:39] but for the most part it is typically
[04:45:41] recommended to save up your asites and
[04:45:42] spend them on a character or even weapon
[04:45:44] that you want that is limited lastly a
[04:45:47] big trap I want people to avoid that I
[04:45:49] have learned in my Years playing gacha
[04:45:50] games is try your best to avoid fomo
[04:45:53] fear of missing out for a lot of
[04:45:54] different things progress at your own
[04:45:56] pace enjoy the game if you don't like
[04:45:58] doing quests and you don't want to it's
[04:46:00] okay you can explore fight bosses focus
[04:46:02] on whatever you enjoy doing if that
[04:46:04] brings you the most enjoyment because
[04:46:05] obviously dude this [ __ ] literally
[04:46:07] captured it fomo Pho I have to change
[04:46:09] the description now
[04:46:11] in mind even with the gacha system which
[04:46:13] can get you some cool characters weapons
[04:46:15] and all that stuff understand that you
[04:46:17] don't need them to clear content there's
[04:46:19] a lot of good four stars a lot of good
[04:46:20] weapons and even a five star you'll be
[04:46:22] getting through the beginner Banner that
[04:46:23] can help you out and you shouldn't feel
[04:46:25] forced to pull for any specific
[04:46:27] character or even use your as it's the
[04:46:29] first step of the loop the the [ __ ]
[04:46:31] YouTuber pipeline is you you you start
[04:46:33] doing YouTuber jokes you [ __ ] double
[04:46:35] down on the clickbait and then you end
[04:46:37] up making a ukulele apology I don't want
[04:46:39] to you come back rip the dog hey guys I
[04:46:42] you know I'm I'm a I'm sorry for you
[04:46:44] know what I did 26 months ago get more
[04:46:48] stamina save up your asterids pull for
[04:46:50] characters you like weapons you like
[04:46:51] whatever and don't feel baited as a lot
[04:46:54] of the times in a lot of gotta games you
[04:46:55] can pull for a character and then a week
[04:46:57] or a month later regret it and wish you
[04:46:59] hadn't done it while personally I really
[04:47:00] like the 1.0 characters Gan and yinling
[04:47:03] don't feel forced to spend your asites
[04:47:05] or real money unless it's for something
[04:47:06] that you think is wor you have your dog
[04:47:09] there for like the points are like
[04:47:10] working out
[04:47:13] these were my tips quick start in weaing
[04:47:15] waves avoid some mistakes and progress
[04:47:17] efficiently with that in mind be sure to
[04:47:19] have fun remember it's just game I know
[04:47:21] I will be having tons of fun with
[04:47:22] weathering waves be sure to check me out

[04:47:26] will like I'm not complaining but like
[04:47:28] is that how it works I don't know I

[04:48:18] part was it was good I enjoyed it if I
[04:48:20] was a viewer I would like it this part I
[04:48:22] want to trim like 10 seconds though I
[04:48:24] feel like I said something about The
[04:48:26] Echoes like four times I'm going to
[04:48:27] remove
[04:48:35] one self liked oh
[04:48:39] wa yeah
[04:48:42] [Music]
[04:48:46] wait Allan I know you're
[04:48:53] here think I should remove like 10
[04:48:56] seconds when I reset the same Echo thing
[04:48:58] 26
[04:49:00] times wait it was like here I noticed it
[04:49:03] it was like
[04:49:06] here and that can be fine if you have a
[04:49:09] for that's and
[04:49:11] ideally characters before moving on and
[04:49:14] spreading yourself even more thinly with
[04:49:16] that in mind though I have to say
[04:49:17] something that I've noticed through
[04:49:19] playing just not knowing what to do it
[04:49:21] be getting a five star from the beginner
[04:49:22] banner and so getting a character is
[04:49:24] giving them Echoes of the correct main
[04:49:25] relevant set for them for example damage
[04:49:28] or attack and then using them to
[04:49:29] progress until you unlock the harder
[04:49:30] game modes get deeper into the game and
[04:49:31] then want to start leveling your party
[04:49:32] other characters and eventually if
[04:49:34] you're not sure on if you're going to
[04:49:35] use the character you're leveling later
[04:49:36] well Fe not set that just gives you
[04:49:37] damage bonus or attack on top of a good
[04:49:38] main stat will give you a good amount of
[04:49:40] stats without needing to level your
[04:49:41] Echoes I don't recommend leveling your
[04:49:42] Echoes early game unless you really need
[04:49:43] to at least until you can get Echoes of
[04:49:45] higher Rarities right purple Echo are
[04:49:46] fine gold Echoes are the best those are
[04:49:47] what you want to be farming if you need
[04:49:48] level low rank Echo it's technically
[04:49:49] still okay because you can either feed
[04:49:50] them for XP later or use them on other
[04:49:52] characters that aren't built for you yet
[04:49:53] but ideally wait till gold or at least
[04:49:54] purple Echoes before you start leveling
[04:49:55] them to clear content with gold
[04:49:56] obviously being the best and purple
[04:49:57] being fine as well with main stats
[04:49:58] mattering the most and then sub stats
[04:49:59] being a nice bonus as well now I do want
[04:50:00] to point out that if you're not grinding
[04:50:01] the game that heavy five star Echoes I
[04:50:03] would recommend just using kind of
[04:50:04] whatever you have don't it by chucking
[04:50:05] multiple weapons of the same type into
[04:50:06] it and that can be fine or five weapon
[04:50:08] they can just give you more stats and
[04:50:09] can be better and let this character
[04:50:10] carry you be sure to ascend them and
[04:50:11] level them as high as you can level
[04:50:12] their weapon as well as well as giving
[04:50:13] them Echoes of the correct main stat and
[04:50:14] ideally set as well early game don't
[04:50:16] worry about sub stats at all and even
[04:50:17] until you start unlocking four and five
[04:50:18] star Echoes I would recommend just using
[04:50:19] kind of whatever you have don't waste
[04:50:20] too many resources leveling them just
[04:50:21] try to get good main stats and ideally
[04:50:23] irrelevant set for them for example
[04:50:24] giving them damage or attack and then
[04:50:25] using them to progress until you unlock
[04:50:26] the harder game modes get deeper into
[04:50:27] the game and then want to start leveling
[04:50:28] your party other characters and
[04:50:29] eventually more than one team if you're
[04:50:31] not sure on if you're going to use the
[04:50:32] character you're leveling later well
[04:50:32] fear not if for example you start with
[04:50:34] Rover and eventually want to mainen
[04:50:35] because as I said more than one
[04:50:36] character and more than one team will be
[04:50:37] needed now for your Echoes it's
[04:50:38] important to have a main Echo that helps
[04:50:40] you out and game with Echo that aren't
[04:50:41] leveled having a set that just gives you
[04:50:42] damage bonus or attack on top of a good
[04:50:43] main stat good without needing to level
[04:50:46] your Echo I don't recommend leveling
[04:50:47] your Echoes early game unless you really
[04:50:48] need to at least until you can get
[04:50:49] Echoes of higher Rarities right purple
[04:50:51] Echo are fine gold Echo are the best
[04:50:52] those are what you want to be farming if
[04:50:53] you need level low rank Echoes it's
[04:50:54] technically still okay because you can
[04:50:55] either feed them for XP later those okay
[04:50:56] okay I got it I got it I got it I got it
[04:50:58] uh trim and cut okay I figured it out
[04:51:00] new cut I [ __ ] hate YouTube editor
[04:51:03] it's so [ __ ] but it's fine level and
[04:51:04] talents before that's being a nice bonus
[04:51:06] as well now I do want to point out that
[04:51:07] if you're not grinding the game that it
[04:51:09] was wait where was it Le until you can
[04:51:10] get e of hoing on to Echo generally
[04:51:12] speaking that if you're not them but
[04:51:14] also waste them it can be hard to know
[04:51:16] four and more than amount of start
[04:51:17] leveling them level your Echo if you're
[04:51:19] not sure on if you're going to use the
[04:51:20] character G and then want to start
[04:51:21] leveling your party other characters and
[04:51:24] eventually more than one
[04:51:26] team
[04:51:28] [Music]
[04:51:33] enhance here what time is this 0 85707
[04:51:41] 08 5707 boom and then we resume at let
[04:51:46] me see going to use the character
[04:51:48] leveling later well fear not if for
[04:51:49] example you start with Rover and
[04:51:50] eventually want to character and more
[04:51:51] than leveled having a set that just
[04:51:53] gives needing to level are fine gold EO
[04:51:54] are the best beat them for XP later or
[04:51:56] use them on other characters that aren't
[04:51:57] built for you yet but ideally wait them
[04:51:58] for example giving them damage or you
[04:52:01] can either feed them for XP later the
[04:52:02] most I don't recommend leveling your
[04:52:03] Echo early game unless you really need
[04:52:05] to at least until you can get Echoes of
[04:52:06] higher Rarities right purple Echo are
[04:52:07] fine gold Echo are the best those are
[04:52:08] what you want to be farming if you need
[04:52:09] level low rank Echoes it's technically
[04:52:10] still oh here here
[04:52:14] here oh of higher Rarities right purple
[04:52:17] echos are fine gold Echo are the best
[04:52:19] want farming if you need level low rank
[04:52:20] ech it's technically still okay because
[04:52:21] you can either feed for XP farming if
[04:52:23] you need level low rank oh
[04:52:25] there no way bro is editing on stream
[04:52:28] instead of playing is truly benched now
[04:52:32] I think it's here
[04:52:34] 93049 yeah 9:30
[04:52:36] 49 9349
[04:52:44] oh I didn't preview okay well let's
[04:52:45] listen more than one team if you need
[04:52:47] level low rank ech and then want to
[04:52:49] start leveling your part and eventually
[04:52:51] more than one
[04:52:53] team team okay there's like a let me
[04:52:56] remove one
[04:52:59] frame if low rank e and then here I'll
[04:53:02] start one frame
[04:53:08] earlier into the game and then want to
[04:53:10] start your party other characters and
[04:53:11] eventually more than one team if you
[04:53:12] need to level low rank Echoes it's
[04:53:13] technically still okay
[04:53:15] because two
[04:53:17] frames if you need level low rank ech
[04:53:20] than one team if you need level low rank
[04:53:21] Echo it's technically see if you need
[04:53:22] level low rank e
[04:53:29] okay

[05:01:40] timed
[05:01:42] out I see it I saw it you can't fool
[05:01:47] me let me post the video here
[05:01:50] boom
[05:01:55] okay why do you just say a whole last
[05:01:57] essay after getting hit for two
[05:02:05] damage dud I was thinking about it do
[05:02:07] you think when someone y okay you know a
[05:02:09] while ago I saw like a a post was like
[05:02:11] what is taking one HP of damage in real
[05:02:14] life and like people like paper cut this
[05:02:16] that right I was thinking recently I was
[05:02:17] like dude when someone else yawns
[05:02:19] yawning is the most contagious thing in
[05:02:21] the world by the way when someone else
[05:02:22] yawns you cannot take one point even
[05:02:24] thinking or talking about yawning at
[05:02:26] least one person in my chat right now
[05:02:27] yawned no probably like five literally
[05:02:31] when when when you see someone yawn you
[05:02:33] take one point of fatigue damage and
[05:02:35] then it like like yeah so every time
[05:02:37] someone yawns you take one damage
[05:03:00] true I'm holding back the yawn let it
[05:03:03] consume you you are tired you want to
[05:03:06] yawn but you're not tired enough to go
[05:03:07] to bed
[05:03:18] that dragon is going nuts hey me too
[05:03:21] what this doesn't even make sense why
[05:03:22] did I say
[05:03:29] that I don't really want to Al here
[05:03:48] I don't even want that I just wanted
[05:03:50] Echoes oh I did get one

[05:04:23] door should I do more you get good
[05:04:25] rewards from this right
[05:04:41] okay chat in 1 hour I'm going to upload
[05:04:42] the second W video cuz we literally have
[05:04:44] two ready two t maybe not 1 hour but
[05:04:46] maybe that's wishful thinking
[05:04:55] [Music]
[05:05:25] the [ __ ] Kevin Hart was on Kai
[05:05:32] stream the
[05:05:38] [ __ ] I'll watch that
[05:05:44] later whoa that's so skibbidy I'm sorry
[05:05:47] I actually can't believe I said that
[05:05:49] okay let's go uh trial character no
[05:05:51] we'll use this
[05:06:08] one how do you have every character I
[05:06:10] don't I don't I really don't have that
[05:06:16] many basically here's the rundown you
[05:06:19] get one guaranteed five star from the
[05:06:20] beginner Banner then you can usually get
[05:06:24] asteroides for like a decent chance on
[05:06:26] The Limited Banner not not like a full
[05:06:28] one actually okay to be fair we got
[05:06:29] we've gotten a lot of pulls in the
[05:06:31] mail uh I got an early I got lucky I got
[05:06:35] an early calaro ONN banner and they got
[05:06:37] lingyang for free that's it free to play
[05:06:40] and then now okay that that part is true
[05:06:42] but then listen listen the part that's
[05:06:44] not true is that after the Karo we may
[05:06:47] have swiped something for the GN but
[05:06:49] it's only a you know he's not like uh
[05:06:52] he's you know no constellations no RC
[05:06:57] car also yesterday I said I would give
[05:07:01] away a GN I'm down to do it but like
[05:07:04] last time [ __ ] buying the character
[05:07:06] was like cringe but like I don't mind
[05:07:08] giving a viewer the the like pulls I
[05:07:10] just don't know if I can like input my
[05:07:11] pay cuz I have to use a fake zip code
[05:07:13] like I don't want to commit fraud but
[05:07:15] like I there's no zip code in Canada so
[05:07:17] I don't know what to do so like I might
[05:07:18] just have to PayPal someone but like
[05:07:20] that's weird like I'm not just going to
[05:07:21] PayPal
[05:07:30] someone oh what if I PayPal a viewer and
[05:07:34] then they top up on their account and
[05:07:37] then I log in and I pull for Content but
[05:07:39] then the problem is what if they just
[05:07:40] take the money and then use it on like
[05:07:42] something smarter than gacha like
[05:07:44] groceries which they should do honestly
[05:07:46] I wouldn't blame them then that's [ __ ]
[05:07:48] then I'm
[05:07:59] just [ __ ] you stop yawning bro I I was
[05:08:03] talking about that like 20 minutes ago
[05:08:04] are you on Mobile H how are you at that
[05:08:06] part of the stream we've moved on we've
[05:08:09] explored like four different
[05:08:13] topics okay I feel like crownless is
[05:08:15] better but we haven't tried uh Inferno
[05:08:17] yet so let's try
[05:08:19] Inferno actually I don't know which
[05:08:21] one's better I'm just

[05:12:21] attack you get attack per and defense
[05:12:22] Skilling with refinement but also

[05:13:17] use but then to sound more uh audite I
[05:13:20] started using it just sounds more
[05:13:24] complex but then you run out of like
[05:13:26] placeholder filler words so you have to
[05:13:27] use
[05:13:37] both I am a
[05:13:49] oh my God you play on JP okay now that

[05:14:02] one I mean I think they're all probably
[05:14:04] fine but I don't
[05:14:05] know I feel like the the Japanese one
[05:14:07] felt better than the English one but but
[05:14:09] that's not to say something bad I just I
[05:14:10] don't know maybe I'm a
[05:14:17] wee
[05:14:20] [ __ ] bro is scared no I don't want to be
[05:14:22] like cuz I don't want people to be like

[05:14:35] English sounds cool still so it's not

[05:15:11] brother there's only three things I love
[05:15:13] in this world I'm not going to say the
[05:15:15] same one joke I'm
[05:15:18] sorry the voice actors are good as just
[05:15:20] that they're put on unnatural accents
[05:15:21] and direction is not that great that is
[05:15:23] a good way to word it that is a good way
[05:15:25] to word
[05:15:35] it uh Let me refresh my video
[05:15:40] in today's video read one comment what
[05:15:42] is the first comment thanks for weaing
[05:15:44] my waves I can't take it anymore I'm
[05:15:46] sick of mortify I try to play J Shin
[05:15:48] okay no one will know I like man okay fa
[05:15:51] no
[05:15:53] okay thank you for making these tips
[05:16:01] nice
[05:16:04] cool is this like simulated Universe
[05:16:07] yep are you PX PC what sex PC specs
[05:16:11] trying to build a new one uh I don't
[05:16:13] recommend my build for the average
[05:16:16] consumer there are cost efficient gpus I
[05:16:20] got a not cost efficient one because at
[05:16:21] the time 3090 was the best I'm like [ __ ]
[05:16:23] it I'm only going to buy one PC so I got
[05:16:25] a 3090 uh but at this point like I'm
[05:16:29] lowkey
[05:16:31] uh might need a second one not an
[05:16:33] upgrade but like for another
[05:16:35] setup the only thing I would upgrade is
[05:16:37] my graphics card
[05:16:39] cuz at the time uh the graphics card I
[05:16:42] got was the best wait what was the other
[05:16:44] one I didn't see whatever the graphics
[05:16:45] card I got sorry the did I say graphics
[05:16:47] card the CPU I got was the best but now
[05:16:50] there's like I'm pretty sure Intel is
[05:16:52] kind of dominating and there's like new
[05:16:54] ones that came out new like
[05:16:57] I9 like 11 or 12 or 15K whatever the
[05:17:00] [ __ ]
[05:17:10] get a thread Ripper dude that's like a
[05:17:11] million dollars you think I'm [ __ ]
[05:17:12] made of money I mean yeah you know if I
[05:17:15] sold one of my many Lamborghinis I could
[05:17:18] but like the thing is I'd rather just
[05:17:20] keep all all like I like I like to have
[05:17:23] one per day of the month like I'm not
[05:17:25] going to you know Drive the same [ __ ]
[05:17:26] Ferrari every day for the like like the
[05:17:29] you know it's like it'll get boring so I
[05:17:31] like to have one per day of the month
[05:17:33] and then after I just like I'll give
[05:17:34] them to the my the local people in my
[05:17:36] area
[05:17:39] like you know how like Mr Beast bought
[05:17:41] like a [ __ ] the whole block or some
[05:17:43] [ __ ] he just like owned a like local
[05:17:46] [ __ ]
[05:17:47] Legend that's
[05:17:49] me but not in like the weird way where
[05:17:51] it's kind of like a little problematic
[05:17:53] if you think about it too long just in
[05:17:55] like the I just you know have too many
[05:17:57] cars I can't even drive it is what it is
[05:18:00] I mean I can but not
[05:18:02] really memory of training
[05:18:09] auction your ioto it will cover the cost
[05:18:12] unironically if I auction my 50 crit
[05:18:14] value Sands it would go for literally
[05:18:16] like $10,000 I'm not even joking because
[05:18:18] it I got it like 3 years ago it and even
[05:18:21] to this day the odds of you having a 50
[05:18:23] crit value piece are
[05:18:25] slim okay maybe not 10K it would be like
[05:18:27] 1K but if if there was like a
[05:18:29] Marketplace for like artifacts there
[05:18:31] would be a bunch of bots
[05:18:34] [Music]
[05:18:42] Liberation will you pull for
[05:18:46] yinin wait I just didn't make any noise
[05:18:49] yes I like
[05:18:51] in 1K bits to delete no I would
[05:18:54] genuinely would not delete the artifact
[05:18:55] for like $1,000 if I wasn't a streamer I
[05:18:58] would but now it's like the only thing I
[05:19:00] have it's all I
[05:19:03] got if I'm a casual player [ __ ] a good
[05:19:06] artifact I can just get another one like
[05:19:07] I don't need the best artifact act in
[05:19:08] the game but now oh I didn't re what
[05:19:10] that did wait what did I just lose 80%
[05:19:15] what you barely use it though honestly
[05:19:19] yeah you're right like I do use it but

[05:32:57] there might be one I don't want to know
[05:32:59] because I want to not fake a reaction if

[05:35:51] actually sorry I wish I was better I
[05:35:53] wish I was
[05:35:55] like a better content
[05:36:00] creator do you know who I think is like
[05:36:02] one of the best people at making content
[05:36:04] this is not about them or the quality or
[05:36:08] L like like how good or bad but I don't
[05:36:10] think it's bad but you know what I'm
[05:36:11] saying the content of the video is just
[05:36:14] how good they are at like producing
[05:36:16] pumping out content mtashed this guy has
[05:36:19] like the most content brain I have ever
[05:36:21] seen in my
[05:36:23] life dude 9 hours 11 hours 15 hours one
[05:36:26] day one day one day one day one day and
[05:36:28] it's not even
[05:36:29] like he's just tuned in this video where
[05:36:33] is it one of them I clicked on well I
[05:36:35] skipped through this one but this one I
[05:36:37] saw an a video called how to get your
[05:36:39] guaranteed five star I was in a call
[05:36:42] with Z I was like how do you make a
[05:36:44] video on how to get up like the five
[05:36:46] star like I feel like you just pull and
[05:36:48] then I I I was like scar me through I
[05:36:50] was like oh I didn't even think about
[05:36:51] that don't [ __ ] up and pull on the [ __ ]
[05:36:53] Banner because and like you might be
[05:36:55] like dude that's like the most obvious
[05:36:56] thing I've ever heard yeah but also the
[05:36:58] the videos he makes I feel like are
[05:36:59] tailored to like it's your first gacha
[05:37:01] game you just your mother just gave you
[05:37:03] a Christmas you just turned [ __ ] I
[05:37:05] mean I guess the age doesn't matter you
[05:37:06] just got a [ __ ] Christmas gift it's
[05:37:07] your first mobile phone you just
[05:37:09] downloaded your first app boom it's
[05:37:11] weing waves how do you not waste all
[05:37:13] your your your
[05:37:14] currency I can't get myself to record
[05:37:17] that [ __ ] I'm too like uh uh uh
[05:37:20] [ __ ] not metap pilled but
[05:37:23] like I don't
[05:37:30] know lazy no no it's not lazy it's like
[05:37:33] I can't I can't even come up with that
[05:37:35] idea like in my if I'm thinking of video
[05:37:37] ideas I'm not going to think of like I'm
[05:37:40] not going to think of
[05:37:42] like what what
[05:37:46] like I don't
[05:37:53] know you're the equivalent of a platinum
[05:37:56] player what do you mean a platinum [ __ ]
[05:37:57] you I'm
[05:38:05] radiant although okay Grant the
[05:38:08] I mean this is overall positive like I
[05:38:10] like I think he makes good content but
[05:38:11] I'm saying like I feel like me usually I
[05:38:13] I just Chuck a lot of things in one
[05:38:15] video instead of making like I think the
[05:38:17] the optimal way to maximize content and
[05:38:19] like growth and Views and [ __ ] is like
[05:38:21] you make a video for each thing that you
[05:38:24] think is
[05:38:25] relevant but I feel like I just Chuck
[05:38:28] everything in one video a lot of times
[05:38:29] like that's why my guys are [ __ ] 50
[05:38:31] minutes long and they get delayed so
[05:38:32] long cuz I have to edit like a whole
[05:38:35] [ __ ] two years [ __ ] uh uh what's
[05:38:38] the word dictionary that's the word I
[05:38:39] was looking
[05:38:44] for Inferno Rider no I'll do
[05:38:53] crownless wait I can
[05:38:55] refresh I mean I kind of want San cuz
[05:38:59] she's pretty but ice is useless here
[05:39:01] okay fine wait what the [ __ ] I didn't
[05:39:04] know you could get other things than
[05:39:05] characters
[05:39:08] is that why deluk guide took so long
[05:39:11] yes it got delayed the first time cuz I
[05:39:13] wanted to wait for dendo then got
[05:39:14] delayed cuz I wanted to wait for finina
[05:39:15] that got delayed cuz I wanted to wait
[05:39:16] for um Shen Yun that one was valid
[05:39:20] though the shenyun wait was valid but at
[05:39:21] that point I could have made one like
[05:39:23] just three different
[05:39:26] videos huge duuke
[05:39:32] Buffs but granted I think there's a big
[05:39:35] difference between making content for a
[05:39:37] new game G and making content for
[05:39:39] uh like
[05:39:41] yeah like I'm not like I feel like if
[05:39:43] you make new player content like uh
[05:39:45] don't pull on the standard Banner in
[05:39:47] genin it's like okay I get it but like
[05:39:50] for a new game it's like there's
[05:39:51] validity there like it makes
[05:39:57] [Music]
[05:40:00] sense I saw a post it was like my
[05:40:10] I want to get a loty you dude I got
[05:40:12] [ __ ] this sucks this actually
[05:40:16] sucks I mean the crit rate is good but
[05:40:18] the fire is
[05:40:30] useless wa my brother texted
[05:40:33] me oh he's okay cool
[05:40:48] how are you liking Wawa so far I like it
[05:40:49] a
[05:40:50] lot comat like when I'm doing stuff like
[05:40:53] this I have a lot of fun and exploration
[05:40:55] honestly a lot of parts character design
[05:40:57] I
[05:41:00] like I I obviously there's like I think
[05:41:03] hasht we're not that ad right now so to
[05:41:06] to the things I like less I think
[05:41:09] optimization uh
[05:41:11] localization and some of the story
[05:41:15] slash
[05:41:16] Quest stuff well story and Quest are
[05:41:19] kind of synonyms but yeah
[05:41:43] you know what else is fun Elder ring I'm
[05:41:45] sure it is and we're going to play it I
[05:41:47] have it bought I bought it bought I
[05:41:49] bought it my brother played it he said
[05:41:51] it's
[05:41:59] great sonas bro are you done with
[05:42:03] hoyo there's a jcole lyric that states
[05:42:06] you like two legends can't
[05:42:10] coexist the compet dude it's it's
[05:42:12] manufactured competition it's
[05:42:16] manufactured it's manufactured outrage
[05:42:19] like you know we can like both or hate
[05:42:21] both or hate one like the other you know
[05:42:24] you do
[05:42:27] you Chad do you think I'm the jcole of
[05:42:30] of of of weathering waves be
[05:42:35] honest no
[05:42:38] dude people made fun of him for backing
[05:42:40] out but it was literally the like even
[05:42:43] at the time okay no like no bias no
[05:42:45] hindsight hary even at the time I was
[05:42:47] like dude like I get it like you don't
[05:42:49] want to [ __ ] start uh uh uh uh like
[05:42:52] start [ __ ] or like continue [ __ ] when
[05:42:54] you're just chilling it's not your fight
[05:42:56] not your not your circus not your
[05:43:01] monkeys you're the sexy red no I'm not
[05:43:13] [Music]
[05:43:22] this thing is sick I actually really
[05:43:24] like this [ __ ]
[05:43:25] Echo like in this game mode do you have
[05:43:29] to dodge when you're inside the
[05:43:30] crownless like do I take damage if I
[05:43:31] take damage I feel like I'm low HP now
[05:43:33] did I just take a bunch of damage I
[05:43:35] spice of waa
[05:43:47] foreign
[05:43:49] spee
[05:43:58] speech for
[05:44:09] dude I saw a tweet I probably shouldn't
[05:44:11] bring this up I saw a tweet that was
[05:44:12] like I can't wait for genin math people
[05:44:15] to know re do math in weathering waves
[05:44:17] and realize that it doesn't matter when
[05:44:19] you have to dodge their meta characters
[05:44:21] don't matter and then it's like the
[05:44:23] consensus now is like I don't know okay
[05:44:26] I know like Z Jeff said this but I know
[05:44:28] a bunch of other people said it too they
[05:44:29] were like oh yeah mortifies is just
[05:44:31] cracked he does so much damage and now
[05:44:32] everyone's playing Mori like yeah he's
[05:44:33] cracked he does so much damage
[05:44:38] bro just
[05:44:40] dodge just
[05:44:42] dodge if a character is good a character
[05:44:44] is good no amount of skill
[05:44:48] issue I mean I guess skill issue changes
[05:44:52] that but it it like it will make you
[05:44:55] know defensive utility characters better
[05:44:58] like you know Jan
[05:45:02] Shin although I still don't know like I
[05:45:04] know what she does I can explain to you
[05:45:06] every not yeah pretty much everything
[05:45:07] that she does and her strengths and
[05:45:09] weaknesses but I can't tell you how good
[05:45:11] she is I tried my
[05:45:17] hardest it's the Jeff no no it wasn't
[05:45:19] about him it wasn't about him it was
[05:45:21] just it was in
[05:45:22] general kind of don't want red or blue I
[05:45:25] also don't want Yan wo I mean whatever
[05:45:27] I'll just take
[05:45:34] it mortify plus any main DPS is good
[05:45:36] enough for early game yes but I also
[05:45:38] think that
[05:45:39] mortify plus a like I guess not any DPS
[05:45:42] but a solid DPS will be
[05:45:44] what okay to be fair when I say or
[05:45:47] people say I don't like calling
[05:45:49] characters the ex character of another
[05:45:50] game in a game like when people call
[05:45:53] Silver Wolf the Kazo of of of Sara tilts
[05:45:55] me um but the Sim like one of the main
[05:45:59] similarities he has with strangling is
[05:46:01] his [ __ ] fourth cop like
[05:46:02] constellation whatever it's called I'm
[05:46:03] taking so much damage as I'm talking let
[05:46:05] me lock in his fourth constellation
[05:46:07] is like insane as well and is what part
[05:46:09] of what makes them broken like shling
[05:46:12] without C4
[05:46:13] okay but becomes way better same with
[05:46:17] Mor but his outro skill is cracked in
[05:46:19] general
[05:46:26] so oh I unlocked a new skill waa that
[05:46:29] was pretty
[05:46:33] cool okay chat I
[05:46:39] I have a like sponsored like Vlog to put
[05:46:43] out on my second Channel I actually
[05:46:45] managed to make it on the second channel
[05:46:46] so that I I cuz I don't like putting too
[05:46:48] much sponsor content on my main actually
[05:46:49] that's not true I don't mind it I don't
[05:46:50] hate it but like if I have the choice
[05:46:52] I'll just put on the second because it's
[05:46:53] more like it's less of like a guide it's
[05:46:55] more of just like I don't want to put a
[05:46:56] I don't want to upload a vlog cuz I
[05:46:57] think no one cares about me anyways it
[05:46:58] doesn't matter uh but but that's not
[05:47:00] true I know oh no I love you [ __ ] you
[05:47:01] die no okay I didn't say that that was
[05:47:03] [ __ ] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I
[05:47:05] appreciate you but no okay you know what
[05:47:07] I'm saying I just I didn't I don't know
[05:47:09] I I don't know why I said die I didn't
[05:47:10] mean that please don't thrive in in your
[05:47:13] existence uh tomorrow is brighter than
[05:47:15] today okay anyways I I just I'm sorry
[05:47:18] I'm sorry I didn't mean to say that but
[05:47:19] okay okay I just made up a fictional
[05:47:21] chatter okay no one said that no one
[05:47:23] said that anyways uh uh I my point is
[05:47:26] the only thing I wanted to say was I
[05:47:27] didn't even make I didn't even start
[05:47:29] editing it yet and it was supposed to
[05:47:31] like be ready by like June 1 no yeah
[05:47:33] like in like five days so I'm kind of
[05:47:35] [ __ ] the thing is I felt like awkward
[05:47:38] okay I'm not like
[05:47:39] socially um like nervous I don't know
[05:47:42] what the word is like I don't I'm not
[05:47:43] like awkward or like I don't get like
[05:47:45] anxiety like I'm fine like I'm pretty
[05:47:47] extroverted however I cannot [ __ ]
[05:47:51] record myself talking in public like
[05:47:53] it's just if I'm like yapping to a
[05:47:55] camera when there's like a bunch of
[05:47:56] people around me I just feel like so
[05:47:59] cringe but I know when other people do
[05:48:01] it it's like I don't mind it I'm like
[05:48:02] yeah whatever but when I do it I just
[05:48:04] can't do it so I ended up recording a
[05:48:06] bunch of footage but didn't talk that
[05:48:07] much so I'm going to have to record like
[05:48:08] voice over and like I don't know how I'm
[05:48:09] going to do that that's fine next time
[05:48:12] I'll do

[05:53:00] most I was talking again when I talk I
[05:53:03] die when I talk I die I was doing so
[05:53:05] good
[05:53:12] someone mentions girlfriend and he
[05:53:13] immediately goes to Z okay I meant it as
[05:53:15] like a friend that I'm like I've known
[05:53:17] for decades and I'm comfortable with in
[05:53:19] the sense of like he knows what I mean
[05:53:22] when I'm
[05:53:30] joking like if I go to a random chatter
[05:53:32] and I'm like [ __ ] you you suck they
[05:53:34] might be like yo what the hell what the
[05:53:36] h hell I suck what the hell but if I say

[05:54:05] wonder I actually have to think but I
[05:54:07] like that I like being you know I like
[05:54:08] having hard content not going to
[05:54:13] complain A wise man once
[05:54:17] said okay I don't want to preface it
[05:54:19] like that I've been told once a piece of
[05:54:21] advice I was complaining cuz I had so
[05:54:23] much [ __ ] [ __ ] to do and and my dad
[05:54:25] was like son you can't complain when you
[05:54:27] have no work and then complain when
[05:54:29] you're busy you got to pick a time to
[05:54:30] complain I'm like you know what that's
[05:54:31] right and and on a similar note you
[05:54:33] can't complain when content's easy and
[05:54:35] then also complain when it's hard so if
[05:54:37] it's hard I'll enjoy it and I'll [ __ ]
[05:54:38] shut my mouth maybe I'll [ __ ] fill my
[05:54:41] mouth why did I say that I'm sorry
[05:54:44] please don't clip
[05:54:48] that bro what the [ __ ]
[05:54:56] [Music]
[05:55:06] W [ __ ]
[05:55:28] [ __ ] was your Dad's reaction to the cplay
[05:55:30] he he hasn't seen me in the cosplay he
[05:55:31] saw me in the M outfit which is way

[05:56:19] [ __ ] no it wasn't if people believe it
[05:56:21] wasn't me then please keep believing

[05:56:26] employee dude it's not I'm not going to
[05:56:28] dox them but it was a real persons

[05:56:47] stream it was a little cringe but like
[05:56:50] in a good way anyways H we'll see we'll
[05:56:52] see you'll see when you see
[05:56:54] it I literally can't okay the thing is
[05:56:57] with that it's like it entirely depends
[05:56:59] on the editing it's either going to be
[05:57:00] cringe and awkward or POG and funny I
[05:57:02] don't know it's probably going to be a
[05:57:04] bit of both realistically we'll see
[05:57:10] [Music]
[05:57:12] anyways cring is fun embrace the cringe
[05:57:14] i i a wise man me once said don't kill
[05:57:17] the part of you that's cringe kill the
[05:57:20] part of you that

[06:02:27] close I'm in
[06:02:29] Canada I got owned you are Noob true
[06:02:33] actually maybe I need to take the
[06:02:34] defensive ones or just dodge but I
[06:02:36] didn't think he hit me from there so I
[06:02:37] didn't try to
[06:02:38] dodge I'm running it back that was fun
[06:02:41] I'm running it back I'm just going to
[06:02:42] dodge better I won't be dumb I won't be
[06:02:48] dumb I'm listening to not like us though

[06:04:10] what the [ __ ]
[06:04:12] I'm wait how do I open the I want to
[06:04:14] open the
[06:04:16] link so I can watch the full
[06:04:18] VOD
[06:04:23] nothing let me run over what happened
[06:04:25] here
[06:04:38] okay
[06:04:41] so I'll replay the song after you guys
[06:04:45] couldn't see this at the time let me
[06:04:46] explain why I was laughing cuz I saw
[06:04:49] this happen to someone else or other
[06:04:51] people I opened the survey here you guys
[06:04:54] couldn't see it cuz it was my uh OBS was
[06:04:57] on weathering waves and when you open
[06:04:58] the survey it doesn't show it unless you
[06:05:00] uncheck weathering so I opened the
[06:05:02] survey and then it popped up everything
[06:05:04] was in full Chinese
[06:05:12] so okay and then I closed it actually
[06:05:15] you guys could see it I I didn't wait I
[06:05:17] showed it in a
[06:05:19] second but you can't really see it but
[06:05:21] you see this was in Chinese but like the
[06:05:23] rest this is the second page so I reset
[06:05:25] it let me redo it let me redo it let me

[06:05:50] clip my in-game video so you guys could
[06:05:53] see it in Chinese because it Clips it

[07:07:21] they are EQ then you can q and swap
[07:07:23] cancel it to your other character intro
[07:07:25] skill whenever it's available and then
[07:07:26] you just cycle and then you have one
[07:07:27] character who's on field more often
[07:07:33] usually quick
[07:07:48] swap more
[07:07:52] teffy Q twice okay e r and then Q I

[07:24:51] maybe bro how do I preserve my stamina
[07:24:54] if I have to dodge and attack the only
[07:24:56] way I deal damage to this is by dodging
[07:24:58] how do I preserve stamina if four things
[07:25:00] are hitting me is there even a is there
[07:25:03] even a
[07:25:04] possibility how do you preserve stamina
[07:25:07] against four
[07:25:11] enemies there has to be a way to do
[07:25:16] it is there a food maybe there
[07:25:21] is how do I check I mean I don't have
[07:25:24] any I'm pretty sure

[07:25:40] up a bunch of Defense Echoes okay but
[07:25:42] it's not worth it for that wait is there
[07:25:44] one that's actually
[07:25:46] fun the first one we did was fun that
[07:25:48] one was a little cringe I can't lie if
[07:25:50] it's one enemy catch me parrying if it's
[07:25:53] four
[07:25:57] enemies yeah I don't know about that

[07:26:08] [Music]
[07:26:11] dailies no [ __ ] one enemy is free bro
[07:26:13] there's no way the like Peak content of
[07:26:16] like the endgame content of this game
[07:26:17] that we're going to be looking forward
[07:26:18] to is Parry attacking four enemies at
[07:26:22] once maybe I feel like it's usually
[07:26:24] going to be either single Target or [ __ ]
[07:26:26] that you can
[07:26:27] like kill all at the same time
[07:26:31] what the [ __ ] is

[07:44:17] even
[07:44:19] talk I didn't get the hit off

[07:44:45] cocky okay oh my God my [ __ ] BYU
[07:44:50] died I got cocky I got cocky I started
[07:44:52] hitting the other one I started fighting
[07:44:53] them both at once that's
[07:44:56] bad notice how I ran into it to Parry
[07:44:58] cuz I'm the [ __ ] goat I'll claim them
[07:45:00] both at once unless they disappear if
[07:45:01] there's a timer let me know
[07:45:05] but
[07:45:11] hello claim okay fine I'll check it
[07:45:14] later I'll check it later five star
[07:45:15] please be five star please be yes yes
[07:45:19] we'll check it later we won't check it
[07:45:20] yet we'll check them
[07:45:22] together I don't even know what set it
[07:45:24] is
[07:45:25] though uh no I don't want to revive her
[07:45:28] yeah
[07:45:32] holy [ __ ] I don't know what just
[07:45:33] happened I don't know this guy's attack
[07:45:35] pattern as as
[07:45:42] well oh he does like five attacks at
[07:45:44] once he's just like P
[07:45:47] back I have to hit him from the side if
[07:45:49] I hit him from the front I wait I just
[07:45:51] double pared him
[07:45:53] though are you going to let me do that
[07:45:55] to you me personally I wouldn't let
[07:45:56] someone double Parry me and get away
[07:45:57] with it
[07:46:16] dude I'm actually ready for Elder ring
[07:46:18] I'm telling
[07:46:27] you I'm like not like I'm basically
[07:46:30] Perma stunning him but I feel like I
[07:46:31] have less DPS this way cuz now I can't
[07:46:32] Parry like when he's like stunned I can
[07:46:34] damage him freely but I can't Parry cuz
[07:46:36] he's not attacking
[07:46:38] me oh I [ __ ]
[07:46:40] up ah I thought he would delay the
[07:46:42] attack
[07:46:43] longer oh my bad my bad my bad I
[07:46:47] suck such a weird
[07:46:51] timing yeah I guess I could
[07:46:56] just okay I one attack is slow the other
[07:46:59] one's fast I don't know how to predict
[07:47:01] which one he's going to do 45 seconds oh
[07:47:04] [ __ ] why did I revive
[07:47:09] by I died I died to a bird it's fine I
[07:47:12] killed one of them I killed one of them
[07:47:14] it doesn't matter I killed one of them
[07:47:15] it doesn't matter I killed one of them
[07:47:16] it doesn't matter I killed one of them
[07:47:18] it doesn't matter I killed one of them
[07:47:19] it doesn't matter I just go kill the
[07:47:21] other one now it's fine it's fine it's
[07:47:23] fine it's
[07:47:26] fine okay I know you can counter when
[07:47:28] he's he's [ __ ] golden but like the
[07:47:30] four times I tried to look I'll do it
[07:47:31] the four times I tried to counter he
[07:47:33] still hit me look look look look look
[07:47:35] I'll I'll basic attack when he's [ __ ]
[07:47:38] counterable okay I'm not there he cuz he
[07:47:40] does like six hits at once so if you try
[07:47:42] to hit when he's doing that [ __ ] like
[07:47:44] see I hit him it didn't do okay let me
[07:47:46] do it in front of him wait wa wait wait
[07:47:48] what is he doing okay wrong attack wrong
[07:47:53] attack like see I hit him
[07:48:03] like like I'm attacking him while he
[07:48:04] does that I it didn't work so I think I
[07:48:07] think it's not worth trying to get that
[07:48:08] that thing maybe there's a way to do it
[07:48:09] but like [ __ ] it lowkey I don't know why
[07:48:11] I still have by though in the
[07:48:21] party see like I just attacked him
[07:48:23] during it and it didn't do [ __ ] like I I
[07:48:25] swear I clicked the attack button
[07:48:30] oh [ __ ] okay I suck this guy's attack
[07:48:33] pattern is weird though in my defense
[07:48:34] his attack pattern is
[07:48:39] weird Okay I mean at this point I might
[07:48:41] as well just heal actually no it's
[07:48:45] fine what the [ __ ] was that he has never
[07:48:48] done that attack in my entire life what
[07:48:51] did he just do what did he just do he
[07:48:54] just [ __ ] zigzagged me in a z pattern
[07:49:04] what the [ __ ] was that he just learned a
[07:49:07] new
[07:49:11] move okay this enem is kind of fun
[07:49:13] though it's fun to learn let me do it
[07:49:15] again check the echo no no we're
[07:49:17] checking them both at once it it's more
[07:49:18] hype that way let me drink
[07:49:22] water I'll try to counter again see I
[07:49:26] hit he took damage it didn't do [ __ ]
[07:49:33] okay that was
[07:49:36] good I got to stop trying to [ __ ]
[07:49:38] counter
[07:49:45] it he doesn't attack me I'm standing
[07:49:51] still what the [ __ ]
[07:49:58] I got
[07:50:00] it wait but I can't even do
[07:50:11] that oh you have to time it it's not
[07:50:14] just hit the circle it's like a timing
[07:50:16] it's like he just and then you okay okay
[07:50:18] I got it I
[07:50:20] got don't get cocky don't get cocky you
[07:50:22] still suck at the game okay
[07:50:26] noted oh intro skills do damage
[07:50:29] too wait are are the enemies like this
[07:50:31] just weak to like intro skills and then
[07:50:33] like Parry attacks maybe they're all the
[07:50:36] same juice
[07:50:44] world
[07:50:46] oh I almost plunged into that [ __ ] I
[07:50:49] almost just
[07:50:52] died oh that was bad okay it happens it
[07:50:55] happens no no no it happens it
[07:50:57] happens no oh no it

[07:53:40] day reset and it cocked
[07:53:44] me why did I just I didn't get a reward
[07:53:49] no come
[07:53:53] back wait someone do it anyone who's
[07:53:56] done it do you get two Echoes or one if
[07:53:57] you only get one it's fine if you only
[07:53:59] get if you get two but if you only get
[07:54:01] one what's the point of killing the
[07:54:02] other one you only get one okay then why
[07:54:03] do you kill the okay okay it's fine at
[07:54:05] least I didn't get
[07:54:06] scammed was there anything I wanted to
[07:54:08] do before the day reset though I don't
[07:54:09] know it's fine okay let's check it Echo
[07:54:12] reveal chat Echo
[07:54:16] reveal
[07:54:23] please
[07:54:25] honestly honestly look look that's it's
[07:54:29] the wrong set but it's Electro damage
[07:54:31] bonus on a five star I feel like we can
[07:54:34] use that on a gold like I feel like
[07:54:36] that's usable even though the set
[07:54:40] sucks cuz Karo is one of our Mains and
[07:54:42] he's
[07:54:44] Electro is that not
[07:54:51] good wait let me see how rrolling
[07:54:54] works like strong boxing
[07:55:03] Comm merge five to a new
[07:55:07] one no that's not it that's not it wait
[07:55:10] is there no system to
[07:55:12] like roll the substats or something like
[07:55:15] isn't there a way to like modify your
[07:55:17] [ __ ] Echoes or some [ __ ] or is that
[07:55:19] fake
[07:55:26] news oh it's just the strong box for
[07:55:28] [ __ ] pieces I
[07:55:32] see smash what this
[07:55:35] thing
[07:55:41] hello you're getting used yeah I I know
[07:55:43] how like leveling them works and stuff
[07:55:44] but so now I'm permanently my Karo is
[07:55:48] for is like forever going to be on the
[07:55:51] wrong set my throat hurts on the wrong
[07:55:55] set
[07:55:59] I mean I could do two piece twopiece and
[07:56:01] then have a spare off piece how much do
[07:56:02] I
[07:56:03] lose 15% Electro damage but instead I
[07:56:07] gain 10% attack which is a bit worse but
[07:56:12] I get to run an offset piece which I
[07:56:14] think almost makes up for
[07:56:16] it am I
[07:56:21] wrong yeah I know I can get more five
[07:56:23] stars later but 15 time 2 wait I didn't
[07:56:26] read properly then
[07:56:29] oh it is
[07:56:31] 30 you're
[07:56:34] right okay yeah it matters a bit more
[07:56:38] but it's okay sub
[07:56:48] stats should I level
[07:56:52] it the
[07:56:54] five turn off outline why is oh it's
[07:56:57] here okay I was like why can I not see
[07:56:58] it
[07:57:07] cool what motorcycle enemy uh this one
[07:57:29] wait can I get one that's Arrow damage
[07:57:31] where' I have to go or like an attack
[07:57:33] dude attack percent is good on everyone
[07:57:35] although granted the five star I got
[07:57:36] that was ener like er is also good but
[07:57:38] it's ice so it's only good for like one
[07:57:41] character well
[07:57:45] two this is better to wait I said that
[07:57:49] in my video sorry no the data Bank 15 is
[07:57:52] good for for Farming
[07:57:55] Echoes cuz you can get five stars but I
[07:57:57] don't know if it matters for for like
[07:57:58] this [ __ ] maybe maybe it
[07:58:02] does I mean there's a way to get an
[07:58:04] early five star echo or gold
[07:58:09] Rarity what if I got this to plus five
[07:58:12] just to [ __ ] just for just you know
[07:58:14] to [ __ ] around
[07:58:41] no I'm not going to throw
[07:58:51] that wait
[07:58:59] that's literally not bad it's offset but
[07:59:01] like for now it's fine you need more
[07:59:03] cost
[07:59:06] okay
[07:59:08] um
[07:59:10] um
[07:59:12] um
[07:59:18] um but I just put a three cost again
[07:59:20] what I'm I'm looking for a one cost
[07:59:23] here I need a one cost that has attack
[07:59:26] set
[07:59:28] it's it's [ __ ]
[07:59:42] green okay this is
[07:59:44] better whatever I mean I don't know if I
[07:59:46] actually need this or care about it but
[07:59:48] cool cool to get I'm happy I wish the
[07:59:50] main stat wasn't Electro on a spectro
[07:59:52] set but we take
[07:59:55] it okay where are there other fun B I

[08:18:38] meat I I feel like playing a a gun
[08:18:41] character like mortify is broken but
[08:18:42] using a gun character here is kind of I
[08:18:44] don't like parrying with them uh well I
[08:18:46] mean I guess I I don't need to Parry I
[08:18:48] could just dodge attack and with a gun
[08:18:50] it's probably easier cuz I don't have to
[08:18:51] go melee range never mind I just
[08:18:52] convinced myself
[08:18:54] okay wellit let me try it actually
[08:19:01] oh I don't know
[08:19:04] what this timing is
[08:19:10] weird wait what the [ __ ] he just did and
[08:19:14] then didn't shoot bro okay maybe let me

[08:19:42] sorry this guy's uh like counter like
[08:19:45] Parry attack is kind of it feels slow
[08:19:47] like before the gun goes
[08:19:49] out I'm doing really well though I don't
[08:19:51] want to jinx it calm down
[08:19:56] oh dude he always that attack comes out
[08:19:59] way slower than it
[08:20:00] feels like it looks like it's going to
[08:20:02] hit you fast and then it hits you
[08:20:04] slow oh

[08:37:05] stuck in the vortex it's fine I can res
[08:37:07] that was the first death it doesn't
[08:37:08] matter no it wasn't the first death wait
[08:37:10] I already

[08:38:24] remember
[08:38:29] this is this content is pointless but
[08:38:31] it's fun so I'm doing it well I get a
[08:38:33] five star echos it's not really
[08:38:34] pointless
[08:38:39] but dude I am talented at dodging that's
[08:38:43] not a real comment just watch just watch
[08:38:46] okay does the healing I feel like the
[08:38:47] healing does nothing cuz I don't heal
[08:38:49] enough to not get one shot but like
[08:38:52] being a DPS doesn't matter either does
[08:38:53] it feel like it doesn't
[08:38:56] maybe the range character helps I just
[08:38:58] feel like he's not tanky
[08:39:00] enough like I got one shot if I don't
[08:39:02] have 6kp I mean everyone gets one
[08:39:05] shot I don't need a
[08:39:21] shield I need to get out of this field
[08:39:23] it's [ __ ] annoying to be in oh what
[08:39:25] the [ __ ] how do I get hit mid animation
[08:39:37] [Music]
[08:39:42] oopsies
[08:39:50] for call call themal skills
[08:40:09] I'm locked
[08:40:10] [Applause]
[08:40:14] in
[08:40:24] fore oh I didn't see the monkey throwing
[08:40:26] a rock I was looking at the [ __ ] get
[08:40:29] me out of here get me out of here I
[08:40:31] didn't see that
[08:40:32] guy dude this [ __ ] keeps hitting me
[08:40:35] the other ones I dodged the the [ __ ]
[08:40:37] poop slinging monkey keeps getting
[08:40:40] me like the big ones I see them and I'm
[08:40:42] fine the the piece of [ __ ] throwing the
[08:40:45] Rocks that's the one that gets
[08:40:47] me the little loser in the
[08:40:51] corner get the minions first honestly
[08:40:56] yeah
[08:40:58] probably but like I got the big one last
[08:41:00] time but yeah yeah you're probably
[08:41:03] right it's just kind of harder to it's
[08:41:06] easier to hit the big one if the small
[08:41:08] ones are far away cuz then they like
[08:41:09] kind of get less hits on you so I kind
[08:41:11] of H yeah
[08:41:23] whatever frame rate
[08:41:30] hello wait for stamina wait for stamina
[08:41:32] wait for stamina wait for stamina wait
[08:41:33] for
[08:41:39] stamina I probably should have came in
[08:41:41] with like abilities ready and [ __ ] but
[08:41:42] it's fine
[08:41:58] oh I didn't dodge in
[08:42:05] time what hit me sorry sorry sorry sorry
[08:42:09] sorry I I died again cuz I was talking I
[08:42:10] could have just
[08:42:12] revived what hit me tell me what hit me
[08:42:16] what hit me was it the
[08:42:19] grass was it the
[08:42:22] air was it the pollen do I have an
[08:42:26] allergy maybe maybe I do let me calm
[08:42:29] down feel like the music made me worse
[08:42:31] let me pause the
[08:42:36] music me
[08:43:14] okay okay I lost my touch I I don't know
[08:43:16] what's happening I I'm falling asleep I
[08:43:18] don't know what's
[08:43:20] happening okay the first de tilted me
[08:43:22] though second one doesn't matter how did
[08:43:24] I die after I dodged like why did it
[08:43:26] like linger and then still hit me did I
[08:43:28] have to double dodge to right click
[08:43:30] right click maybe I have to double dodge
[08:43:31] okay I have to double
[08:43:40] dodge
[08:43:43] whoa when I see you
[08:43:49] again should probably build my ALT up
[08:43:52] before I go but it's fine
[08:44:00] okay one
[08:44:11] sec what do I want to listen to I need
[08:44:14] something
[08:44:32] okay
[08:44:35] okay I actually think hitting the small
[08:44:37] monkeys is
[08:44:42] fake I just have to pay attention to
[08:44:46] them I did not pay attention to them
[08:45:09] like see when I'm walking it's not as I
[08:45:11] there's like a there's a window of time
[08:45:13] where I don't gain stamina back I don't
[08:45:15] know
[08:45:16] why trying to figure it out
[08:45:41] oh I
[08:45:43] didn't thought I dodged
[08:45:45] though oh no
[08:45:50] stamina I'm okay with not clearing here
[08:45:52] I'm just trying to figure out how I'm
[08:45:53] taking damage that's all
[08:45:57] like there I was like right clicking but
[08:45:58] I couldn't Dodge does the suction thing
[08:46:00] wait does this thing stop you from
[08:46:02] dodging let me walk in it if he does it
[08:46:06] again he's not doing
[08:46:09] it he's not doing it right now
[08:46:35] I enjoyed your cameo
[08:46:43] in okay I still don't know if that thing
[08:46:45] stops you from dodging or not cuz he's
[08:46:46] not using the attack anymore
[08:47:03] oh damn he double [ __ ] swiped wait
[08:47:05] that monkey slashes
[08:47:06] twice oh this is
[08:47:13] hard okay brown monkey does swipe swipe
[08:47:18] white monkey does rock and then big one
[08:47:21] does
[08:47:23] [ __ ] oh ball that's three attacks
[08:47:28] well he does d attacks
[08:47:31] but not going to rest I'm finishing this
[08:47:33] and then I will
[08:47:35] rest okay I think honestly this one's
[08:47:39] annoying but I can kind of kite him away
[08:47:41] maybe I do attack the white
[08:47:43] one maybe maybe I
[08:47:47] do okay Auto targeting does not want to
[08:47:55] yeah that thing stops me from being able
[08:47:56] to
[08:47:57] Dodge I missed all my
[08:48:23] attacks yeah I triy to weave in a hit
[08:48:25] between the two Dodges you have to just
[08:48:27] dodge twice you can't get a hit there
