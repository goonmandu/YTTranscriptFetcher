[00:09:24] I'm getting ready but yeah so uh rizzly
[00:09:27] batter's out obviously I already know
[00:09:29] how to build and play him and how good
[00:09:31] he is the guide is recorded it'll be out
[00:09:32] tonight or tomorrow morning I'm trying
[00:09:34] to finalize it um he's okay by the way I
[00:09:38] mean people are some one random idiot in
[00:09:40] chat spamming midly uh fun fact every
[00:09:43] Crow carry is mid but uh I don't think
[00:09:45] he's better than the others he's just
[00:09:46] like a decent option he's he's okay he's
[00:09:49] he's decent um he's I think he'll get
[00:09:52] better we don't know what finina does
[00:09:54] but I assume he'll get better with her
[00:09:55] no leaks no leaks I'm just saying I
[00:09:57] assume he will um but he's like okay I
[00:10:00] think nlet was broken I think he's a
[00:10:02] decent option but he's not like insane
[00:10:04] um there's some ways to make him better
[00:10:06] which we'll talk about today and there's
[00:10:08] some ways to make him worse
[00:10:11] uh but we'll talk about
[00:10:15] that I'll talk about
[00:10:23] that Roo said g AA is mid okay you're
[00:10:26] the one dude spamming I'm just going to
[00:10:28] give you like a I just don't want to see
[00:10:29] you in chat right now so I'm going to
[00:10:30] give you a week timeout just cuz I'm
[00:10:31] salty not at you but because I don't
[00:10:34] feel like explaining to new viewers why
[00:10:36] G is not the best unit it's just not
[00:10:38] worth my effort uh I think AA is pretty
[00:10:40] good though I think AA is pretty good
[00:10:42] but it's not worth my energy so we're
[00:10:44] going to pull now we're going to pull
[00:10:46] we're going to get rizley we're going to
[00:10:47] build him we're going to uh um build
[00:10:49] teams we're going to do all that and
[00:10:51] then it's going to be cool for the
[00:10:53] record for those wondering his normal
[00:10:54] attacks are basically the same as jzo
[00:10:56] and the rest of his kit and build and
[00:10:58] team and constellation 2 and everything
[00:11:01] is is Scara he is literally everything
[00:11:04] about him except the fact that he
[00:11:05] consumes HP is Scara you spam normal
[00:11:07] attacks you his C2 you don't need his
[00:11:10] burst every rotation it's not worth
[00:11:11] building ER like Scara unless you have
[00:11:13] C2 which is the same as scaras his
[00:11:15] [ __ ] uh skill is the same as scaras
[00:11:18] his burst is the same as scaras he's
[00:11:20] literally just wander he's literally
[00:11:21] wander but but then with um hazo normal
[00:11:27] attacks
[00:11:31] but okay for people wondering like when
[00:11:33] people are like yo how good is this new
[00:11:35] character usually my mood after having
[00:11:38] played the character is determinant of
[00:11:40] how good they are with nevet I was like
[00:11:42] Overjoyed like it felt like it felt like
[00:11:45] he he came all over me with rizzly it's
[00:11:47] like I'm like cool like he's fun but
[00:11:49] it's not like we'll see you know he's
[00:11:52] okay let's
[00:11:56] pull time for a low energy
[00:12:00] no no no no I don't want cuz I don't
[00:12:02] want to over under hype him so I'm
[00:12:03] trying to wait I'm trying not to say
[00:12:05] anything okay let's go let's pull for
[00:12:07] him we're probably going to get him 80
[00:12:09] out of 80 right now I'm
[00:12:14] oh wait okay for
[00:12:16] the I was going to talk while I pulled
[00:12:19] for the record I'm pretty sure we have
[00:12:21] no like five pity and we're not we're on
[00:12:27] 50/50
[00:12:29] what the [ __ ] yo please please Imagine
[00:12:33] One
[00:12:37] 10 [ __ ] we just lost to 50/50 we're
[00:12:40] getting Chi-Chi
[00:12:41] [Music]
[00:12:43] now it's the Dory curse you literally
[00:12:46] it's objectively impossible
[00:12:48] statistically impossible to win a 50/50
[00:12:50] if dory's in the temple she just curses
[00:12:53] it oh never
[00:12:55] mind hey one deadp what the the
[00:13:00] [ __ ] R
[00:13:02] thei well there you go one Temple we
[00:13:05] save our preo gems for next patch finina
[00:13:08] you're coming
[00:13:11] home dude look at his
[00:13:13] thighs sorry that was a good [ __ ]
[00:13:16] Temple holy
[00:13:27] [ __ ]
[00:13:35] his model's definitely a little bit
[00:13:37] bigger right than like most male models
[00:13:39] we agree right I'm not just coping I
[00:13:40] want to make sure I'm not coping I want
[00:13:41] to make sure this isn't like a genin
[00:13:43] player take he's definitely a little bit
[00:13:44] bigger
[00:13:46] right yes yes
[00:13:50] yes yes he's a little
[00:13:54] thicker yes okay anyways yeah so rli's
[00:13:57] here uh um basically Scara but cryo but
[00:14:02] yeah let's play him that's sick I'm so
[00:14:03] [ __ ] happy holy [ __ ] dude I literally
[00:14:05] pre I was ready to [ __ ] to spend more
[00:14:08] okay cool I don't need the weapon but
[00:14:11] yeah wait single pull on standard I'm oh
[00:14:15] throwing Tails never mind pretty good
[00:14:17] that was the best outcome that's
[00:14:18] probably the best thing you could pull
[00:14:19] on on CER Banner outside of maybe
[00:14:22] Skyward
[00:14:24] harp wait dude Chad Chad Chad
[00:14:27] unironically if I had to choose between
[00:14:29] Skyward harp or no thrilling tales on my
[00:14:31] accounts I probably would pick thrilling
[00:14:33] tals I probably wouldn't pick the harp
[00:14:35] uh I geared my Shang Ling I geared my
[00:14:37] Shena dude okay my Shen's only level 80
[00:14:39] I know I should 90 her but listen I
[00:14:41] didn't realize how good my Shena was the
[00:14:43] only thing I need a bit more of is some
[00:14:44] like dude look at this look at this five
[00:14:45] Lance right best in slot weapon if you
[00:14:47] disagree you're wrong best SL weapon
[00:14:49] look at this 2C so you would go into
[00:14:51] bless in a different team but in Reverse
[00:14:53] melt you don't need a blast look at this
[00:14:55] 16 attack 15 ER and crit raid for fav
[00:14:58] right look at this 21 attack and er 22
[00:15:03] ER on an attack sance a good attack
[00:15:06] goblet no ER but you know crit stats why
[00:15:08] not and then 26 ER and a crit R roll on
[00:15:11] an attack circlet
[00:15:13] dude this is what happens you guys are
[00:15:16] like Pepe doubling me but this is all
[00:15:17] for me trying to build Shia none of this
[00:15:19] was intentional this all came from
[00:15:21] trying to gear Shia I got a good [ __ ]
[00:15:23] does
[00:15:26] does looking none of this was on
[00:15:33] purpose I could go on offside goblet but
[00:15:35] I don't think I need to do I have a
[00:15:36] better
[00:15:37] one wait I don't have an none of my
[00:15:40] attack off have ER what the [ __ ] I have
[00:15:48] this
[00:15:55] anyways C6 Shena question mark
[00:16:00] don't you have spine serent spine is not
[00:16:02] better than fa Lance or Sky spine I mean
[00:16:04] sorry serpent spine is Sky spine
[00:16:07] isn't fa is literally broken if anything
[00:16:10] I would go Vortex I would go Vortex if I
[00:16:12] just wanted attack or engulfing if I
[00:16:15] just wanted her ER and some attack but
[00:16:18] uh Fab is better for my team especially
[00:16:20] CU rizzly it generates one energy every
[00:16:22] 17 years and and Shang Ling and his team
[00:16:25] needs a lot of
[00:16:27] ER
[00:16:29] let's get to
[00:16:31] work yes yes please let's get to work
[00:16:34] please please
[00:16:37] please yeah I'll do my best I want to
[00:16:40] look at his animation in full screen
[00:16:41] let's see started consuming your content
[00:16:43] I've lost every single 50/50 and haven't
[00:16:47] gotten a good artifact give me my luck

[00:17:12] gut

[00:17:20] fast plus three
[00:17:24] beetles remove pet oh we could remove
[00:17:27] the pet
[00:17:30] why is this so loud is this teamc good
[00:17:33] this team is fine I was looking at dude
[00:17:35] I was looking at rizzly Team DPS C you
[00:17:37] know it's a loss of DPS to try to double
[00:17:39] swirl cuz you like can't do it unless
[00:17:41] you like waste 10 years of your life so
[00:17:43] usually only swirl pyro it's pretty
[00:17:47] funny although I guess with guoba you
[00:17:49] might be able to
[00:17:57] but
[00:18:00] Li Bro think he's
[00:18:03] Ru I'm going in I'm not getting use
[00:18:06] strangling I'll use Goa get them
[00:18:09] standle you want me to burst I'll
[00:18:12] just wait no next what's the next
[00:18:15] enemy your use your Char attack no don't
[00:18:19] please stop don't be one of those rizzly
[00:18:21] players I already know I already feel I
[00:18:23] can already feel the
[00:18:26] copium let's talk about his kit let's
[00:18:28] talk about his
[00:18:29] kit I have C1 okay cool you're cool
[00:18:33] let's talk about his kit okay cuz
[00:18:35] something upsets me about him I love
[00:18:37] rley like I really really like him I
[00:18:41] like his voice I like his animations I
[00:18:44] like his build you can play vermil you
[00:18:46] can play Vermilion not even K it's kind
[00:18:48] of [ __ ] because you need energy usually
[00:18:50] if you're C2 it's actually really it's
[00:18:52] like good if you're c0 uh you might you
[00:18:55] have to build ER for ver million which
[00:18:56] isn't great but whatever
[00:18:59] listen we have to talk about something
[00:19:02] this aention thing right it gives you an
[00:19:05] enhanced charge attack when you're under
[00:19:07] 60% HP okay and then this gives you more
[00:19:10] damage it it basically makes you this is
[00:19:13] your your entire kit okay your skill it
[00:19:15] gives you more damage when you're above
[00:19:16] 50% HP but every time you punch it
[00:19:19] drains your your your HP so in an ideal
[00:19:22] world you're always between 60% HP for
[00:19:25] this and 50% for this you're in that
[00:19:27] range 60 above 50 everyone follow
[00:19:30] everyone follow okay the only problem is
[00:19:33] that if you're running a Healer you're
[00:19:35] going to be at 100% or more and if
[00:19:38] you're not running a
[00:19:40] Healer well you're going to be in
[00:19:43] between 50 and 60 but because that's
[00:19:45] kind of how you're like the you can kind
[00:19:47] of manage your HP cuz this drains and
[00:19:49] then this heals but then if you get hit
[00:19:50] by a single enemy at any point you're
[00:19:53] [ __ ] and your skill does no
[00:19:57] damage
[00:20:01] so uh in an Ideal
[00:20:09] World combos drain more than the heal it
[00:20:12] depends what you're doing but yes
[00:20:13] generally yes cuz you only heal 4.5 here
[00:20:18] oh no no sorry sorry sorry what the [ __ ]
[00:20:19] am I saying you only hear uh you heal
[00:20:21] you heal 30 but each punch is 4.5 and
[00:20:23] you're doing like N5 or n yeah cuz you
[00:20:26] can only do this every 2.5 uh every five
[00:20:28] seconds and then this thing lasts for
[00:20:29] [ __ ] 10 so
[00:20:31] it's usually you want a Healer however
[00:20:34] if you have your C1 none of that
[00:20:36] matters and this is probably the biggest
[00:20:39] C1 bait since Hut but I don't know who
[00:20:43] else has needed a C1 this he doesn't
[00:20:46] need the C1 but part of his kit isn't
[00:20:48] real unless you have
[00:20:57] C1
[00:21:00] he's called rith s because he Ros the
[00:21:02] slay try why the [ __ ] did wait Jake

[00:28:25] EDM I will
[00:28:35] okay sorry let's play Let's Play Let's
[00:28:36] play the game let's play the game okay
[00:28:37] so he's already geared got our
[00:28:40] weapon Dr said send the friend request
[00:28:43] again dude I'm sorry I'm sorry he
[00:28:45] probably has 50 out of
[00:28:47] 50 um he's too famous for me wait let's
[00:28:50] see who sends me a friend request let's
[00:28:51] look at Among Us their text is ass let's
[00:28:55] check let's check Among Us is their name
[00:28:56] they have an aaka 2100 attack okay
[00:28:59] amount uh Haron with 33 crit rate on it
[00:29:02] that means you already have a lot of
[00:29:04] crit rate on your IA I want to see no
[00:29:05] crit rate on the artifacts this is
[00:29:06] pretty good this is oh pretty good
[00:29:09] actually there's a lot of attack there
[00:29:10] uh also pretty decent there you're
[00:29:12] looking like you might over cap on crit
[00:29:13] rate but so far so good honestly not bad
[00:29:17] not a bad AA uh you overcap on crit rate
[00:29:19] though a bit too much but you know it is
[00:29:21] what it is Ryden Shogun 1,600 attack is
[00:29:24] concerning but it's fine because you
[00:29:25] have you're probably on like an ER sand
[00:29:27] which is good uh catch that's a good
[00:29:29] flower that's a terrible feather that is
[00:29:31] a decent
[00:29:33] Sands pretty decent
[00:29:38] goblet Opa it's actually
[00:29:45] good
[00:29:48] okay this guy's name is
[00:29:56] book
[00:29:57] but yeah anyways as I was saying before
[00:29:59] I got [ __ ] distracted for like 10
[00:30:01] minutes
[00:30:02] so yes for the most part his passive
[00:30:06] Talent his charge attacks heal him a lot
[00:30:08] but not enough to self- sustain him
[00:30:10] because it can be enough for one
[00:30:12] rotation or if you never get hit
[00:30:14] although his combos are generally HP
[00:30:16] negative but you can play around it if
[00:30:18] you like spend time on other characters
[00:30:19] but then you're wasting time on your
[00:30:21] skills I don't recommend it but
[00:30:22] generally you need a Healer with him and
[00:30:24] if you do need are if you are running a
[00:30:26] Healer then it's hard to be under 60% HP
[00:30:29] basically anytime unless you're running
[00:30:31] like a burst healer like ma or like Jean
[00:30:35] or uh someone like someone on really low
[00:30:38] healing fun fact when I used to speedrun
[00:30:40] with Shia I would run Shia on staff of H
[00:30:43] I would be low HP before 123 and my
[00:30:45] Bennett would have no artifacts except
[00:30:47] he'd be on for no bless plus zero with
[00:30:49] no flower to heal as little as possible
[00:30:51] that true I actually did that but
[00:30:53] anyways so you could do something like
[00:30:56] that if you want like no healing but
[00:30:57] it's kind of in general like I saw
[00:30:59] people like spamming my chat yesterday
[00:31:01] saying how he like you need to charge
[00:31:02] attack on him and I didn't want to say
[00:31:04] anything cuz he wasn't out but now I can
[00:31:05] he's mostly a normal attacker you charge
[00:31:07] attack when you can you mostly normal
[00:31:09] attack unless you have C1 which I think
[00:31:12] makes him a more interesting character a
[00:31:14] stronger character a more fun character
[00:31:16] and has more flexible teams I'm
[00:31:17] definitely going to get C1 I just don't
[00:31:19] know if I'm going to get it now or next
[00:31:20] Banner but I think1 is like it doesn't
[00:31:24] make him broken or anything it's just
[00:31:25] like I feel like he is incomplete as a
[00:31:29] character without C1 that doesn't mean
[00:31:30] he's bad I'm not like I'm just saying a
[00:31:32] big part of his kit is like locked
[00:31:34] behind C1 which I don't think is very
[00:31:37] POG but it is what it is I thought C is
[00:31:40] part of his combo I'm sure the sweatiest
[00:31:42] nlet players uh rizzly players will be
[00:31:44] like yes it is but it's like listen from
[00:31:49] the however much time I've played him
[00:31:51] you are often times going to be able to
[00:31:53] charge attack okay especially the
[00:31:55] current Abyss enemies they kind of [ __ ]
[00:31:56] you up and and tanking hits while you're
[00:31:58] attacking so that you can get a charge
[00:32:00] attack is a good idea you're often times
[00:32:02] going to charge attack it's just it's
[00:32:04] not something you can like really
[00:32:07] plan well you can depending on your
[00:32:09] healer but usually you just do it when
[00:32:10] you
[00:32:14] can
[00:32:17] um with that in
[00:32:20] mind C1 makes him a lot more fun and
[00:32:23] it's a lot of damage C1 gives him uh
[00:32:26] free
[00:32:27] charge attack anytime you do an N5 you
[00:32:29] do nine five normal attacks you get
[00:32:31] enhanced charge attack it also changes
[00:32:33] your damage bonus from like 30 50% more
[00:32:36] I don't know exactly how much where is
[00:32:37] it yeah 50% increase to 200% which is a
[00:32:41] lot uh obviously it's damage bonus but
[00:32:43] you know it's a lot more and it also
[00:32:45] extends your skill
[00:32:48] so pretty
[00:32:51] good with that in mind
[00:32:54] um I want to get his tal to at least
[00:32:57] eight I'm kind of I thought I had
[00:33:10] more sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:33:13] I'm sorry have you no shame Z zos have
[00:33:17] you no shame have you no shame doing
[00:33:19] this in front of a live audience have
[00:33:21] you no shame have you no
[00:33:25] shame I I'm sorry I'm sorry chat I'm
[00:33:28] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
[00:33:30] sorry I'm
[00:33:32] sorry also Leila didn't give me a single
[00:33:35] bonus one and like the 20 I made okay
[00:33:36] now I get one when I don't need it
[00:33:38] thanks
[00:33:41] Lea and then I need some of the green
[00:33:43] ones which I can make boom boom I need
[00:33:46] how many wait blue ones I me I only need
[00:33:47] like two right I'll make three or I'll
[00:33:49] make two
[00:33:54] whatever uh I'll level my
[00:33:57] skill oh my God wait I'm stupid wait am
[00:34:00] I dumb why do I think oh cuz I wanted to
[00:34:02] level this okay sure whatever 877
[00:34:04] whatever it's
[00:34:09] fineos okay so we have a lot to do uh
[00:34:14] our abys is still floor
[00:34:15] eight but it's okay we'll get to test
[00:34:17] him let me do a quick domain run with
[00:34:19] him though just to show off what he do
[00:34:21] and how he
[00:34:25] do
[00:34:30] [Music]
[00:34:31] is z okay without shanai yes so here are
[00:34:34] the two teams I like for him okay I like
[00:34:35] reverse
[00:34:37] melt and I like uh on hit teams this
[00:34:42] last St could be mik could also be an
[00:34:44] anemo character if you're C1 you might
[00:34:45] not need a Healer if you need a Healer
[00:34:47] you could use Yen um I like this team a
[00:34:49] lot cuz a lot of crow carries can't use
[00:34:52] yolon or SRO like AA doesn't really want
[00:34:54] like she can but she doesn't really want
[00:34:55] to G doesn't want to
[00:34:57] uh and even like the like Ka Rosario are
[00:34:59] usually quick swapping but rizzly can
[00:35:01] cuz he's normal attacking so I kind of
[00:35:02] like this team um and then the reverse
[00:35:05] melt is is pretty decent too but the
[00:35:07] thing with the reverse melt is like any
[00:35:08] crowd character works there not just
[00:35:10] rizzly but rizley works there so it's
[00:35:13] like you know yeah uh the main thing uh
[00:35:17] uh that you guys might not know this is
[00:35:19] actually something that might jump scare
[00:35:20] people uh I'm going to show you guys an
[00:35:22] animation you might have never seen
[00:35:24] before and it's something that you
[00:35:25] actually need to do in this team and
[00:35:26] that is holding e on Shena you actually
[00:35:29] hold e in this team you might have never
[00:35:30] you might not even have known that Shena
[00:35:32] can [ __ ] hold e but yeah she can and
[00:35:35] you're supposed to in this team because
[00:35:37] it gives you normal and charge shock
[00:35:38] damage instead of uh burst and
[00:35:44] skill so yeah fun fact Transfiguration
[00:35:51] Transfiguration I always do it LOL okay
[00:35:53] but that's like self-reporting why the
[00:35:56] [ __ ] would you hold on Shen before riz's
[00:35:58] out but yeah I mean I don't want to do
[00:36:00] another rotation but yeah he's basically
[00:36:02] just Scara like look I'll do a charge
[00:36:04] attack here
[00:36:06] actually let me wait for my skill let's
[00:36:09] begin it heals
[00:36:12] you for aaka ah I
[00:36:17] mean that is a little
[00:36:25] copium
[00:36:29] C1 I guess I guess but
[00:36:34] whatever
[00:36:40] yeah Jak ask me what actually are you
[00:36:42] doing right now and I don't know because
[00:36:44] I never know what the [ __ ] I'm doing I
[00:36:46] think we have to do the
[00:36:48] abyss it's been three hours Chop Chop
[00:36:51] streamer man where's the riot SLE
[00:36:55] guy
[00:37:02] okay let me do one more let me do one
[00:37:03] more before we go Abyss we have to do
[00:37:05] Abyss Vin there
[00:37:08] mons I pulled them at 86 but W the 50/50
[00:37:11] at least we won but yeah so I would do
[00:37:13] like hold
[00:37:15] e your energy is like [ __ ] in this
[00:37:17] team so you need to make sure you skill
[00:37:18] with
[00:37:20] everyone or have a lot of er which is
[00:37:22] why I think Shen's best ins slot in this
[00:37:24] team is unironically fa
[00:37:27] there's some teams that are worse not
[00:37:28] like like worse on energy but
[00:37:33] yeah I don't know why I charge attacked
[00:37:35] I just felt like it now I
[00:37:40] can why is he red okay when his HP goes
[00:37:43] under 60 he turns red look well I can't
[00:37:46] get it now right or is he red right now
[00:37:48] I think that he is but yeah whenever
[00:37:51] you're in range to do your enhanced Char
[00:37:53] attack you go red and then it it like it
[00:37:54] tells you I didn't see the animation in
[00:37:56] there but I ass see what
[00:38:00] happened I'm going to show you
[00:38:13] again he is embarrassed he's not
[00:38:17] embarrassed but yeah look so I'll do a
[00:38:19] charge attack so they'll heal me now
[00:38:20] right and I'll let them hit
[00:38:23] me now look I'm going to turn red see
[00:38:26] that means it's back up so if I do it
[00:38:27] again it heals me
[00:38:29] dude see it heals
[00:38:32] me I'm going in do your Master's bidding
[00:38:37] is TR replaceable with yunen um let's
[00:38:41] begin yunen is fine with rizzly I don't
[00:38:44] know if I would replace Shena with her
[00:38:51] um wait did I just miss my Char
[00:38:55] sh but you kind of can you can also play
[00:39:00] kazua or
[00:39:01] jangi or Lila or
[00:39:04] Mika yeah yunen would need like 7
[00:39:06] million ER
[00:39:16] here I'll never play M yo what's wrong
[00:39:20] with ma [ __ ] it we're playing m we're
[00:39:22] playing m we're playing
[00:39:24] m we're playing m
[00:39:27] m m of the nights of
[00:39:31] fonus we're playing
[00:39:35] m your playlist sucks you sucks what now
[00:39:38] yeah what
[00:39:44] now can I use bull light on him no yes
[00:39:47] but no like yes but please
[00:39:55] don't
[00:40:00] proving cover fire providing cover fire
[00:40:09] got do I have another five on my team I
[00:40:11] don't think I do I have to
[00:40:15] wait R I got frozen R quiet game done
[00:40:22] over na are
[00:40:24] CH let's begin
[00:40:30] like this team is good in single Target
[00:40:31] especially I know I'm not bursting but
[00:40:33] like this team is pretty good single
[00:40:34] Target cuz you have yaning t and it
[00:40:36] actually works you can just Perma freeze
[00:40:38] them
[00:40:43] a Here Comes The Catch let me weave you
[00:40:46] a ver know my sword let's keep going
[00:40:52] team I just wasted a whole
[00:40:55] rotation
[00:40:59] most single targets don't freeze though
[00:41:01] yes but honestly okay here's my weird
[00:41:05] take okay don't don't quote me on this
[00:41:07] but I have a weird take where like okay
[00:41:09] normally freeze sucks against bosses but
[00:41:12] like and you would go like mono cryo but
[00:41:15] riz's freeze team is yolan SRO so like
[00:41:18] it doesn't even matter if the boss can't
[00:41:19] be Frozen yolan and Singo are really
[00:41:21] high single 30 damage and then you play
[00:41:23] Mar CH which is like arguably better
[00:41:26] than blizzard stayer cuz sometimes you
[00:41:27] can shatter with blizzard stayer like
[00:41:28] with your charge attacks if you're
[00:41:29] charge attacking um so it's like just go
[00:41:32] M say not blizzard
[00:41:34] Strayer and then you just play yolan
[00:41:38] SRO and then like if you can't freeze
[00:41:41] the enemy you could go something like
[00:41:42] Gene and swirl hydro and then it's kind
[00:41:44] of your other characters carrying not
[00:41:46] your rizzly but still and then if you
[00:41:48] can freeze it's like easy so I actually
[00:41:50] feel like his team's a bit his freeze
[00:41:53] teams are like better in single Target
[00:41:55] than like I wouldn't even recommend
[00:41:57] going [ __ ] monor cryo like who the
[00:41:58] [ __ ] cares about wow I can go [ __ ]
[00:42:01] Shena diona
[00:42:05] wow my sword I okay I'm not even coping
[00:42:08] like I wouldn't be surprised if this
[00:42:10] team is just flat out better DPS than
[00:42:13] that like than the monoc cry one even if
[00:42:15] the enemy can't be
[00:42:23] frozen stay cool face your guil
[00:42:31] the best sheet wise the best sheet team
[00:42:33] was Shena Shang Ling winess the power of
[00:42:38] I don't really see the point of ever
[00:42:39] doing mono cryo I
[00:42:42] mean I don't know you can just go shanak
[00:42:45] Kazo like it's fine shanak Kazo is fine
[00:42:47] if you have C1 you don't need daa even
[00:42:50] if you don't you could run you don't
[00:42:51] need it if you don't need a Healer you
[00:42:53] can if you're running da I feel like the
[00:42:54] team sucks
[00:43:08] anyways just go hyper fridge yes you can
[00:43:12] hyperd is actually not bad but that's
[00:43:14] also F's best

[00:47:54] are you playing Grizzly cuz you're C6 am
[00:47:55] I just getting
[00:47:56] carried maybe I don't have the artifacts
[00:47:59] for him yet oh that's
[00:48:01] awkward yeah wait why don't you just do
[00:48:03] the abyss and then do runs with me oh do
[00:48:05] you want me to go Abyss now I mean I'm
[00:48:08] going to be grinding for a while okay we
[00:48:11] can do that I just chat listen I just
[00:48:13] don't want to feel bad cuz I I tend to
[00:48:15] stall accidentally but okay I'm
[00:48:18] down what we do best first you should
[00:48:20] you should challenge yourself not to
[00:48:21] stall for an entire
[00:48:23] video dude that's impossible
[00:48:26] I I challenge you I don't actually stall
[00:48:29] though it's cuz dude okay people will
[00:48:31] make fun of me if if my damage if my
[00:48:33] damage is not good they'll think the
[00:48:34] character sucks or they'll literally
[00:48:36] [ __ ] talk my entire Heritage so I have
[00:48:38] to make sure all my characters are
[00:48:39] geared which takes a while cuz we don't
[00:48:40] have [ __ ] artifact
[00:48:44] presets yeah I feel you
[00:48:50] okay so what are you going to do I could
[00:48:53] do go I could go do a this then but
[00:48:54] it'll probably take like an hour hour
[00:48:55] cuz I'm going to try like two or three
[00:48:56] teams that's fine okay good luck are you
[00:49:00] doing [ __ ] the the Mari
[00:49:03] Shi uh if that's the best in yeah yeah
[00:49:07] yeah it is you can also use uh REM
[00:49:10] blizzard stayer renessence Vermilion
[00:49:13] Echo bide or twopiece twopiece or
[00:49:15] guilded dreams and melt but uh m is way
[00:49:18] better so
[00:49:22] yeah okay okay go do it bye all right
[00:49:26] it's you he just left again dude why
[00:49:28] doesn't he say bye it's
[00:49:31] fine ha
[00:49:37] was I'm actually going to write down let
[00:49:39] me your notes link down again
[00:49:47] uh I'm writing down that I want to
[00:49:50] mention that for freeze you probably
[00:49:51] still go like blizzard s is technically
[00:49:54] better but some like you're not unless
[00:49:56] you're swapping your free steam against
[00:49:57] enemies that can't be frozen you still
[00:49:59] want to go Mar CH cuz it's like barely
[00:50:02] worse and again it's more consistent cuz
[00:50:04] if the enemy can't be frozen you still
[00:50:05] get all the Buffs so it's probably worth
[00:50:10] mentioning
[00:50:14] okay I just dude the only problem with
[00:50:16] rzz is he kind of steals Net's artifacts
[00:50:18] so now my nevet probably sucks wait
[00:50:21] that's actually fine this is fine yeah
[00:50:24] he's fine he just takes a lot of his
[00:50:26] artifacts
[00:50:27] but yeah like this ciret sucks I I need
[00:50:30] an HP Circ that doesn't suck or goblet I
[00:50:33] guess but
[00:50:39] H
[00:50:54] whatever
[00:50:58] all right nine wait why do I have to do

[01:06:29] okay net will be with fishal Kwa and

[02:04:14] we could use Toma I
[02:04:16] guess I guess yeah I guess I
[02:04:21] guess I should have double as one with
[02:04:25] wind and cl [ __ ] the ti is
[02:04:32] beckon settle
[02:04:36] down not here
[02:04:40] please Wings Of

[02:04:53] father
[02:05:14] Sanctified that's all right the real
[02:05:17] problem would be if we could feel water
[02:05:18] dripping on our heads in the Fortress of
[02:05:21] mared hey he's yeah he's
[02:05:24] okay good
[02:05:26] Lord we could try um before we do
[02:05:29] domains we could try a Toma team I don't
[02:05:31] know if like Tom's geared but I guess it
[02:05:33] doesn't matter we could do like
[02:05:39] rly like MAA or some
[02:05:44] [ __ ] I mean I think we want Bennett and
[02:05:47] I think we want Shena like this is a
[02:05:49] given and then no we could
[02:05:56] do I mean we could do Bennett
[02:06:09] Kaza no way mik mik's okay with
[02:06:17] him
[02:06:27] balls I don't think our to has enough ER
[02:06:29] I mean we could we could try it I
[02:06:33] guess or should we play burning in this
[02:06:41] team we could do the same thing but with
[02:06:43] Thomas if we want like
[02:06:47] this
[02:06:55] burning please okay cuz he said

[02:07:21] moment I thought Rizo was never L for a
[02:07:23] second I pressed e and expected [ __ ]
[02:07:25] balls to show
[02:07:33] up everybody stand back Shar my
[02:07:37] knowledge I'm wasting benit for no

[02:08:16] guy oh ow Benny's Adventure team
[02:08:35] assemble that's all right
[02:08:40] real CH is the weapon uh wi it is fine
[02:08:43] for for melt like it's actually pretty
[02:08:45] decent we just don't have a better
[02:08:47] option
[02:09:01] that's
[02:09:09] righty yourself to home teamwork dream
[02:09:12] workor supporting fire don't get too
[02:09:15] close a moment please
[02:09:27] gr gr grow it
[02:09:31] [Music]
[02:09:34] up can I get my [ __ ] it we're not Nita
[02:09:36] bursting I don't
[02:09:38] care I was trying to get Nita burst but
[02:09:47] whatever
[02:09:53] commit it to
[02:09:55] memory this feels so much worse than
[02:09:57] with chanha
[02:09:59] dude feel so much worse let's light it
[02:10:02] up like I one rotated with
[02:10:07] chanha how is this team better like
[02:10:10] actually how I'm not even I know we
[02:10:11] didn't Nita burst so I guess the I would
[02:10:13] have helped but like we literally one
[02:10:15] rotated it with sheno now this character
[02:10:19] looks [ __ ] Three Star this
[02:10:21] team you got Shang Ling Shang Ling's
[02:10:23] easier to get than [ __ ] Toma C6 which
[02:10:27] is the only reason you're playing him in
[02:10:28] this team because of his C6 we go do you
[02:10:30] know who's easier to get than C6 Toma
[02:10:31] Shang Ling that's going to hurt in the
[02:10:38] morning that's all right you need to
[02:10:40] cancel attacks like are you coping like
[02:10:44] you can do like you can do this and dash
[02:10:46] away but like that's not going to change
[02:10:49] that's going to change the DPS by like
[02:10:51] 1% no okay more than one but like you
[02:10:53] know what I
[02:11:02] mean we could
[02:11:08] try this and then
[02:11:12] Flex maybe Bennett
[02:11:17] actually
[02:11:30] everybody stand back cryo
[02:11:33] incarnate take your
[02:11:35] true Adorn my
[02:11:38] KN
[02:11:44] now someone said Ice Age team
[02:11:50] does that even mean oh our Kaza does not
[02:11:52] his
[02:11:57] burst how do I do this without kazos
[02:12:01] burst
[02:12:06] manifest um I don't actually know what
[02:12:08] to do without our
[02:12:10] bursts team work is true by ordinance
[02:12:14] Divine
[02:12:16] Transfiguration as with wind and Cloud
[02:12:19] stay Co face
[02:12:21] your now we're forward VAP like we're
[02:12:23] melting Bennett which is not ideal this
[02:12:26] still feels better than the last team
[02:12:29] though but yeah let's try to get our
[02:12:31] bursts for when he goes down I want try
[02:12:33] that again that was kind of my
[02:12:37] fault so maybe I don't use bursts here
[02:12:40] or like I do like burst but then
[02:12:43] I the
[02:12:45] bird going in like this maybe there
[02:12:48] should be more
[02:12:51] energy yeah this is
[02:12:54] better wi how why does he dude sometimes
[02:12:57] this guy [ __ ] runs away in two
[02:12:59] seconds other times he takes like a
[02:13:06] year let's light it
[02:13:09] up do your Master's bidding take your
[02:13:12] troop everybody stand fallen leaves
[02:13:16] Adorn
[02:13:22] chill yeah here we're not melting though
[02:13:25] like Bennett's melting or
[02:13:27] Kaza which is not
[02:13:30] great yeah I don't like this team
[02:13:31] without changling I mean maybe you bench
[02:13:34] Shena you probably do shangin Kaza let
[02:13:37] me try
[02:13:39] again maybe Kao let me try
[02:13:46] k
[02:13:49] it could
[02:13:51] do
[02:13:55] like but then it's just the Shena team
[02:13:57] but
[02:13:58] worse wait let me try Shena
[02:14:16] again
[02:14:36] sorry I took too long in Abyss Jake
[02:14:38] started playing Five Nights at Freddy's
[02:14:40] my bad I whatever uh what is this this
[02:14:45] is a chicken right uh I mean what what I
[02:14:48] want to do I know it's the chicken let's
[02:14:49] do okay let's do this Transfiguration
[02:14:52] cryo
[02:14:54] incarnate I'm
[02:14:56] going I pressed three instead of
[02:15:01] [Music]
[02:15:04] two let's light it up I'm going just try
[02:15:07] to get some
[02:15:09] energy
[02:15:14] unleash okay perfect well our five in
[02:15:17] problem
[02:15:18] but oh our sh's on level5 that's why and
[02:15:22] no energy okay let's
[02:15:25] see so we're going to do I mean we
[02:15:27] should start with Shan
[02:15:29] but do your bidd
[02:15:32] team I'm not going to use actually I'm
[02:15:34] going to use
[02:15:46] Goa
[02:15:49] like I know Shang langing is a better
[02:15:51] unit than Toma and [ __ ] but like that
[02:15:52] team is so much faster like that team is
[02:15:56] so much better that actually feels like
[02:15:57] a team like I don't feel bad playing
[02:15:59] that
[02:16:01] team I don't know uh I could try I can
[02:16:05] try
[02:16:11] something let me
[02:16:14] try well first of all Let me give this
[02:16:17] let me try giving Shang
[02:16:19] Ling uh no weapon or like I'll give her
[02:16:23] like level5 like I I'll make her not
[02:16:25] deal damage we'll give her a level one
[02:16:26] weapon is this R1 actually let's give it
[02:16:35] R5 I've tried double Hydra double Hydra
[02:16:37] is not bad double Hydra is okay uh yeah
[02:16:40] I did yolan SRO Mika or yolan SRO Jean
[02:16:44] they're
[02:16:46] fine
[02:16:49] yeah let's try this
[02:16:50] team it's the same team but with like no
[02:16:53] damage on changling well no weapon
[02:17:02] so we'll see if it does
[02:17:06] anything take your true form cryo
[02:17:09] incarnate everybody
[02:17:13] stand do another E on Bennett for energy
[02:17:15] I use my burst
[02:17:19] let's well we're going to break the
[02:17:21] shield at least but I wasted my
[02:17:26] energy it's
[02:17:30] fine that's fine that's
[02:17:33] fine I can Al at the end of rotation
[02:17:35] with rley it's not really like it's not
[02:17:38] a big
[02:17:41] deal okay my will embodied do your
[02:17:45] Master's bidding I'm going in let's
[02:17:48] so higher than de no unit in this team
[02:17:49] is comparable to
[02:17:51] DEA at
[02:18:00] least like
[02:18:03] manifest like we still one rotated it
[02:18:06] and our Shang Ling's on no weapon like
[02:18:08] yeah there's artifacts yeah there's
[02:18:09] Bennett yeah there's Shena but like at
[02:18:11] least that team feels good the other
[02:18:13] teams feel kind of copium well most the
[02:18:15] other teams feel kind of copium at least
[02:18:17] that team feels
[02:18:20] good and it's not hyper Bloom hey hey
[02:18:24] it's not hyper Bloom at least it's not
[02:18:27] hyper
[02:18:28] Bloom cuz I'm sure hyper Bloom feels
[02:18:31] about as good if not
[02:18:46] better
[02:18:51] oh that's actually a decent idea in chat
[02:18:53] we could try Yen
[02:19:01] Sunfire we could try Yen Sunfire that's
[02:19:04] not a bad idea let me let me see what my
[02:19:06] yin's

[02:24:35] smart I have what I need I have the do
[02:24:39] you know what weapon I have on rizzly
[02:24:40] right now I dreamt of child okay that
[02:24:44] what weapon do you have right now wasn't
[02:24:47] an ordinary
[02:24:51] dream child's Vision so you had it with
[02:24:54] you this whole time oh my God wait I
[02:24:56] can't show you right now cuz I'm in the
[02:24:57] middle of the quest but I have the
[02:25:00] dragon spine
[02:25:03] one all right we we have the r in the
[02:25:06] abyss we're going to use him in a Mel
[02:25:07] team again but this time we're not going
[02:25:08] to use Shang Ling cuz Shang Ling you
[02:25:10] know carries every character so we're
[02:25:11] try to not use uh Shang Ling we're going
[02:25:13] to play Shena benett and uh let's say uh
[02:25:17] who are we playing who are we playing CH
[02:25:18] I can't remember we were playing on Jean
[02:25:20] Jean Sunfire we cooked we cooked we
[02:25:22] cooked we cooked where's Sunfire there
[02:25:24] she is okay uh second off uh second off
[02:25:27] we're GNA do uh second off we're gonna
[02:25:30] do nevet we're gonna play the same Dem I
[02:25:32] I like Shia we could play he them
[02:25:34] actually it's been a
[02:25:36] while wait the song's a
[02:25:45] Bop
[02:25:48] isn't changling a free character yeah
[02:25:50] but I don't want there to only be one
[02:25:51] team so I think okay here's my current
[02:25:54] take on RZ Ley I think as a unit he
[02:25:56] feels kind of whatever he's kind of mid
[02:25:58] but I think he has some teams where he's
[02:25:59] pretty decent and I think those teams
[02:26:01] are either Shang Ling or double Hydro
[02:26:05] MAA felt
[02:26:07] okay but that team You could argue is
[02:26:09] just SRO yolan carrying so you know and
[02:26:12] then this one might be another team and
[02:26:15] then hyper fridge is fine but hyper
[02:26:16] fridge I don't like the best team being
[02:26:18] hyper blo with a crowd character cuz
[02:26:20] that just makes the character feel worse
[02:26:21] than they
[02:26:24] are which is why this team that doesn't
[02:26:26] need changling if it can actually
[02:26:27] perform
[02:26:30] well is is pretty good it's good for for
[02:26:32] R
[02:26:40] clearers are in those teams always going
[02:26:42] to be better off using someone else I
[02:26:44] think he is comparable to other units in
[02:26:46] those teams I don't think he's just like
[02:26:48] a a downgrade I don't think he's an
[02:26:50] upgrade I don't think he's a downgrade
[02:26:51] like in a lot of the Mel teams it's like
[02:26:54] okay let's say the hydro teams with
[02:26:55] yolan Cho like y like aaka guu stuff
[02:26:59] like that don't really want to use the
[02:27:01] auto attacking supports as
[02:27:04] much there's no reason not to use the
[02:27:06] Shang Ling no I
[02:27:07] agree but Sunfire dream's more
[02:27:15] fun
[02:27:24] unleash byin Divine going
[02:27:29] in oh I should it's not too late I guess
[02:27:34] whatever it's fine this is not like the
[02:27:36] damage rotation anyways we're just
[02:27:37] trying to break the shield so
[02:27:45] whatever
[02:27:47] that's fine did we got our bursts no we
[02:27:55] didn't son we're about to get them watch
[02:27:57] we're going to get every single burst in
[02:27:58] the

[03:15:24] them cryo
[03:15:26] incarnate now 105k without even an
[03:15:29] empowered charge
[03:15:34] attack holy
[03:15:37] [ __ ] our Shang Ling has no weapon by the
[03:15:41] way
[03:15:54] better without two on yeah I mean I
[03:15:56] don't know like he's pretty mid but like
[03:16:00] I don't know this is one team where he
[03:16:02] actually feels
[03:16:04] good in my opinion I think he's actually
[03:16:06] pretty good in this
[03:16:08] team but reverse mouth quick reverse
[03:16:10] mouth has always been like my favorite
[03:16:12] team
[03:16:13] I think reverse melt with like I think
[03:16:15] like reverse melt quick swap with Kaa is
[03:16:17] is like really good I think this te is
[03:16:19] decent
[03:16:41] too
[03:16:54] I think longterm this might be a bad
[03:16:56] take cuz I don't think we should
[03:16:58] normalize characters with whose kits
[03:17:00] feel incomplete at c0 however I think
[03:17:03] longterm everyone that actually plays
[03:17:04] Grizzly is going to eventually get C1 at
[03:17:06] some rerun at some point cuz C1 is
[03:17:08] pretty uh lifestyle changing it's kind
[03:17:11] of like Hut like obviously there's CZ
[03:17:14] Hut players and she's good at like she's
[03:17:15] pretty decent at CZ but it's like at
[03:17:17] this point like I feel like there's more
[03:17:19] C1 Hut and czo
[03:17:29] huta and Hut isn't I yeah I also think I
[03:17:33] also I
[03:17:38] mean yeah yeah it's also like more
[03:17:42] important for
[03:17:44] rly not necessarily more important like
[03:17:47] you can but it's like a different play
[03:17:49] style completely who c z you you need a
[03:17:52] shield and you need to jump cancel
[03:17:54] versus Dash cancel and shield is fine
[03:17:56] but you don't need it as much
[03:17:57] anymore rizzly without it is normal
[03:18:00] attack spam rizzly with it you can
[03:18:02] actually have charge ATT
[03:18:04] combos so it's like and you don't
[03:18:07] necessarily need a Healer
[03:18:09] anymore it's not like what are you
[03:18:11] saying yes it is it's not the same Hut
[03:18:13] is less dependent on it but it's in it's
[03:18:16] the same in the sense of certain
[03:18:19] characters c1s basically everyone who Ms
[03:18:22] them gets it after a certain not
[03:18:23] everyone but like uh uh like more than
[03:18:27] half of the people that M them get it
[03:18:28] eventually with like reruns and [ __ ] I
[03:18:30] think rizley is going to be like
[03:18:33] that like veny dude venty has like the
[03:18:38] worst C1 in the do you know what venty
[03:18:40] C1 does it literally it does
[03:18:43] nothing I don't even know why I have
[03:19:11] it
[03:19:30] have you ever seen any stickers on my
[03:19:31] back do me a favor and take them off
[03:19:33] malines like to play pranks
[03:19:37] sometimes okay I was
[03:19:41] down
[03:19:44] Transfiguration Advent let's light it up
[03:19:46] everybody eat
[03:19:49] this binance Divine N Net doesn't need a
[03:19:53] C1 net only needs a C1 if you can't
[03:19:58] Dodge like net signature is better than
[03:20:00] a C1 for like a lot of a lot of the time
[03:20:04] not always like if you have like R5 sack
[03:20:06] Jade which is impossible right now but
[03:20:09] usually it
[03:20:10] is
[03:20:12] I would basically never get rli's weapon
[03:20:14] over a C1 even if I mean okay that's not
[03:20:17] really true cuz it could be better
[03:20:20] DPS but even if it is I would I still
[03:20:31] wouldn't so then you have it I have
[03:20:40] both like I'm using whith right now but
[03:20:43] like I have his weapon I have c one I
[03:20:45] just didn't I'm not using
[03:20:49] them new let C1 means he always shining
[03:20:53] pretty I pulled C1 of this cryo
[03:20:58] incarnate let's light it up
[03:21:01] going is isn't the main thing it's
[03:21:03] Improvement on his passive if if that
[03:21:04] was the case well like yes that's like
[03:21:07] the zff take but if that was the case
[03:21:09] then why would you get it over his
[03:21:10] weapon cuz normally the weapons a bigger
[03:21:12] increase unless you have like uh a high
[03:21:15] refin Jade everybody do your Master's
[03:21:19] bidd get
[03:21:35] them Spotlight
[03:21:40] moonlight
[03:21:44] your free to play would you pull for
[03:21:45] rizley I wouldn't recommend him if
[03:21:46] you're free to play but I am biased
[03:21:49] towards liking characters that look like
[03:21:51] him so maybe like I think he looks
[03:21:53] really cool so I might get
[03:21:55] him but um he's very like he's he is
[03:22:00] replaceable like you can use basically
[03:22:02] any crowd character here you don't need
[03:22:04] him but if you want to use them there's
[03:22:06] teams where you can perform
[03:22:08] decent he's uh yeah he has like the
[03:22:11] normal like the the the main DP the
[03:22:13] replaceable main DPS
[03:22:18] syndrome but I think he's cool I like
[03:22:20] him I just uh I wish his C1 was part of
[03:22:23] his kit that's my main complaint with
[03:22:33] him cryo wander I mean he built he's
[03:22:36] built and mostly played like
[03:22:40] wander
[03:22:42] his C2 is the same his burst is the same
[03:22:46] his his e is the [ __ ]
[03:23:10] same
[03:23:15] he is more Caked Up I literally can't
[03:23:17] even
[03:23:18] re I have one resin I have one resin and
[03:23:22] 10 Primo gems how

[03:37:03] worry I love Ki
[03:37:09] never oh okay I don't
[03:37:12] know how to feel now uh my guide is
[03:37:15] mostly done I recorded all of it but
[03:37:16] there's a few things I want to add like
[03:37:18] notably I'll write down with's on my
[03:37:20] notepad
[03:37:24] um uh I want to point out that when he's
[03:37:26] glowing red you can charge tack cuz I
[03:37:28] forgot to say that also uh I think
[03:37:32] Sunfire is a decent team and I also
[03:37:33] think I only like him in like three
[03:37:36] teams um but that's fine I
[03:37:39] guess
[03:37:46] I do think C1 makes them feel like a
[03:37:48] different character but we will we'll
[03:37:50] activate c one later we'll
[03:37:53] see what are the
[03:37:56] teams okay so there's reverse
[03:38:00] melt with it's like this and then Flex
[03:38:03] Shen's technically replaceable but I
[03:38:05] don't like replacing chanha but you can
[03:38:09] um
[03:38:11] double Hydro yoling tro which is decent
[03:38:14] you could also use Kaza here all right
[03:38:17] let's head off but yeah it's like okay
[03:38:20] this team is not like my favorite but
[03:38:21] it's a good way to use onfield
[03:38:23] characters with a cryo cuz most cryos
[03:38:27] can't uh obviously like fridge hyper
[03:38:30] fridge is is you
[03:38:32] know it's always going to work because
[03:38:34] you can like freeze hyper bloom all that
[03:38:37] and then uh burnmouth is okay but I'm
[03:38:39] not the big like burn
[03:38:41] mou I can see why it would be good I
[03:38:44] just don't really like
[03:38:49] it and you can obviously moo cryo too
[03:38:51] but I
[03:38:59] don't yo Pro it's the year appreciate it
[03:39:02] been watching since
[03:39:04] one now for a year cheers to more
[03:39:07] streams and variety maybe um
[03:39:12] chat can you pleas sheno with the
[03:39:14] Rosaria
[03:39:17] yeah you
[03:39:26] [Music]
[03:39:32] can what are other people playing let me
[03:39:36] see comps melt freeze cryo burn melt oh
[03:39:42] that's it that's the only four they
[03:39:44] recommend
[03:39:55] okay toer hold E when using Grizzly
[03:40:08] hold yeah I mean I suspect whatever
[03:40:11] fina's kit is might probably like make
[03:40:13] sense with font characters like Grizzly
[03:40:16] but we'll
[03:40:21] see you think his current best team is
[03:40:23] this one this
[03:40:28] one like we cleared we like I'm pretty
[03:40:30] sure we like one phase the
[03:40:32] [ __ ] 121 and like even with like with
[03:40:35] our shling not geared he still
[03:40:39] performs we one phed it with Sunfire
[03:40:41] like with this but with a genan
[03:41:00] instead
[03:41:04] yeah um I might try to mention Shan her
[03:41:06] Replacements a
[03:41:09] more
[03:41:11] what about yolan he works with yolan I
[03:41:13] wouldn't play that in this team but yeah
[03:41:16] you could do this didn't domain run with
[03:41:19] Jake sag yeah I feel bad I wish I did I
[03:41:21] didn't know he was going so fast I got
[03:41:39] stuck
[03:41:53] [ __ ] is putsy let's
[03:41:59] begin called me lovely
[03:42:02] one oh [ __ ] we got
[03:42:08] Bells
[03:42:38] balls
[03:42:52] okay okay yeah that's all I'm going to
[03:42:54] do for today I think uh I'm leaving for
[03:42:56] twitch on Thursday which is tragic but
[03:42:59] that I that means I think I'm going to
[03:43:00] end I'm going to stream again tomorrow
[03:43:01] before I leave so I'll try to stream
[03:43:02] tomorrow if I can if I can't I'm sorry
[03:43:04] but I really will try to at least for a
[03:43:06] little bit um rly guide should be out
[03:43:09] either tonight or early tomorrow it's
[03:43:11] looking like early tomorrow
[03:43:14] um yeah so expect that uh with that in
[03:43:18] mind I love you guys rizle is rizzly uh
[03:43:21] do you guys yeah
[03:43:26] okay also chat are we 100% sure his
[03:43:34] um actually
[03:43:38] yeah never mind I was thinking about
[03:43:40] like combos where he might not need a
[03:43:42] Healer but like it doesn't matter cuz
[03:43:44] the more rotations you do the lower
[03:43:45] you're going to start and then you get
[03:43:46] hit by a random enemy and then
[03:43:51] yeah spam CA is good his charge ATT
[03:43:53] costs 50
[03:43:55] stamina look at
[03:44:08] this also when you're under 50% HP you
[03:44:11] generate no particles yeah true forgot
[03:44:14] about
[03:44:16] that oh
[03:44:22] yeah okay good good spot to end on I do
[03:44:25] like the character a lot but I think
[03:44:27] there's like some things that uh like I
[03:44:30] wish C1 was just part of his kit but it
[03:44:32] is what it is I still like him he's kind
[03:44:34] of whatever like he's
[03:44:36] decent but you need to have a good team
[03:44:38] and know how to build him so so um and I
[03:44:41] don't like him in like every team I like
[03:44:42] him in some teams only with that in mind
[03:44:46] we are now going to go
[03:44:48] from sweaty rizzly stream to rating
[03:44:53] um how do I say this nicely a very
[03:44:56] talented person however their talent
[03:44:59] doesn't come in the form of Abyss
[03:45:01] clearing okay it's different Talent it's
[03:45:03] it's like it's like a grass
[03:45:07] toucher so we're going to raid our local
[03:45:09] for reang who is currently I think doing
[03:45:12] the archon quest I don't know but
[03:45:14] they're in a m outfit so we're going to
[03:45:16] read them [ __ ] it what are they doing is
[03:45:19] there anything else
[03:45:21] uh second now hold on hold on hold on
[03:45:23] hold on hold on hold on hold has there
[03:45:26] already been three two hours two three
[03:45:30] hours can't even drown in font in what
[03:45:32] are we they so wait they might be ending
[03:45:34] I don't know doesn't matter get in here
[03:45:36] uh thanks for watching I love you guys
[03:45:38] I'll try to give you guys more thoughts
[03:45:40] about rizzly in the guide cuz I want to
[03:45:42] record a part of me talking about it and
[03:45:43] maybe tomorrow but for now if you're
[03:45:45] wondering if you like them get them use
[03:45:47] them as a DPS but um I think he feels a
[03:45:50] lot better at
[03:46:00] C1 we'll see
[03:46:05] though is C2 any good it's the same as
[03:46:07] wander basically it's decent it's a it
[03:46:10] makes his burst a lot better it's not
[03:46:12] needed but it's decent C1 is like the
[03:46:14] really good
[03:46:16] one c2's okay if you want it make his
[03:46:19] burst better go ahead but
[03:46:27] yeah his C6 yo Am I Wrong by the way his
[03:46:30] C6 looks insane for speedr running with
[03:46:31] like chanha looks really
[03:46:36] good anyways there's watch d That's the
[03:46:40] it is yeah that's what I thought okay
[03:46:41] about to start be nice bye
[03:46:48] [Music]
