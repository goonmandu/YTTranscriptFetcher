[00:10:42] you um I love birds Hello Kaza welcome
[00:10:46] to the
[00:10:50] stream how are you doing
[00:10:54] today birds
[00:10:58] come
[00:11:02] anyways welcome to the stream I love you
[00:11:04] chat no not parasocial uh we have a lot
[00:11:07] to do a lot to talk about
[00:11:10] first um should we start with this we'll
[00:11:12] start with this okay someone said check
[00:11:15] your Tik Tok comments and that
[00:11:17] aggravated me it applied dendro to my
[00:11:20] Electro and then another Electro because
[00:11:22] that would have just been quickened so
[00:11:24] you have to uh in order to aggravate you
[00:11:25] have to dentro Electro but then after
[00:11:27] that you have to Electro again so
[00:11:28] anyways so that aggravated me because
[00:11:31] first of all YouTube shorts doing great
[00:11:34] thanks for watching them reposted them
[00:11:36] on Tik Tok recently Allan did our
[00:11:38] editor doing
[00:11:41] well but because Tik Tok is objectively
[00:11:44] the most dog [ __ ] platform creatorwise
[00:11:47] just objectively you can't even
[00:11:49] argue uh a few things first of all our
[00:11:53] [ __ ] videos are ineligible for the
[00:11:54] for you for you page because it's
[00:11:57] lowquality content
[00:11:59] S I think it thinks we're a clip Channel
[00:12:02] That's reposting and it's like flagging
[00:12:04] it cuz it sees it on YouTube already I
[00:12:06] don't know but B so Allan I was like so
[00:12:08] we've been trying to figure out how to
[00:12:10] fix this Al's like bro you might get
[00:12:12] banned if I keep posting do you want to
[00:12:13] make a new account I don't want to make
[00:12:15] a new account if we have to maybe we
[00:12:18] will but hopefully we don't uh also it
[00:12:22] won't let me change my region to the US
[00:12:24] even though he's it's like his account
[00:12:25] kind of and or it's ours but he's
[00:12:27] us-based
[00:12:29] and apparently if you do it in the US
[00:12:31] there's like a monetization thing
[00:12:33] because shorts make no money but if you
[00:12:34] do it in the US they do and then I could
[00:12:35] give more money to him because I want to
[00:12:37] pay my editor I mean I do pay them
[00:12:39] anyways but you know if the shorts make
[00:12:41] more money you could take a whatever 50%
[00:12:43] or however the [ __ ] anyways doesn't
[00:12:44] matter but so I don't know what the
[00:12:46] [ __ ] happening I'm trying to see if I
[00:12:48] know someone there if not I'll just I
[00:12:51] don't I don't care I don't run it but I
[00:12:53] would rather it work so anyways
[00:12:57] um we we'll see um so
[00:13:03] yeah that's what it
[00:13:05] is anyways well I'm out of water we have
[00:13:09] literally no water oh
[00:13:12] my they resets in five oh my god do I
[00:13:15] have
[00:13:16] Cliffhanger I don't it's fine it's fine
[00:13:18] whatever wait let me go get
[00:13:27] water
[00:13:43] water yeah you better [ __ ] scatter
[00:13:45] real fast you didn't have time to
[00:13:46] assemble [ __ ] scatter away anyways
[00:13:51] also clarification I said Tik Tok worst
[00:13:54] platform for creators okay in terms of
[00:13:56] like commenters and one guys Twitter
[00:13:58] might be worse it's up there um I still
[00:14:02] think quote tweets are one of the worst
[00:14:03] war crimes ever committed whoever
[00:14:05] invented that deserves jail time I'm not
[00:14:07] even joking not in game in real life if
[00:14:09] you invented the quote tweet you should
[00:14:10] be behind bars it is what it is it is
[00:14:13] what it is I'm sorry it is what it is it
[00:14:15] just is what it is but anyways
[00:14:20] um uh yeah so here what it is it's so
[00:14:24] funny don't talk to
[00:14:27] me
[00:14:34] I mean they are some of them are but
[00:14:36] it's so I don't know dude it literally
[00:14:39] turns the website into
[00:14:43] PVP whatever that's fine I
[00:14:47] guess dude my hair is not hairing I have
[00:14:51] too much hair I need to [ __ ] shave it
[00:14:53] whatever uh welcome to the Stream So a
[00:14:55] few things a few
[00:14:56] things watching your streams feel feels
[00:14:59] like getting
[00:15:01] ratioed anyways uh so the things I want
[00:15:04] to talk about one Abyss forms are out in
[00:15:06] the Discord if you want to watch uh if
[00:15:07] you want to submit your stuff uh your
[00:15:09] Clips account reforms will be
[00:15:12] later the lantern right which forar
[00:15:14] should you pick video is done I just
[00:15:15] haven't recorded tank fave or Shield
[00:15:17] fave footage so we're going to do that
[00:15:20] today and I recorded the whole n guide I
[00:15:23] just need a he footage then tomorrow I'm
[00:15:24] going to be recording Cloud retainer
[00:15:25] stuff but she's not out so how about I
[00:15:27] know I don't know we're going to wait
[00:15:28] but when she's out I'll record stuff I
[00:15:30] mean I can don't talk to me but we're
[00:15:31] going to pre-record some stuff and then
[00:15:33] we'll see when she's out well a bit
[00:15:35] before she's out but for now all I know
[00:15:36] is the pre-record stuff so we'll see Suk
[00:15:42] but that's what's happening
[00:15:45] um for a more serious point we're going
[00:15:49] to be co- streaming the 2.0 Star live
[00:15:51] stream which is whatever like that's
[00:15:53] cool but every time we co- stream either
[00:15:56] genin or Star rail we get you get more
[00:15:58] viewers which is great there's also a
[00:16:01] lot of random people like okay
[00:16:02] everyone's welcome but chat is always
[00:16:05] out of control so ideally behave chat
[00:16:08] okay mods I'm sorry to Vance I'm just
[00:16:10] saying behave because I've noticed that
[00:16:13] every time there's a live there's people
[00:16:15] that make jokes they shouldn't and while
[00:16:18] I am a very tolerant
[00:16:21] streamer jokes of that nature will not
[00:16:25] be tolerated and you will probably be
[00:16:26] permabanned and by of that nature we
[00:16:29] mean Crescent pikee no Crescent Pike
[00:16:33] jokes and if you still don't know what I
[00:16:36] mean I'm talking about [ __ ] claraa
[00:16:37] Nita Bao stop it those were our entire
[00:16:40] unan Quest last time it was just that
[00:16:44] we're not we don't welcome that look
[00:16:47] just a reminder that it has been a year
[00:16:49] since ZX announced I don't get it well
[00:16:52] for some reason
[00:16:55] ring let's just say when Jeff was
[00:16:58] mathing Crescent Pike in 1.0 he used an
[00:17:01] abbreviation for the weapon and I said
[00:17:02] please never type that again and since
[00:17:05] then we don't abbreviate Cresent Pike
[00:17:08] love your streams we don't abbreviate
[00:17:19] it yes five
[00:17:22] months P 14 of the three just a reminder
[00:17:26] Elden ring when
[00:17:29] but
[00:17:32] yeah I'm so confused it's just I do have
[00:17:36] to spell it out to you people make weird
[00:17:38] jokes about like Children characters and
[00:17:39] I don't want to Harbor that so it's just
[00:17:41] a warning that anyone that makes that
[00:17:43] will be banned as they have been in the
[00:17:45] past but I feel like it always happens
[00:17:46] more during like preview streams for
[00:17:48] some reason I think it's because there's
[00:17:49] more people that aren't from the like
[00:17:52] Community I don't
[00:17:55] know what you think of new star five
[00:17:57] stars very Bo and then very cocka next
[00:17:59] patch but in terms of gameplay wait till
[00:18:02] they're out but Sparkle's Harmony so
[00:18:04] that probably instantly going to be good
[00:18:07] the odds of them releasing a Bad Harmony
[00:18:09] character is like one like 3% I mean no
[00:18:12] maybe not three we'll see we'll see
[00:18:15] we'll
[00:18:16] see maybe clueless maybe
[00:18:19] clueless maybe
[00:18:26] clueless anyways any voice crack whoa
[00:18:29] anyways so that's the plan um
[00:18:33] also okay so I don't even know if I need
[00:18:36] to talk about this but I'm going to
[00:18:37] because I like just talking to you guys
[00:18:39] about things I was going to stream the
[00:18:40] 2.0 live stream and then the star real
[00:18:42] team reached out like yo do you want to
[00:18:43] stream the 2.0 live stream and I was
[00:18:45] like oh yeah haha and so nobody tell
[00:18:48] them that I was going to anyways so when
[00:18:50] we watch it I'm going to put hashtag ad
[00:18:51] in the title but I don't have to do
[00:18:52] anything or say anything so if it's dog
[00:18:54] [ __ ] I can still tell you guys it's dog
[00:18:55] [ __ ] but um yeah so
[00:18:59] that but yeah so apparently that's the
[00:19:01] thing so that's cool um but shout out to
[00:19:03] them they're cool
[00:19:05] corpa um but I'm only telling you guys
[00:19:08] this cuz I don't want to like not say it
[00:19:10] but also I don't have to do anything or
[00:19:12] say anything so that's cool anyways um
[00:19:17] you never say anything's dog [ __ ] de's
[00:19:19] dog [ __ ] no she got better with the
[00:19:20] Vette so maybe I am wrong who is
[00:19:22] objectively dog [ __ ] okay DEA is though
[00:19:24] cuz like even everyone in the's good oh
[00:19:28] but the Jeff's going to like write a
[00:19:29] thesis on how de's good aloy yeah aloy
[00:19:32] is dog
[00:19:34] [ __ ] Dory
[00:19:38] okay look you know how much I hate
[00:19:42] Dory
[00:19:44] however no she is bad yeah she is
[00:19:48] bad she she's bad but like what if you
[00:19:50] don't have cookie and you don't have
[00:19:52] Fishel and you can't play a team that
[00:19:53] isn't hyper blo and you don't have bet
[00:19:56] with sucros actually you don't have
[00:19:57] sucros in general and you don't have um
[00:20:01] uh SRO and then you're like oh well I
[00:20:09] need oh yeah I saw some things also
[00:20:11] about
[00:20:13] like ya Yao Dory Barbara freeto play and
[00:20:17] then like the last slot I forget who the
[00:20:19] last slot was and it like cleared a bis
[00:20:20] 12 but anyways cuz Dory was given for
[00:20:23] free I think like a few patches ago
[00:20:27] anyways that's not
[00:20:30] possible traveler maybe I don't remember
[00:20:32] I think it was Double D I'm pretty sure
[00:20:34] you need more well you need more D than
[00:20:35] just ya ya on that team so it's probably
[00:20:37] like colay or traveler probably traveler
[00:20:40] anyways welcome to the stream that's
[00:20:42] everything I need to say in the intro um
[00:20:46] also I wanted to talk to you guys about
[00:20:48] what I did off stream uh I'm not going
[00:20:50] to turn my face cam on for this so you
[00:20:52] can't k w but I've noticed that while
[00:20:55] some of my characters are incredible
[00:20:57] amazing geared they could literally they
[00:20:59] could literally they could they could
[00:21:01] I'm going to say they could Peg you they

[00:21:18] up whatever it doesn't matter anyways

[00:21:22] noticed I have maybe like 10 to like 15
[00:21:25] Chara no I'd say like 20 total
[00:21:27] characters that I actually play that are
[00:21:29] actually like pretty well geared right
[00:21:30] that are
[00:21:31] usable but I want to play the other ones
[00:21:33] too so I've been on a quest to ascend

[00:21:58] also pre- farmed links so we can have a
[00:22:00] four-star healer for fourar clears I
[00:22:02] also lowkey prearm shy a little bit but
[00:22:04] I pre- farmed links look so I have 74 of
[00:22:07] these so I can fully Ascend her uh we
[00:22:08] got a bunch of
[00:22:10] mats uh so I'm basically prepping it to
[00:22:13] where cuz here's my thing I have pretty
[00:22:15] good knowledge when it comes to the
[00:22:16] characters I play or that are like meta
[00:22:19] I know who's good I know the teams that
[00:22:20] are good I know how to build them for
[00:22:21] the most part but there's a lot of
[00:22:22] characters that I don't know because
[00:22:23] I've never used so I want to level them
[00:22:25] so that I know them the only character
[00:22:27] that's like really good that I haven't
[00:22:28] played is QQ and the ones I don't have
[00:22:31] like I haven't played I don't have
[00:22:32] claraa but
[00:22:35] anyways
[00:22:36] anyways prearm released character om
[00:22:39] don't talk to me I didn't I meant to say
[00:22:42] okay I said pre-farm but [ __ ] you man
[00:22:46] play yukong I have but I hate her but
[00:22:48] but then the yukong Defenders like oh my
[00:22:50] God she's actually so good if you speed
[00:22:52] tun and then get idolon and then
[00:22:53] everything lines up don't talk to me I I
[00:22:56] don't like when I have have to use my
[00:22:58] brain
[00:23:02] okay I'm only going to say this when my
[00:23:05] face cam is off because if this gets
[00:23:07] clipped with my face cam my reputation
[00:23:09] will be ruined however when I play a
[00:23:12] character like
[00:23:14] yukong it is difficult for me to
[00:23:18] have brain power that is disposable to
[00:23:23] be used towards uh uh uh uh uh uh
[00:23:28] uh turn I want to say like speed meta
[00:23:31] tuning but that's like before the battle
[00:23:32] so I don't even know what I'm like

[00:29:46] [Music]
[00:29:54] trailer they were often too advanc daned
[00:29:57] for
[00:29:59] me but they always showed me how much
[00:30:01] she cared that's pretty
[00:30:05] [Music]
[00:30:08] cute oh you want to hear a story about
[00:30:13] master yo that looks good Master might
[00:30:16] say she likes peace and quiet but she
[00:30:19] doesn't mind getting visitors on Mount
[00:30:21] Out song In Truth she does get lonely if
[00:30:26] no one ever goes to see
[00:30:30] her what shut help Cloud retainer you
[00:30:34] say yes I know a tale or
[00:30:38] two there was a time when she preferred
[00:30:41] to appear in human form and was revered
[00:30:44] as a bold and decisive figure really a
[00:30:48] we've never seen her in that form before
[00:30:51] I mean we're about
[00:30:53] [Music]
[00:30:55] to Yo low key before we see her face cuz
[00:30:58] Okay one sec okay before we see her face
[00:31:01] I literally dude I think this color
[00:31:02] palette is so sick I know this is just
[00:31:04] like an Nemo simping right now I think
[00:31:06] this color palad is
[00:31:07] [Music]
[00:31:12] sick okay dude Chad what's her eye color
[00:31:20] fast okay wait she did the
[00:31:23] [Music]
[00:31:26] Ula
[00:31:28] who speaks about one behind one's
[00:31:31] back not to worry I'm sure you will have
[00:31:34] the chance to very
[00:31:36] soon bro look at the
[00:31:39] preview why did they do that why did
[00:31:41] they do that why did
[00:31:44] they dude they always do this it's like
[00:31:47] when s Cho was first introduced to the
[00:31:49] story I remember I was like 12 he
[00:31:50] literally they the literally first time
[00:31:52] play I wasn't even streaming this is
[00:31:54] like the start of genin they they they
[00:31:56] introduced they pan him legs up I was
[00:31:59] like oh who's this boom I sing
[00:32:01] CH they always do this with
[00:32:03] [Music]
[00:32:05] characters like what is
[00:32:06] [Music]
[00:32:16] this she's cool
[00:32:18] though um very excited for her because
[00:32:23] she will very clearly enable
[00:32:26] Plunge did they write more about what
[00:32:28] exactly she does let me pull up Twitter
[00:32:30] Twitter cuz I saw the post so I didn't
[00:32:31] read them because I usually don't read
[00:32:33] the like character demo
[00:32:42] stuff um
[00:32:45] o is this
[00:32:47] it helal skill can be used up to three
[00:32:50] times consecutive leaves plunging
[00:32:52] attacks will be converted yeah uh burst
[00:32:54] summons a mechanism which heals all
[00:32:56] party
[00:32:59] members adap assistance also increases
[00:33:01] the jump height of all party members
[00:33:03] with punch attack and additional anemo
[00:33:05] aligned follow up they added followup
[00:33:12] attacks additionally her Talent will
[00:33:14] increase nearby active characters
[00:33:16] plunging attack shock wave damage based
[00:33:19] on her attack when adep assistance
[00:33:21] Stacks are
[00:33:22] present
[00:33:25] so for once chat no more porn
[00:33:31] acting what this
[00:33:33] means is the following first of all her
[00:33:37] burst can enable plunging characters
[00:33:40] that otherwise wouldn't plunge second
[00:33:42] she heals which means at worst she's a
[00:33:45] gene third of all she increases the
[00:33:48] plunging attack shock wave damage based
[00:33:50] on her attack we have to see how this
[00:33:53] works uh it is safe for me to assume
[00:33:57] that it might work similarly to a shha
[00:33:59] but for plunge but how would I know we
[00:34:02] have to see this is just based on the
[00:34:05] wording if that is true this might be
[00:34:09] good for Shia and if it is then that's
[00:34:12] great because as it stands right now one
[00:34:14] of Shia's best teams competitive as his
[00:34:16] best team is Shia farzon finina and then
[00:34:21] a Healer either Jean or Bennett Jean is
[00:34:24] like technically the best but Bennett
[00:34:26] gives a lot of attack
[00:34:27] and if you have enough healing can be
[00:34:29] really good potentially
[00:34:30] better so if this character gives enough
[00:34:34] healing why is her birthday 4 foot 11
[00:34:37] it's not dude anyways so if if if she
[00:34:41] does all of that and give you plunge
[00:34:42] damage then she might be really good for
[00:34:44] sha and that is great and I can't
[00:34:48] wait and we will make a new Shia video
[00:34:51] if that happens probably a new Shia
[00:34:53] guide and a new Shia
[00:34:55] gameplay now something that that I want
[00:34:57] to keep in mind that I want to uh
[00:35:04] emphasize is that if her buff we don't
[00:35:07] know how her buff works we don't but
[00:35:10] don't porn acting me if her buff works
[00:35:13] the exact same way that shanal quills
[00:35:16] work we don't know if they do okay I'm
[00:35:19] being honest I don't know if they do cuz
[00:35:21] she's not out I assume they might given
[00:35:24] the
[00:35:25] wording
[00:35:32] however cuz Okay look like I haven't
[00:35:35] like played or anything so all I know is
[00:35:37] the wording and like the only thing that
[00:35:39] people would tell you before this is
[00:35:41] like official is the same [ __ ] that now
[00:35:43] is official for the most part some of
[00:35:44] it's still not official so I assume it
[00:35:48] works like Shen but if it doesn't it
[00:35:50] doesn't not played her no I wouldn't lie
[00:35:52] about that if I played her I wouldn't
[00:35:54] lie I haven't played her
[00:35:58] so like on God I wouldn't lie about that
[00:36:00] I haven't
[00:36:04] so assuming she works like
[00:36:08] chanha the only thing that makes me
[00:36:13] mad is
[00:36:16] that Shena
[00:36:18] quills would benefit from are
[00:36:22] multiplied um I assume that I I'm pretty
[00:36:24] sure this how the formula works but it
[00:36:26] effectively they will benefit from
[00:36:29] damage
[00:36:30] Buffs crit
[00:36:32] Buffs and attack percent is a little bit
[00:36:34] less valuable which means
[00:36:41] Vermillion okay listen listen it just
[00:36:44] means attack stats can be shut up don't
[00:36:47] [ __ ] talk to me right now don't
[00:36:48] [ __ ] talk to me right now don't
[00:36:50] [ __ ] talk to me there's a chance that
[00:36:52] Vermillion in the soul Shin sh Shin sh
[00:36:56] Shan Yun teams might be slightly worse
[00:36:59] but but don't listen here [ __ ]
[00:37:01] listen here [ __ ] you listen
[00:37:04] that's okay however because of how much
[00:37:07] crit rate Mari Shi gives you and Jade
[00:37:11] spear being his best weapon and him
[00:37:13] having crit rate Ascension it Vermillion
[00:37:16] could still be better unless you get
[00:37:17] like perfect dodging crit rate every
[00:37:19] time on MAR CH but also it gives you one
[00:37:22] less stat at Max investment to where
[00:37:24] Vermillion might still be better we
[00:37:25] don't know the math isn't out but wait
[00:37:27] wait wait wait wait wait let me be
[00:37:29] honest right now a lot of people listen
[00:37:31] it like it could be easier to go said
[00:37:33] that just gives you credit raate but
[00:37:34] it's at like super mid Max Omega
[00:37:36] investment level I would still argue for
[00:37:38] Vermillion unless you're going home up
[00:37:39] now the reason why is because uh
[00:37:42] allegedly if you get like two to three
[00:37:44] crit rate rolls you're probably going to
[00:37:46] be overcapped on crit rate and because
[00:37:48] of this it effectively makes it to where
[00:37:50] not only do not want to roll crit rate
[00:37:51] ever or Vermillion will be better but
[00:37:53] also also also it makes one of uh it
[00:37:58] gives you one more useless substat so
[00:38:00] for example let's say you're minmax
[00:38:02] child like me right every piece you have
[00:38:04] is going to have crit rate crit damage
[00:38:05] attack and then maybe ER if you want ER
[00:38:07] I don't need ER but if you need it sure
[00:38:09] okay realistically optimized TR with C6
[00:38:12] fars on and and this character and
[00:38:13] finina probably won't need ER maybe a
[00:38:15] little bit if you're not C1 but anyways
[00:38:17] um sure okay so think about that let's
[00:38:20] say you're on a crit rate weapon crit
[00:38:21] rate Ascension M what stats you need
[00:38:23] well you don't need crit rate or it's
[00:38:24] wasted you don't need ER or it's proba
[00:38:26] wasted so what do you want crit damage
[00:38:28] and attack which means you can only have
[00:38:30] two useful substats so two others are
[00:38:32] useless whereas with another set the
[00:38:34] crit rates that would be useful so min
[00:38:37] max turbo investment level there's a
[00:38:38] chance for million is still better uh
[00:38:41] but if you perfectly roll into
[00:38:43] everything and Dodge everything and only
[00:38:44] get crit damage then there's a chance
[00:38:46] Mai might be better now does this matter
[00:38:48] for normal people no either strong boss
[00:38:50] from million or far which is a more
[00:38:51] efficient domain but for someone who
[00:38:53] spent over 100k resin in a domain I
[00:38:56] would rather pee into a mug then pour it
[00:39:00] onto okay this okay boil it then make it
[00:39:03] burning hot then pour it onto my
[00:39:06] keyboard burn the keys and have to play
[00:39:08] with whatever's left for the rest of my
[00:39:10] life never being able to change it then
[00:39:12] have to change artifact sets on Shia
[00:39:14] after farming for so long so ideally
[00:39:17] it's still best in slot I will see when
[00:39:19] it's out when she's out I'm sure ZF will
[00:39:23] do the math I'm sure Shain will do the
[00:39:24] math I'm sure I will [ __ ] stare at my
[00:39:27] monitor in disbelief we'll see how it is
[00:39:30] and I'll have a more educated opinion
[00:39:32] when that happens however it I still
[00:39:35] would like to believe that for Jade
[00:39:37] Spear and Deathmatch Vermilion is
[00:39:39] probably still going to be the best
[00:39:41] unless maybe super turbo optimized stuff
[00:39:44] Z Jeff already did yeah
[00:39:47] but first of all not out second of all I
[00:39:51] love zff but when he did a video when
[00:39:53] marish chose came out everyone's like oh
[00:39:54] vermillion's dead Mar is better and then
[00:39:56] oh what happened well Vermillion is
[00:39:57] still better A lot of times and then zff
[00:39:59] said that and so stop listening to [ __ ]
[00:40:01] that comes out two weeks before the
[00:40:03] patch comes out cuz it's subject to
[00:40:04] change so don't talk to me but anyways
[00:40:07] we'll see uh
[00:40:10] also um if you're not running a crit
[00:40:12] rate weapon then obviously this might
[00:40:15] change and well obviously everything
[00:40:16] changes so there's a chance we play
[00:40:19] Homa which is a thing I think full
[00:40:22] biased
[00:40:25] moment uh full biased take by the way I
[00:40:28] think most child players either like a
[00:40:31] like a large portion have a crit rate
[00:40:33] weapon with either Jade or Deathmatch
[00:40:34] but if you have a hom that's not being
[00:40:36] used it is also great on sh so you know
[00:40:40] I just think there's not that many
[00:40:41] people that are not not that many people
[00:40:42] but like percentage wise a lot less that
[00:40:45] are running hom shout but if you are
[00:40:48] it'll it is a good weap right now it's a
[00:40:49] good weapon it'll probably be better uh
[00:40:51] even later so that's all right now if
[00:40:55] you're wondering it's about as good as
[00:40:56] Jade it's slightly worse it's better if
[00:40:57] you're under 5050 but that almost never
[00:40:59] happens cuz you're running Bennett and
[00:41:00] finina so like well finina drains your
[00:41:02] HP but you're like healing it back up
[00:41:03] with either Bennett or Jean but anyways
[00:41:07] we'll see we'll see I'm not going to
[00:41:10] give like takes right now well I did
[00:41:11] give takes but I'm not going to like go
[00:41:13] into more details because I could be
[00:41:15] wrong uh however
[00:41:18] look also let me make this very clear I
[00:41:21] am defending Vermillion on my own sh but

[00:58:47] has to
[00:58:48] be it has to start with a or o so what
[00:58:54] if it starts with a
[00:58:57] Al something
[00:58:59] off
[00:59:01] a
[00:59:04] all I'm going to guess for more letters
[00:59:06] I don't really care we're going to
[00:59:09] do we're going to do
[00:59:16] s this is actually a
[00:59:18] good we're going to do this for letters
[00:59:21] ah that did nothing
[00:59:25] what the [ __ ] is this word man what the
[00:59:28] [ __ ] is this word it starts with a or it
[00:59:30] ends with a dude who if you use this
[00:59:33] word you deserve cyber bullying I'm
[00:59:35] sorry I'm sorry no I I didn't mean it
[00:59:37] but I'm sorry I'm sorry what is this
[00:59:41] word a
[00:59:44] flowa no l can't be there L can't be
[00:59:49] there so o has to be there a has to be
[00:59:52] at one of the extremities and then L has
[00:59:55] to be either second or first or or
[00:59:59] last okay let's assume we we end with a
[01:00:02] so let's assume it's like L something F
[01:00:06] has to be there O A
[01:00:09] looa this can't be a word La laoa it
[01:00:13] can't be so it can't be this which means
[01:00:14] L has to be second oh a l has to either
[01:00:19] be second or last so let's assume it's a
[01:00:21] l something o f or Alpha
[01:00:25] alak are any of these words none of
[01:00:28] these are words alas what the [ __ ] is
[01:00:30] that none of these are words so we could
[01:00:33] assume we could
[01:00:36] assume that L might be at the end so it
[01:00:38] could be like something fall or like
[01:00:41] something o a a fool a fall a a CO F
[01:00:49] Joel a no it can't be so what if it's a
[01:00:52] l f o
[01:00:55] no no no what if it ends with L so what
[01:00:56] if it's something f o like that like a a
[01:01:02] a
[01:01:03] a okay it can't be so what if we assume
[01:01:06] that it's a l no a l f o I already did
[01:01:11] this okay [ __ ] a at the start what if we
[01:01:13] assume it starts with L then it goes
[01:01:15] something then it
[01:01:17] goes f o a wait I already did this wait
[01:01:20] what was the other option L could also
[01:01:22] be second letter or wait
[01:01:25] that's wait what if it ends with
[01:01:32] a there's no word that's LF what
[01:01:36] aloa vfoa oloa dude what the [ __ ] okay a
[01:01:42] is at the start I've decided a something
[01:01:45] something o something okay what if it's
[01:01:48] off dude what is this word I'm not even
[01:01:51] joking what the [ __ ] is this word dude

[01:27:11] like leveling fourar weapons I can do
[01:27:13] fourar clears and stuff but then if I
[01:27:14] get like an R5 battle pass weapon it's
[01:27:16] like less relatable like I use a fourar
[01:27:18] weapon so it's like oh you can use it
[01:27:19] too but like battle pass is like money
[01:27:21] so I feel like I never used the only one
[01:27:23] I use all the time is serent spine
[01:27:24] serent spine is like turbo broken but
[01:27:26] the other ones I feel like I use
[01:27:27] Deathmatch on like Rosaria I think
[01:27:29] that's
[01:27:30] it but I guess wolfang is really
[01:27:33] good talking stiff for Golden troop
[01:27:36] Cloud retainer
[01:27:50] what you can be my Talking Stick
[01:27:55] what maybe I just go wol
[01:28:00] Fang cuz realistically it's a weapon I
[01:28:02] mean I also don't I don't have Scion and
[01:28:04] I don't have Jade I I have a Talking
[01:28:07] Stick already and I have a ballot of the
[01:28:11] fjori the bow are ass yeah I mean h like
[01:28:16] it's okay stat stick Verdes and Hunt
[01:28:18] used to be really good it's still fine
[01:28:19] like the effect is great if you can use
[01:28:21] it but it's very hard to use in
[01:28:23] practice like I remember like doing
[01:28:25] domains in 1.0 with child you would
[01:28:27] group them up with ressent hunt and then
[01:28:28] like rip tied everywhere it was
[01:28:31] great but yeah it's like
[01:28:41] yeah are only character to use the Fang
[01:28:43] though no what no this is good for skill
[01:28:47] and burst damage a lot of Swords can use
[01:28:48] this honestly most swords can use this
[01:28:55] well not like most there's a lot of
[01:28:57] supports but
[01:28:59] no finina kaching s yeah literally
[01:29:03] almost anyone well DPS wise I think we
[01:29:05] just take um I think we should just be
[01:29:08] smart and take the Talking
[01:29:16] Stick I do need more bows if I'm being
[01:29:19] honest this could be good for like big a
[01:29:22] te it could be good for like what if I
[01:29:23] use this on g
[01:29:26] chat I
[01:29:30] mean
[01:29:41] no I mean if we play G it's going to be
[01:29:44] support
[01:29:50] so
[01:29:59] okay uh let's do guide to

[01:38:56] unless you just aren't running the
[01:38:57] elements it's pretty easy to know how to
[01:38:59] build any anemo character in the
[01:39:03] [Music]
[01:39:20] game
[01:39:26] you're going to use her to buff sh
[01:39:29] Scrat maybe but even if that is the case
[01:39:34] right finina does a lot of damage but
[01:39:38] you you probably you might be able to

[01:40:20] and vener unless you're playing Shia
[01:40:22] maybe Scara but usually okay just here

[01:48:08] months oh yeah also to clear okay to to
[01:48:11] address some rumors months to address
[01:48:14] some rumors clear up any concerns talk
[01:48:17] about the
[01:48:18] controversy I've had people DM me about
[01:48:20] my Ula build be like yo man just
[01:48:24] wondering is this Ula like a meme or is
[01:48:25] it good with like Mari Jose and like uh
[01:48:28] is this like a build
[01:48:30] listen 8.9 crit rate almost 400 crit
[01:48:34] damage YULA I didn't use food by the way
[01:48:36] if I used food I would had 400 and
[01:48:39] six uh YULA with 112 ER is a meme okay
[01:48:43] for this build to be optimal we would
[01:48:44] need more energy recharge and ideally a
[01:48:48] bit less crit rate uh you want as close
[01:48:50] to 5% as possible to make use of ula's
[01:48:52] passive where uh well first of all you
[01:48:54] want to have as much crit damage as
[01:48:56] possible second of all her passive gives
[01:48:57] her more damage the less crit rate she
[01:48:59] has it's just inherent uh ask any Ula
[01:49:01] player it's pretty good though pretty
[01:49:03] good
[01:49:04] build dude but think about it Ma if
[01:49:07] we're on MAR Shela that's plus 36 if
[01:49:10] we're on uh cryo residence that's plus
[01:49:12] like why do I not remember 15 and then
[01:49:14] if we're on Rosaria plus another
[01:49:19] 15

[01:54:52] meantime I just want to play the game
[01:54:53] because I want
[01:54:54] to uh because we're catching
[01:55:08] up building
[01:55:11] QQ
[01:55:15] today actually no I'm probably not going
[01:55:17] to have time
[01:55:18] to
[01:55:27] okay why would he build QQ sus it's

[01:55:41] guys to know this about me
[01:55:43] I have a I
[01:55:47] despise I despise is forcing mono
[01:55:50] Quantum everywhere I hate it I think
[01:55:52] it's so cringe okay unlucky speed boots
[01:55:55] could be good nope could be
[01:56:03] good got a [ __ ]
[01:56:08] achievement my cely already bench mine
[01:56:11] is
[01:56:13] uh going talk about
[01:56:17] it dude it's just dude it's like people
[01:56:20] okay I'm going to say it I'm going to
[01:56:21] say
[01:56:22] it let me go to the [ __ ] memory of
[01:56:24] chaos before I say it uh I'm going to do
[01:56:27] this thing it's faster I don't know if
[01:56:28] it's actually faster or Not O well I'm
[01:56:30] going to get distracted boom okay it
[01:56:33] reset right since I last did it memory
[01:56:35] chaos M chaos uh where the [ __ ] is it oh
[01:56:38] there it
[01:56:39] is yeah
[01:56:43] reset I'm going to say it dude it's it's
[01:56:46] not if you want to play Quantum and
[01:56:48] [ __ ] Force an implant it's not hard
[01:56:50] to just adjust your last support you
[01:56:52] don't need [ __ ]
[01:56:54] four if you don't have car like what are
[01:56:57] the odds you don't have okay you might
[01:56:58] not have a bunch of characters built but
[01:57:00] what are the odds you have four quantums
[01:57:01] built that are probably all five stars
[01:57:03] maybe not QQ like three five
[01:57:07] stars I don't
[01:57:09] know like three or okay two to four five
[01:57:12] stars build but not like an extra healer
[01:57:15] or an extra support that you can Flex is
[01:57:16] what it
[01:57:18] is
[01:57:20] like yeah ex like if the enemies win
[01:57:22] weak you could literally like look look
[01:57:23] look look look like if you're trying to
[01:57:25] if you're trying to force implant
[01:57:26] against like here you can literally do
[01:57:28] [ __ ] whatever quantum dps Quantum
[01:57:30] support let's say future Quantum Harmony
[01:57:32] and then or no you'll be running silver
[01:57:34] wolf here but you could do four quantum
[01:57:35] but like if you don't want to run a
[01:57:36] [ __ ] last slot has to be Quantum you
[01:57:38] could literally just do oh braia okay
[01:57:40] you're fine oh it's [ __ ] electric
[01:57:42] weakness oh well I could play Ting Yun
[01:57:44] instead oh I could play [ __ ] any of
[01:57:45] the supports we got instead wow
[01:57:48] pog but you
[01:57:52] know same with like healers but healers
[01:57:54] are a bit more Niche cuz you're not
[01:57:55] going to have that many built however
[01:57:57] lyx is a Quantum character uh Lynx is a
[01:57:59] Quantum healer
[01:58:01] so or is
[01:58:03] that
[01:58:06] anyways
[01:58:08] don't don't ever say it's over if I'm
[01:58:15] breathing tanglement is POG I want
[01:58:17] tangle you yeah but you don't need four
[01:58:20] [ __ ] Quant like I don't like Quantum
[01:58:22] teams are like they're not bad I just
[01:58:24] and mono Quantum is not bad I just I
[01:58:26] don't personally I don't see the benefit
[01:58:28] of your last slot having to be like
[01:58:30] Quantum versus just flexing what you
[01:58:32] need and then forcing the implant with
[01:58:34] silver wolf like silver wolf can force
[01:58:35] an implant if your last character in
[01:58:37] your team is just whatever the enem is
[01:58:39] weak
[01:58:42] to like if you're running cely silver
[01:58:44] wolf and then the enemy's lightning weak
[01:58:46] and you go Ting Yun okay B kind of sucks
[01:58:49] but for the example I'll say Bou you can
[01:58:50] always Force Quantum or like luo I don't
[01:58:53] know well you don't want to like Lua
[01:58:55] welt but you could like luo BR but then
[01:58:56] or like wo BR have to wind but anyways
[01:59:01] anyways um I think we're ready we could
[01:59:04] just the only problem with my like
[01:59:06] builds right now is my f Run's really
[01:59:08] low speed uh CU my boots are on other
[01:59:10] characters I don't think it really
[01:59:18] matters
[01:59:20] but should be fine M and Mar from top to
[01:59:23] bottom the third to
[01:59:30] last I could level this defense subsat
[01:59:33] is not bad on speed boots but there's no
[01:59:34] HP there ideally would have uh like
[01:59:37] speed with defense HP effect
[01:59:40] res
[01:59:45] [Music]
[01:59:46] yeah this is not bad speed defense no
[01:59:50] flat defense
[01:59:51] unlucky
[01:59:55] yeah wait maybe I level this set
[01:59:57] actually and then I could just go wait a
[02:00:00] second let me
[02:00:02] cook and I could just
[02:00:05] go H that's fine I think she's
[02:00:09] fine wait
[02:00:13] actually wait no I'm getting
[02:00:17] distracted I'm getting anyways my point
[02:00:19] was off stream I leveled QQ and I
[02:00:21] leveled links I didn't level links but I
[02:00:23] pre- farmed links or not pre- farmed but
[02:00:26] farmed um but QQ I fully leveled
[02:00:29] basically I just haven't leveled any of
[02:00:31] her traces yet I was waiting and I
[02:00:34] haven't activated a single idle on and I
[02:00:36] haven't put a single I haven't put a
[02:00:39] single Relic on
[02:00:40] her but we got her level 70 out of 80
[02:00:43] and that is
[02:00:48] cool
[02:00:55] what lone are you going to use any of
[02:00:56] the ones we have leveled already I mean
[02:00:58] I could level a new one actually I might
[02:01:00] level a new one I might level peaceful
[02:01:01] but I know like we already have two that
[02:01:04] are leveled that are fine I could level
[02:01:06] a new one I could also use the freeto
[02:01:07] playay one just cuz freeto playay one um
[02:01:11] heo one's unironically not bad by the
[02:01:12] way chat especially for uh what is it
[02:01:14] called Pure Fiction it's actually not
[02:01:17] bad like it sucks for like a five star
[02:01:20] that you pull but
[02:01:21] like it's bad for the pure
[02:01:25] fiction but yeah I know this is a really
[02:01:27] good free to play one and then the
[02:01:28] battle pass one's also pretty good so
[02:01:31] we'll level one of them I
[02:01:34] think wait one sec
[02:01:41] [Applause]
[02:01:48] um
[02:02:04] I was sending a DM okay okay I'm focused
[02:02:06] now uh I'm going to level all my traces
[02:02:08] [ __ ] it should I do I have enough I
[02:02:11] don't have enough I mean I actually
[02:02:14] might no I only have [ __ ] six purple
[02:02:17] okay I actually don't h
[02:02:19] I'll wait
[02:02:23] you okay we'll do world
[02:02:28] seven what this guy weak
[02:02:34] to um we'll just do [ __ ] I would say
[02:02:38] jiguan but I don't feel like playing him
[02:02:39] we'll just brute force it we'll just BR
[02:02:42] force it uh we'll do
[02:02:47] this
[02:02:53] sely forever benched she's not forever
[02:02:56] benched it's just temporary dude I don't
[02:02:58] feel like gearing every
[02:03:02] stream okay
[02:03:04] fine okay watch this watch this watch
[02:03:07] actually I literally can't unbench her
[02:03:09] by the way I don't want to use this on
[02:03:10] her but I literally can't even unbench
[02:03:12] her because my whole Quantum sets on
[02:03:14] jinglu so I literally can't even if I
[02:03:15] wanted
[02:03:17] to even if I wanted to how is that my
[02:03:20] fault what are these guys weak to oh
[02:03:22] fire as well I could play topaz second
[02:03:24] half do you want to play topaz I could
[02:03:26] play topaz we could do topaz
[02:03:31] ratio
[02:03:33] um a Healer let's say Ron
[02:03:40] hoo then here we could play
[02:03:45] Loa stage seven yeah just reforce it
[02:03:49] but
[02:03:50] still I taste malice in the a show your
[02:03:54] the
[02:03:56] moon Auto time no no watch watch watch
[02:03:59] this is me manually playing I'm just
[02:04:01] really
[02:04:06] fast L me your strength your end L tag L
[02:04:11] tag would have been a waste of time cuz
[02:04:12] if you press your skill it summons the
[02:04:13] field which is an animation that you
[02:04:15] don't need in memory Cal 7 so it would
[02:04:16] have objectively been a waste of time
[02:04:18] true
[02:04:19] I just saved
[02:04:23] time fail to send
[02:04:27] you in lunar
[02:04:38] flame to guard and defend CR them quench
[02:04:44] them savor it for
[02:04:47] me
[02:04:51] is everyone E6 yeah I just E6 every
[02:04:54] character I actually just maxed my
[02:04:56] credit card so every time there's a new
[02:04:57] character it auto
[02:04:59] payments I have it set up so every time
[02:05:01] there's a new character it auto e6's
[02:05:03] them I don't even see the pulls it just
[02:05:04] Auto pulls for
[02:05:11] me I miss my HSR comms dude literally
[02:05:14] all you need to do for Commissions in
[02:05:15] this game now they literally do they
[02:05:17] [ __ ] for some dud they literally
[02:05:19] quality of life did to where all you
[02:05:21] need to do is Auto Battle your [ __ ]
[02:05:23] stamina and that's it you fully [ __ ]
[02:05:25] do it you do whatever domain you feel
[02:05:27] like doing whatever callx you feel like
[02:05:28] doing it's done in like 5 minutes
[02:05:32] flame fail to set you why is your DPS
[02:05:35] low are you we are Auto battling against
[02:05:38] an ice resistant
[02:05:39] enemy
[02:05:41] sorry
[02:05:46] sorry saber it for me
[02:05:53] yeah I might go do golden gears though
[02:05:55] cuz at least I can play I don't like 78
[02:05:57] n and 10 are or 10 is not boring but
[02:05:59] eight S eight and nine are boring to me
[02:06:02] 10 is okay 11's okay and then 12 is
[02:06:05] hype I mean I guess 11's hard too kind
[02:06:08] of I don't really
[02:06:10] remember I just did it and then didn't
[02:06:12] think about it to
[02:06:17] you
[02:06:33] how much crit damage you have on braon
[02:06:34] don't talk to
[02:06:36] me so arraia
[02:06:39] okay do you want the honest answer
[02:06:41] arraia okay ARR okay ARR is Turbo
[02:06:45] optimized to have the perfect amount of
[02:06:48] speed for our blade so she's on 174
[02:06:53] speed she's on 174 speed which is really
[02:06:56] good but we're very low crit damage
[02:06:59] because I'm not that mid Max so it's the
[02:07:01] only thing I have I just have
[02:07:03] speed all will be swept away by the
[02:07:06] wind eventually we'll get crit damage
[02:07:09] and speed but for now we have 174 speed
[02:07:12] why so that we can be skill point
[02:07:14] neutral with our blade we can normal
[02:07:16] attack then blade goes and then skill
[02:07:19] and then blade goes again it is actually
[02:07:21] optimal for our blade team uh I believe
[02:07:24] it's like you
[02:07:25] want what is the exact number it's like
[02:07:28] 100 speed and then you want 170 on BR or
[02:07:30] some [ __ ] but we're low Talent level so
[02:07:33] it works out with 101 and
[02:07:36] 174 but
[02:07:41] yeah 171 it might be 171 but usually
[02:07:45] there's a range like it's like within a
[02:07:46] few and only C are a bunch of Cycles I
[02:07:49] don't
[02:07:50] know me
[02:07:53] anyways it might be
[02:07:58] 171 Zer Point
[02:08:08] go g your verius just Auto attacked I
[02:08:12] mean this is Auto Battle it's not this
[02:08:14] is not don't take this
[02:08:17] seriously
[02:08:21] me look at these fall attacks
[02:08:25] sheing you didn't
[02:08:31] die
[02:08:33] wow who calls him verius I don't
[02:08:36] know I actually don't know oh
[02:08:43] easy why can't I leave
[02:08:47] okay
[02:08:49] but
[02:08:52] yeah yeah we have like no crit damage
[02:08:55] but we have speed we're just testing out
[02:08:57] stuff okay we'll get crit damage later
[02:08:58] but it doesn't matter that much for now
[02:08:59] we're just a
[02:09:00] speeder doesn't
[02:09:02] matter we probably lose like what like
[02:09:05] [ __ ] 20% 16% crit damage it's fine
[02:09:08] free skill
[02:09:12] points but for this we can actually
[02:09:15] change our our build because we're
[02:09:17] probably going to play Bron here are we
[02:09:19] br's a bit not as needed in Golden gears
[02:09:22] compared to just like Ron May who's
[02:09:24] always you don't need to
[02:09:27] think I mean BR is bronia though she's
[02:09:29] always
[02:09:33] broken but yeah dude look at these look
[02:09:35] at this [ __ ] sub we have nine and 11
[02:09:38] we have an 11 speed ER rope I don't even
[02:09:41] know how this is legal by the way I
[02:09:43] actually don't know how this is legal
[02:09:44] but uh we'll go for the crit damage
[02:09:46] build for now we'll swap with who has
[02:09:48] our crit
[02:09:49] damage oh silver for some
[02:09:53] reason time for a
[02:09:56] bug uh where's
[02:09:59] the crit damage one oh it's
[02:10:09] there actually are we even playing
[02:10:11] bronia right now who am I playing Chad
[02:10:14] who are we playing wait let me decide
[02:10:16] who we're playing first before I scuff
[02:10:17] everything before I [ __ ] everything up
[02:10:19] let's decide who we're
[02:10:20] playing we have like we have to speed
[02:10:22] onun this um why am on an HP rope I have
[02:10:26] ER are here I mean I guess it doesn't
[02:10:28] matter that much for her but you still
[02:10:30] want to burst for the buff up time or
[02:10:32] the talent up
[02:10:34] time I like
[02:10:43] healing dude I do not have enough ropes
[02:10:47] Jesus
[02:10:53] we could Argent again we could also do a
[02:10:55] follow-up attack path like just Eli spam
[02:10:57] I don't know if that's good though I
[02:10:59] kind of want to try new [ __ ] as well cuz
[02:11:01] I feel like I always do the same two
[02:11:02] things I know remembrance is really good
[02:11:05] remembrance sounds cringe but I am down
[02:11:07] to do
[02:11:14] it loging every day
[02:11:17] yeah okay I'm just going to I'm going to
[02:11:20] steal pila's rope sorry
[02:11:24] peila and then we're probably not going
[02:11:26] to play PE right
[02:11:28] now sorry pea nothing against
[02:11:34] you do you have enough effect res
[02:11:37] there's no way I don't if you make me
[02:11:38] check and I don't I will [ __ ] scream
[02:11:40] there's no way I
[02:11:42] don't yeah 48 I don't have enough speed
[02:11:45] but it doesn't matter for for this we'll
[02:11:47] get speed Buffs
[02:11:49] um golden
[02:11:51] gears yeah we're so dude we're L at the
[02:11:53] beginning we'll finish it
[02:11:54] though dude I first tried 51 but we have
[02:11:57] to do five there's like 12 right why you
[02:12:00] say pil cuz I think it's
[02:12:01] funnier I'm not I'm not conforming to

[02:13:27] if we do dude I feel like is hunt still
[02:13:29] griefing feel like every time I picked
[02:13:31] hunt and every time I picked hunt and
[02:13:32] swarm I felt like why wasn't I playing
[02:13:34] destruction or
[02:13:37] like remembrance or some
[02:13:41] [ __ ] yes
[02:13:44] okay
[02:13:46] sad
[02:13:49] I mean we could try I want to try
[02:13:51] propagation I would use QQ but she's not
[02:13:53] geared so don't talk to me we can play
[02:13:55] in B Lun Luni why do I have 39 crit rate
[02:13:59] chat chat why do I have 39 crit rate oh
[02:14:02] I give all my bill to [ __ ] Dr top Dr
[02:14:04] ratio that's
[02:14:11] why I
[02:14:14] know
[02:14:16] why
[02:14:23] wait I have exactly 135 speed I have no
[02:14:27] crit damage though where did my crit
[02:14:28] damage go oops all crit
[02:14:32] rate oh we're on the wrong um
[02:14:36] gloves 7240 not even bad honestly
[02:14:40] honestly for no crit
[02:14:46] weapon
[02:14:50] no Rin
[02:15:07] no iner who should we play next uh I'm
[02:15:11] not to play RM cuz RM I'm not to play
[02:15:13] Fen what if we do double healer [ __ ] it
[02:15:17] do you think we clear I think we do the
[02:15:19] but maybe we download lra halfway
[02:15:20] through maybe we download lra halfway
[02:15:25] through or we just start with
[02:15:27] it RM
[02:15:33] Opa haa for skill points not a bad idea
[02:15:36] but I think RM is too
[02:15:42] broken is this S5 yet can I please S5 it
[02:15:45] I
[02:15:46] can't
[02:15:51] can't wait to be one energy off my
[02:15:53] ALT play solo sustained you want me to
[02:15:56] [ __ ] die okay we'll try it no we'll
[02:15:59] try it since I have a [ __ ] smart guy
[02:16:00] in the chat we'll try it we'll try
[02:16:04] it uh I assume my tingyun is geared I'm
[02:16:06] just going to play tting Yun cuz she
[02:16:07] probably almost one year
[02:16:12] already I mean I guess this is probably
[02:16:14] optimal okay fine
[02:16:18] oh she's going to
[02:16:21] die how much HP does she have that's
[02:16:24] actually not that
[02:16:30] bad 07 dude it's not that
[02:16:33] bad we'll just we'll vent her for L
[02:16:36] halfway
[02:16:39] through there she is
[02:16:42] okay you can ban paths yes I remembered
[02:16:45] this so we're going to ban
[02:16:48] and so here's my logic [ __ ] hunt hunt
[02:16:51] has some good support ones hunt has like
[02:16:52] the energy when you kill stuff whatever
[02:16:55] but uh wait isn't irir addition kind of
[02:16:58] bad here irir addition hunt bands cuz
[02:17:01] preservation has good support ones
[02:17:02] Elation gives
[02:17:04] you uh some are useless some are good
[02:17:06] though I mean hunt has good support
[02:17:08] maybe [ __ ] Elation preservation has good
[02:17:10] support desert
[02:17:11] destruction wait what does destruction
[02:17:13] give no destruction wait [ __ ]
[02:17:16] destruction wait wait wait let me use
[02:17:18] logic nil is really good cuz it gives
[02:17:19] you weakness break efficiency El can
[02:17:21] make your followup attacks like your Al
[02:17:23] to followup attacks and some other [ __ ]
[02:17:24] that's not bad audition I don't know if
[02:17:25] they have good support ones destruction
[02:17:28] I don't know if they have good support I
[02:17:29] don't think they have good support ones
[02:17:30] preservation kind of I mean destruction
[02:17:32] gives you effect res when you're low and
[02:17:33] defense when you're low but like I don't
[02:17:35] really care I guess it helps Fen cuz she
[02:17:37] can get
[02:17:38] low and then hunt gives you energy when
[02:17:40] you kill stuff or speed so I guess we
[02:17:42] could keep
[02:17:43] it I don't know about preservation or IR
[02:17:46] addition though or elation preservation
[02:17:48] is not bad I
[02:17:50] mean Buck
[02:17:53] alation what does erudition give brain
[02:17:56] and a vat yeah but don't you need the oh
[02:17:59] I guess you just take the [ __ ]
[02:18:00] blessing for that okay yeah I'm
[02:18:02] convinced [ __ ]
[02:18:04] ation yeah we don't have we don't have
[02:18:06] any
[02:18:07] follow
[02:18:13] okay oh Gage oh Gage

[02:18:55] never mind wait I mean they're not all
[02:18:57] the same but they all give basic attack

[03:38:52] pulls new memory of CHA I think new
[03:38:54] memory of chaos likees is probably the
[03:38:56] thing I'm I was hyped for wait what else
[03:38:58] was there there's something else that
[03:38:59] was hyped for there's a
[03:39:02] fourar only four fourar to choose from
[03:39:04] though right but still they're pretty
[03:39:09] cracked
[03:39:11] yeah The KES are sick I'm very hyped for
[03:39:13] that oh and Relic sets yeah Relic sets
[03:39:15] too Relic sets are actually huge wait
[03:39:17] did they say what one of them did cuz I
[03:39:19] know the break Effect one POG Ron May
[03:39:21] whatever what about the other ones 20
[03:39:23] greater than three true although it's 20
[03:39:25] versus 13 but yeah true uh where is it
[03:39:28] where the [ __ ] is
[03:39:35] it uh it was near the end actually yeah
[03:39:38] it was here it here it's here did they
[03:39:39] say what did characters equi this Relic
[03:39:42] set can deal more damage
[03:39:44] too currently okay yeah ratio set yeah
[03:39:47] yeah yeah cuz I heard people in chat
[03:39:49] were typing ratio set but I wasn't sure
[03:39:51] yeah that's why okay yeah yeah that's
[03:39:52] really good so um yeah I hope you didn't
[03:39:55] Farm the imaginary set because if you
[03:39:57] did sorry sorry dude don't Farm dude
[03:40:02] that domain is don't go there but
[03:40:07] yeah I I also farmed it a little by
[03:40:10] twopiece yeah there you go so that's a
[03:40:13] probably a set for him maybe others as
[03:40:14] well and then this is a break effect
[03:40:17] which is kind of Niche but nice for Ron
[03:40:19] May and maybe the [ __ ] the new for
[03:40:22] that came out I haven't played her yet
[03:40:23] though shu is is her name I
[03:40:26] think but I need to figure out how she
[03:40:28] works so don't quote me on
[03:40:30] [Music]
[03:40:33] that garbage for RM but it's okay yeah
[03:40:36] but it's not like you have a set you
[03:40:37] need to run on her RM literally goes
[03:40:39] twopiece twopiece right now or like four
[03:40:41] piece speed but like wow I mean like
[03:40:43] it's fine it's not a bad set but like it
[03:40:45] can [ __ ] up your order sometimes but it
[03:40:46] doesn't matter but it's usually two bece
[03:40:48] twopiece so it's not like she's not
[03:40:49] waiting for uh twopiece better yeah but
[03:40:51] we don't know what this does so if you
[03:40:53] say it's better either you're guessing
[03:40:54] or you're going off leaks and we're not
[03:40:56] we leaking here right now cuz we'll wait
[03:40:58] till see what it does but twopiece might
[03:40:59] still be better but I I assume they
[03:41:01] probably won't make a two-piece like I
[03:41:03] assume that set is going to have
[03:41:05] twopiece break effect so you could
[03:41:06] always go twopiece of this un it might
[03:41:08] not but there's no way there is a break
[03:41:10] effect said that's two be doesn't have a
[03:41:11] break effect but we'll see it might
[03:41:13] not we see um iide that pretty POG hype
[03:41:18] for the memory K
[03:41:23] lones anything
[03:41:28] else break effect for the team oh did
[03:41:31] they say that
[03:41:36] ooh song at the start was a banger the
[03:41:38] whole wait this one
[03:41:44] this is the intro
[03:41:47] [Music]
[03:41:50] music I don't think that's what you're
[03:41:52] talking about but it is a
[03:41:54] banger yeah so this is cool honestly
[03:41:58] most of it's cool
[03:42:01] nice 20

[03:42:23] everyone but if I was like let's say I
[03:42:25] wasn't a streamr I I would probably pull
[03:42:27] Black Swan cuz I like Black Swan and
[03:42:29] she's probably going to work with Kafka
[03:42:30] assuming they're because they're both in
[03:42:31] Hil probably so I would get both um but

[04:07:46] way this
[04:07:50] time I will not I will not add
[04:07:54] [Music]
[04:08:02] fuel I'm hyped though I've been enjoying
[04:08:04] star recently so that's good that means
[04:08:06] I can enjoy both so whichever one wins
[04:08:08] wins I
[04:08:10] wins any soon anniversary dude
[04:08:14] anniversary you choose wait let me think
[04:08:17] it's going to be a choice of something I
[04:08:19] think that's my take I was thinking free
[04:08:22] standard five star but you already get
[04:08:23] that if you pull 300 so I don't think it
[04:08:24] would be
[04:08:25] that maybe it'll just be a [ __ ] ton of
[04:08:28] pulls maybe I was thinking like a free
[04:08:31] something of choice like five star lone
[04:08:33] or character or some [ __ ] but maybe not
[04:08:36] cuz they also let you Cho choose a free
[04:08:38] standard five star like we already have
[04:08:40] that if you pull 300 times which is a
[04:08:42] lot
[04:08:44] but so I don't
[04:08:50] know yeah it could just be a [ __ ]
[04:08:52] free character don't get your standards
[04:08:54] too high no I'm absolutely going to get
[04:08:55] my standards
[04:09:06] High
[04:09:09] because the whole argument is we don't
[04:09:12] want to be treated like [ __ ] so we need
[04:09:14] to get good rewards which
[04:09:16] means if we get good rewards and then
[04:09:18] anniversary they're like [ __ ] you you
[04:09:20] can't be like oh well we're
[04:09:24] happy hopefully though see aloy yeah
[04:09:28] they add aloy to this game too [ __ ]
[04:09:35] it yeah we'll see
[04:09:43] I'm tweeting the
[04:09:50] likeone to be looking can you imagine

[04:14:18] want to for four months I appreciate it
[04:14:22] the only
[04:14:23] thing wait also correct me if I'm wait
[04:14:30] also should we raid Z we can raid
[04:14:34] Z I'm going to ra zes but uh War warning
[04:14:37] I do not
[04:14:38] agree warning I do not condone or stand
[04:14:42] by zff star rail takes they're not
[04:14:44] necessarily bad I just listen listen
[04:14:48] let's not talk about the Arland cely
[04:14:50] Incident That's All I'm gonna say that's
[04:14:51] all I'm gonna say we're going to rate
[04:14:53] them
[04:14:55] um
[04:14:59] yeah okay now that we're raing and the
[04:15:01] stream's over and everyone's gone I have
[04:15:02] a question when everyone was saying only
[04:15:04] three pulls kek W okay look obviously L
[04:15:07] the rewards we get in St are like
[04:15:09] significantly way better and that's
[04:15:10] great and we should get more inion but
[04:15:12] wasn't it 13 pulls why people say three
[04:15:13] is it not 13 am I dumb is it not 13
[04:15:16] versus
[04:15:17] 20 is it not 13 am I
[04:15:21] dumb why is the the Cofe pass the three
[04:15:25] it's 10 and three versus 10 and 10 20 is
[04:15:27] obviously better but like
[04:15:32] 13 cuz three to thank us I see but still
[04:15:37] still but yeah it's 10 to thank us
[04:15:39] versus three to thank us which I think
[04:15:42] looks worse than 20 versus 10 if so or
[04:15:45] 20 versus
[04:15:47] 13 but yeah anyways thanks for watching
