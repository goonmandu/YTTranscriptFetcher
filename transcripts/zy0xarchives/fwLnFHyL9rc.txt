[00:18:47] um who else is a pole arm from leeway
[00:18:51] I don't know how to pronounce that yeah
[00:18:53] what does use yeah it doesn't use slimes
[00:18:55] I don't think yeah these are slimes I'm
[00:18:57] pretty sure who taught us I'm pretty
[00:18:58] wait okay I've crowned two towels I
[00:19:01] should know this but I don't remember
[00:19:02] it's been a while
[00:19:05] pretty sure who that was
[00:19:07] pretty sure without using slimes oh I
[00:19:10] can look at the books too Prosperity
[00:19:11] gold who does diligence so that would
[00:19:13] make sense I don't know about yayao
[00:19:15] though the [ __ ] does yaya use I don't
[00:19:17] think she's the times there's no way
[00:19:18] yeah yeah we do slimes who else is there
[00:19:21] who else can use lithic blade
[00:19:24] chiangling oppa wait the Strangling [ __ ]
[00:19:27] what the shangling
[00:19:29] dude how do I only have none of my
[00:19:33] guesses were bad none of my I just
[00:19:35] rolled off like none of my guesses were
[00:19:36] bad and yet I'm out of my last [ __ ]
[00:19:38] guess I'm pretty sure shangling uses
[00:19:39] slimes I'm like 90 because she cooked
[00:19:42] slime is for breakfast
[00:19:44] [ __ ] I wish I could look at chat okay
[00:19:47] what other elements are there there's
[00:19:48] dendro Hydro pyro is there a hydro polar
[00:19:50] from [ __ ] leeway I don't think so
[00:19:53] Candace isn't from there
[00:19:55] is there another hydropolar
[00:20:00] I mean child can technically use a pull
[00:20:02] arm
[00:20:03] technically
[00:20:04] I actually think it's just shangling
[00:20:05] [ __ ] okay hopefully it's not hutao it
[00:20:07] might be hutao
[00:20:09] okay thank God wait what's this okay

[00:20:24] okay but like
[00:20:26] you can't be like oh not a real hotel
[00:20:27] fan dude I low-key wouldn't have
[00:20:30] remembered that Xiao used slimes if I
[00:20:32] didn't play genital because characters
[00:20:33] you crown or like level their talents
[00:20:35] like seven years ago you're not gonna
[00:20:37] remember
[00:20:38] like if you level a character as soon as
[00:20:40] they're out and they've been out for
[00:20:41] like 20 patches you're not gonna
[00:20:42] remember what the [ __ ] you used
[00:20:51] I guess she is why isn't she crowned
[00:20:56] anyways could have been Yaya as well
[00:20:58] really does yaya actually slimes too
[00:21:03] oh yeah no dude that's actually [ __ ] I
[00:21:05] literally didn't even do a single bad
[00:21:06] guess here and I could have lost because
[00:21:08] we did like good guess into a good guess
[00:21:11] into good guess and then it could have
[00:21:12] been literally like
[00:21:14] a bunch of characters is Yaya also
[00:21:16] diligence though yeah she is dumb
[00:21:19] well
[00:21:20] all right endless mode oh we'll just do
[00:21:22] whatever just to prove that that wasn't
[00:21:23] a fluke and then I'm actually incredibly
[00:21:24] talented and then for the last guess

[00:23:21] I feel like the voice in my head
[00:23:25] wasn't nahitas
[00:23:27] I don't know I just was like because
[00:23:29] nahida would be like
[00:23:31] does she even need to work with me she

[00:28:04] because I already have both it's not
[00:28:05] that I don't like them it's I just have
[00:28:06] both
[00:28:08] um I think it would be more reasonable
[00:28:11] for me to get I already have C1 trials
[00:28:13] and C1 strongly C1 zombies not activated
[00:28:15] though but if I get C2 I might actually
[00:28:17] activate it just because I could use
[00:28:19] this burst and I like using strongly
[00:28:20] burst even though it's like not optimal
[00:28:22] but if you have C2 it's actually like
[00:28:24] worth using so it would give me an
[00:28:26] incentive to actually just use this
[00:28:27] burst which I think is more fun and
[00:28:28] better content
[00:28:30] um so we'll see I probably still won't
[00:28:32] activate it but I might so
[00:28:35] yeah haha but hopefully we don't get
[00:28:38] there hopefully we get from your name
[00:28:40] and if we get a five star we lose 50 50
[00:28:42] so that I get pity for the next Banner
[00:28:45] uh which will be our uh uh a large man
[00:28:51] foreign
[00:29:09] that's not bad child can Loki use the
[00:29:12] charge attack uh damage and can use the
[00:29:14] attack you gain and can use the crit and
[00:29:16] the base attack like yeah polar Stars
[00:29:18] Polar Star but like it's not a good bow
[00:29:21] [ __ ] insane
[00:29:28] anyways we're gonna pull her from a name
[00:29:53] is this a joke I pull on a claymore only
[00:29:55] banner and then I'm I lose the [ __ ] I
[00:29:57] don't get a claymore character but
[00:29:58] instead I get a [ __ ] useless Claymore
[00:30:02] it's not useless Dory can use it okay
[00:30:06] okay we're gonna ignore that temple
[00:30:07] temple number two Temple number two
[00:30:09] Temple number two okay

[00:34:04] all right come out man come on out
[00:34:07] yo come on out
[00:34:09] come on man
[00:34:17] you good man
[00:34:20] yo for me what's up
[00:34:24] hey man how you
[00:34:27] hey how you been Matt
[00:34:33] hey man how are you
[00:34:36] there's a penguin pretty cool
[00:34:46] Hotel buffet
[00:34:50] a reserved young man who is well versed
[00:34:52] in Diving
[00:34:56] okay
[00:35:05] how good are his cons
[00:35:09] that's about as good as they are
[00:35:16] uh okay before okay I'm gonna make a
[00:35:19] team for him and then I'm gonna explain
[00:35:21] I'm not gonna talk about it
[00:35:23] actually I will talk about it okay so
[00:35:25] foreign
[00:35:31] gets damage Buffs if you shatter and
[00:35:33] he's a claymore who's cryo which means
[00:35:35] you want to run Hydro with him
[00:35:36] also he can play
[00:35:38] physical and if you want to play
[00:35:40] physical what element do you want with
[00:35:42] cryo guys to proc super conduct what is
[00:35:45] it children it's Electro so you want
[00:35:48] Hydro for this and you want Electro for
[00:35:50] super conduct so right now let's say you
[00:35:52] have hydro Electro uh and and big
[00:35:56] boyfriend right
[00:35:57] at this point your last character could
[00:36:00] be anyone so you unironically might as
[00:36:02] well you might as well go dendro and
[00:36:06] then you have hyperbloom but like it's
[00:36:07] not a hyperloom team it's a from an ATM
[00:36:09] where you but he needs Hydro he needs
[00:36:12] Electro so you might as well go dendro
[00:36:14] like there's no reason not to there's
[00:36:16] literally no reason what are you gonna
[00:36:17] do swirl physical shut the [ __ ] up even
[00:36:19] if you play him cryo his damage is like
[00:36:20] six so you might as well just go dendro
[00:36:22] so like there's no reason not to uh
[00:36:24] we're gonna play dendro main character
[00:36:25] not nahida maybe uh but I have to go to
[00:36:29] the [ __ ] thing
[00:36:30] so hyperloom's carrying him yes but
[00:36:32] there's no shame in that there's no
[00:36:34] shame in that there's no shame in that
[00:36:37] there's no shame in that
[00:36:41] also his okay I'm gonna be very honest
[00:36:45] here and say that from what I know we're
[00:36:48] gonna we're gonna play we're gonna test
[00:36:49] them together right but from what I know
[00:36:52] and and have experienced
[00:36:56] reminisce kit
[00:36:58] is like very unique and interesting and
[00:37:01] cool and I genuinely like it
[00:37:03] but his numbers
[00:37:05] his scalings are not ideal
[00:37:10] um so
[00:37:12] a lot of his kit where it's like you
[00:37:14] want to play him you want to play him
[00:37:16] dude stop hiding you want to play him
[00:37:18] with hydro and Electro anyways so you
[00:37:21] might as well just Chuck Daniel in there
[00:37:22] if you play like Bennett instead or you
[00:37:24] swirl or you play like [ __ ] I don't
[00:37:27] know Jeong Lee or something it's like
[00:37:28] you could but why like it it'll never be
[00:37:33] I can't imagine it being better than the
[00:37:35] damaged hyperloom gives you
[00:37:38] um and then it's like okay yeah the
[00:37:40] supports are just gonna carry him true
[00:37:41] but he's the driver it is what it is
[00:37:53] friend is just a bad Eula oh no how do
[00:37:56] we tell this guy chat how do we tell
[00:37:58] this guy
[00:38:02] how do we tell him
[00:38:13] the one thing I will say is that the
[00:38:16] meme of hyperloom being eula's best team
[00:38:19] please and stream me this is like oh
[00:38:21] yeah like user and then the hydro level
[00:38:23] will carry and it will low-key be the
[00:38:25] best team but at least with freminate
[00:38:27] not like he's obviously not better but
[00:38:29] please what primitive has going for him
[00:38:31] is like even if you want to play a team
[00:38:32] built around him he synergizes with
[00:38:35] hydro and with Electro anyways so it's
[00:38:37] not even like it's not even just like
[00:38:40] okay he sucks so use them as the last
[00:38:42] slot there it's likely that's also how
[00:38:43] you would play them anyways
[00:38:46] then stream not ending stream
[00:38:49] uh also Skyward pride is really good for
[00:38:51] him any weapon that gives him an
[00:38:53] additional instance of damage additional
[00:38:55] motion value and additional hit is good
[00:38:57] because his own scalings are so bad so
[00:38:59] like Skyward Pride really [ __ ] good
[00:39:01] on him
[00:39:02] um even like archaic or snow tuned are
[00:39:04] fine sermon spines obviously just broken
[00:39:05] because it's servants fine uh so yeah
[00:39:10] foreign
[00:39:13] I'm not going to judge a book by its
[00:39:15] cover let's actually play them
[00:39:17] um so I
[00:39:19] have only tried him cryo
[00:39:24] I haven't well no that's not true I
[00:39:25] tried both but I haven't like played
[00:39:27] much physical so let's play physical
[00:39:30] um
[00:39:31] and I can explain more about it later so
[00:39:34] let's go
[00:39:35] um
[00:39:39] let's see what I have
[00:39:43] holy [ __ ] what is this
[00:39:47] let me change playlist that's annoying
[00:39:50] me
[00:39:59] we're gonna do two pale flame to
[00:40:01] bloodstained obviously four pill flame
[00:40:02] is just objectively better but uh sub
[00:40:05] stats matter a lot
[00:40:07] uh they don't call me the sub stats
[00:40:10] Sally for nothing so we're gonna go
[00:40:13] based on sub stats they do call me that
[00:40:14] by the way that's a real thing that
[00:40:16] people call me uh I didn't make that up
[00:40:17] so we're gonna go here uh we'll go for
[00:40:20] the one with ER because from an A
[00:40:22] actually does need ER
[00:40:25] oh where
[00:40:44] 141 probably enough we'll see
[00:40:48] all right pretty good uh now literally
[00:40:51] today literally this morning I
[00:40:53] pre-farmed flowers bosses and a few
[00:40:58] Talent books to make sure I could get
[00:40:59] him oh I didn't look at my XP but I
[00:41:01] should have enough so make sure I could
[00:41:02] get him level 80. We're not gonna go all
[00:41:03] the way to 90 right now because that
[00:41:05] would take too long but we could at
[00:41:07] least get him
[00:41:08] 280
[00:41:10] is it really bad or still usable he's
[00:41:11] still usable but he's gonna be carried
[00:41:13] by his supports you'll see well we'll
[00:41:14] see we'll see
[00:41:15] we'll see
[00:41:20] that's not enough it is for 80.
[00:41:22] absolutely how much you want to bet how
[00:41:24] much you want to bet how much you want
[00:41:25] to bet how much you want to bet how much
[00:41:26] you want to bet how much you want to bet
[00:41:27] I literally have access to the [ __ ]
[00:41:29] star glitter shop too you're not even
[00:41:31] bet any amount of money right now bet
[00:41:34] any amount of money any amount of money
[00:41:38] look look now we go to the [ __ ] blue
[00:41:40] box look look we have so many dude dude
[00:41:42] dude dude you don't even know it's
[00:41:44] actually enough you guys are actually

[00:41:47] right now you guys are actually copying
[00:41:49] right now okay I need to make these but
[00:41:50] I have enough
[00:41:52] all right let me go make them
[00:41:57] dude
[00:41:59] gem trunk things ready no one you have
[00:42:02] to craft them
[00:42:15] you'll see the enemy mats yeah I
[00:42:17] performed a little bit of it I did fight
[00:42:19] the [ __ ] underwater losers but I
[00:42:22] don't know if we have enough people clap
[00:42:25] people clap
[00:42:32] we definitely don't have enough but you
[00:42:34] know we can worst case go underwater all
[00:42:36] good is what it is I didn't kill the
[00:42:37] seals I killed other ones
[00:42:51] why are you guys having cap I
[00:42:52] unironically would not hurt the seals
[00:43:00] also I'm pretty like you guys are saying
[00:43:02] oh oh not enough XP books oh oh yeah
[00:43:04] look at this now what now you owe me all
[00:43:06] the money you you said you would owe me
[00:43:09] level 80.
[00:43:12] I don't know why we leveled him past 70
[00:43:13] but all good
[00:43:16] uh I don't know okay okay it's fine
[00:43:19] surely we have enough it's fine
[00:43:25] enemy mods but
[00:43:27] uh I mean we can just craft them we can
[00:43:29] just craft them we could just we can
[00:43:31] just craft them we can just grab them we
[00:43:32] could just grab them we can just craft
[00:43:33] them we could just craft them
[00:43:37] Don't Call Him friend boy okay
[00:43:40] we'll craft more we'll craft more we'll
[00:43:42] craft more we'll literally go farm we'll
[00:43:43] literally go farm we're literally we're
[00:43:45] literally about to go farm
[00:43:47] we are four five three
[00:43:53] yeah look at this penguin though this
[00:43:55] penguin counts as attacks look at him
[00:43:57] look at this penguin and then you can
[00:43:58] chalk the penguin
[00:44:02] I'm telling you his kid is actually cool
[00:44:03] unfortunately his numbers are kind of
[00:44:05] ass but his kid is actually cool or you
[00:44:07] could do this if you want to be cryo
[00:44:09] those are like the two ways to play them
[00:44:11] you either do normal and then two more
[00:44:13] normals oh wait what did I just say
[00:44:15] normal and then e and then two normals
[00:44:17] and then e or you just normal and then e
[00:44:18] e but you wanna burst first we just
[00:44:21] don't have it
[00:44:25] all right anyways
[00:44:28] oh I got four ten commissions
[00:44:32] yes yes
[00:44:33] and I'm excited for friend boy how is he
[00:44:38] well let's go to the underwater one so I
[00:44:39] can get some mats
[00:44:45] he's fun to play but [ __ ] well that is
[00:44:47] why we are making our video because if
[00:44:50] you want to play him you can just play
[00:44:52] him in a team that he has Synergy like
[00:44:54] hyperbloom and then you can still clear
[00:44:56] everything because it's hyperboom and
[00:44:57] you get to play them
[00:44:59] what the [ __ ] is this
[00:45:03] I should probably suck this guy let's
[00:45:06] suck him up
[00:45:07] dude what the [ __ ] is
[00:45:10] bro no way I'm about to fail at a
[00:45:11] [ __ ] commission okay wait let me line

[00:45:15] okay that was easy
[00:45:21] dude where did Berry puff go man I'm
[00:45:22] actually sad does anyone know where dude
[00:45:25] he teleported to [ __ ]
[00:45:27] and then I went there and then he
[00:45:29] disappeared where the [ __ ] is he
[00:45:34] why are people asking if a Razer is
[00:45:36] better maybe if you're playing
[00:45:37] thundering furry but if not I
[00:45:58] west of the cage we are west of the cage
[00:46:01] aren't we we're literally west of the
[00:46:02] cage
[00:46:26] confirmina jump out of the water yes I
[00:46:28] think so
[00:46:29] isn't it all Fontan characters

[00:46:46] quack quack
[00:46:49] there's HSR music in the background
[00:46:52] I don't have HSR open
[00:46:57] who the [ __ ] is DOB harku Lord of The
[00:47:00] Hidden
[00:47:03] [ __ ] you jellyfish
[00:47:06] I can't even aim [ __ ] down okay I
[00:47:08] guess I got it
[00:47:16] okay
[00:47:17] can I love more talents so I should have
[00:47:19] killed Mass before starting Street I
[00:47:20] didn't know I needed I
[00:47:22] only I guess we got we got enough white
[00:47:24] ones we got enough followers okay quick
[00:47:25] quick Boss run quick wash one give me
[00:47:26] like five minutes
[00:47:28] stop killing them we're gonna kill every
[00:47:30] single enemy except the seals we don't
[00:47:32] hurt seals in this live stream
[00:47:36] I hate this taco
[00:47:48] wait Chad what is your guys's favorite
[00:47:50] underwater attack
[00:47:51] underwater TC time
[00:47:54] I like the one with two charges or the
[00:47:57] crab the crab's not bad but I think that
[00:47:58] the two charge one which is like the
[00:48:00] manta ray stingray pretty cool
[00:48:03] slash
[00:48:05] wait what the [ __ ] does slash mean
[00:48:07] what animal was that
[00:48:16] slashical Stingray I see
[00:48:21] yeah I like that has two charges because
[00:48:22] you can just like
[00:48:28] who's hot actually
[00:48:30] he's hotter down
[00:48:43] he can choose to be any form therefore
[00:48:46] he can be anything and anyone and
[00:48:48] everyone he could also be a bird
[00:49:00] ciao is Peak until he tried to reach the
[00:49:03] top shelf

[01:05:00] from the shop
[01:05:05] nah I wouldn't use Target on this I
[01:05:07] would not use star grid on this that's
[01:05:08] actually weird that's actually weird if
[01:05:10] you use Target on it you're actually
[01:05:11] weird you're actually weird if you start
[01:05:12] good on it you're actually weird if you
[01:05:14] use star glitter on it
[01:05:17] it is actually weird to you start
[01:05:19] building on that
[01:05:25] dude it's such a common enemy mat too
[01:05:27] that like it's so weird if you start
[01:05:29] good on it you [ __ ] better not that
[01:05:31] would actually be so weird of you if you
[01:05:33] start glitter on it like I can't even
[01:05:34] imagine someone using star glitter on
[01:05:36] that that would just be [ __ ] weird
[01:05:39] I can't even lie I actually can't even
[01:05:41] lie that would be weird that'd be
[01:05:42] [ __ ] weird I can't lie dude that
[01:05:44] would be weird that would actually be
[01:05:46] weird
[01:05:46] good thing I didn't do that
[01:05:54] his top books are today so we could go
[01:05:56] with Tesla while farming it
[01:05:58] might as well do that now
[01:06:02] yep
[01:06:12] [Music]
[01:06:19] if it was my resin 210. yo what is wrong
[01:06:24] with my account my account is actually
[01:06:25] [ __ ] bricked
[01:06:27] I think I plus 16 before starting or
[01:06:29] something I don't even know
[01:06:35] don't even make sense though I don't
[01:06:36] know
[01:06:42] I'm not killing seals
[01:06:46] ah one second I'm just trying something
[01:06:51] okay pretty good uh I don't have a hydro
[01:06:54] character
[01:06:58] Miss Loki a physical team though if we
[01:07:00] don't use Dedra MC as a physical theme
[01:07:02] it's fine
[01:07:03] if we just do this this and then
[01:07:09] let me do one wait no e one two and then
[01:07:13] e again
[01:07:14] sheesh
[01:07:17] did I am pogging so hard right now
[01:07:24] okay we're actually dying
[01:07:27] okay that didn't feel too good
[01:07:30] um but don't worry
[01:07:40] sick
[01:07:54] okay we have the wrong team we have the
[01:07:57] wrong team just give me a second
[01:08:09] boy
[01:08:19] shut up shut the [ __ ] up
[01:08:23] uh oh cause I didn't condense I [ __ ]
[01:08:26] this was probably since last night I
[01:08:28] probably like was like oh let me
[01:08:29] pre-farm and then I'll connect my resin
[01:08:31] and I won't be capped anymore and then I
[01:08:33] [ __ ] forgot to and I wasn't capped
[01:08:34] okay that's probably why it doesn't
[01:08:35] matter we don't talk about my account
[01:08:36] anymore I don't even know what's
[01:08:37] happening let me go connect us
[01:08:41] bro not using Mika why the [ __ ] would I
[01:08:43] use Mika
[01:08:45] Mika Mika of the dice of evonius
[01:08:55] dude I'm relatable Trust
[01:09:08] me attack speed buff is relevant no
[01:09:12] I'm sorry become anything Mika does is
[01:09:15] not more relevant than hyperbloom
[01:09:20] but yes you can you can play Mikko if
[01:09:21] you want
[01:09:23] foreign
[01:09:37] Hydro Electro and then flex and then
[01:09:40] yeah your Flex could be Mika but it
[01:09:42] could also be a dendro unit and then
[01:09:44] look at what happens look at how much
[01:09:45] better this is gonna perform look look
[01:09:47] look look look look I mean here the
[01:09:50] enemies have like a dender shield so it
[01:09:51] might look bad but
[01:09:53] still
[01:09:58] I'm just gonna double e here just to get
[01:10:00] my thing back okay
[01:10:07] that's pretty single Target like he is a
[01:10:09] very single Target character but
[01:10:16] we're off but
[01:10:22] Bros fighting nothing
[01:10:24] um dude shut the [ __ ] up
[01:10:29] foreign
[01:10:38] is physical or cryo better
[01:10:41] um okay if you're not playing hyperbloom
[01:10:43] probably cryo because physical sucks in
[01:10:45] general but in hyperloom physical is
[01:10:46] better because well it depends it
[01:10:48] depends but here physical is usually
[01:10:50] better because you can it's mostly just
[01:10:53] because I think Joe and because hyper
[01:10:54] blue
[01:10:55] um super conduct like I feel like if you
[01:10:57] weren't getting superconduct you could
[01:10:58] go cryo but since you get free
[01:11:00] superconduct you might as well physical
[01:11:02] here and also the cryo build does this
[01:11:05] this is how you play Cry okay you can do
[01:11:06] it normal then you do e e and then you
[01:11:09] can normal so you cannot lose out on
[01:11:10] some Sanctuary swords but if you play
[01:11:12] the physical build you Auto e then Auto
[01:11:15] auto and then e and then Auto so it's
[01:11:17] like you get more synchros
[01:11:20] um here
[01:11:22] [Music]
[01:11:24] imagine being a diver and not having a
[01:11:26] hydro
[01:11:27] okay that was [ __ ]
[01:11:29] why'd you have to do my boy dirty like
[01:11:30] that what did he do to you
[01:11:33] this is why he's [ __ ] this is why
[01:11:34] he's this is why he's sad man
[01:11:48] a really good rotation for Premiere is
[01:11:50] to swap to nahida and never swap back
[01:11:52] okay dude that's why I was using deadron
[01:11:55] MC that's why I was using dandrumsy
[01:11:56] because in a dead drum C team you
[01:11:58] actually want it on Fielder
[01:12:03] [ __ ] we'll play down from C
[01:12:08] what sword is your thing show on
[01:12:12] I mean it's fine we just it's actually
[01:12:15] fine this is our four star build it's
[01:12:17] fine dude it's fine so it's actually
[01:12:19] fine it's not even bad it's fine
[01:12:26] it's okay
[01:12:31] so he needs to make your team worse in
[01:12:33] order to use from an A yeah but you can
[01:12:35] say the same about like half the units
[01:12:36] in gunshin like okay he's okay don't get
[01:12:39] me wrong I'm not gonna defend a bad four
[01:12:40] star a bad force is a bad four star but
[01:12:42] if you want to play them
[01:12:44] these synergizes here you can it's just
[01:12:47] like it's fine like how like clearly
[01:12:49] like
[01:12:50] it's not great though definitely not
[01:12:52] great
[01:12:56] should we do this
[01:12:57] this
[01:13:00] is
[01:13:05] either I [ __ ] the whole rotation up
[01:13:09] it's fine no one noticed because no one
[01:13:10] knows how to play this guy
[01:13:11] [Music]
[01:13:26] we need more ER on our characters we
[01:13:28] didn't get like Synchro didn't even get
[01:13:29] his verse back
[01:13:31] no I mean okay to be fair our Central's
[01:13:34] on [ __ ] 236.9 ER but anyways
[01:13:46] probably should have caught the hydro
[01:13:47] particles on him or something
[01:13:53] strongly with crescent Pike is better in
[01:13:54] this theme dude shut the no
[01:13:57] no one asked you
[01:14:28] wait that was five heads
[01:14:37] how did that not hit the other dude bro
[01:14:39] yeah
[01:14:50] what's up zodge
[01:14:56] [ __ ]
[01:15:03] well they're gonna release a new four so
[01:15:05] that's good I mean that was fine and
[01:15:07] then yeah yeah or like kirani I are
[01:15:08] busted that's sumeru well not busted but
[01:15:11] good I mean yeah yeah it's kind of
[01:15:12] broken I love Yaya I'm a Yugo enjoyer
[01:15:42] [Music]
[01:15:44] I open the [ __ ] menu in the rotation
[01:15:46] [Music]
[01:15:56] he's very quick intensive okay you can
[01:15:59] forgive me
[01:16:00] you can forgive me he's very click
[01:16:03] intensive
[01:16:21] look I'll say everything I'm doing
[01:16:24] oh Auto e for five two
[01:16:28] five cube I had to jump
[01:16:31] up E Auto auto e oh yeah it sounds so
[01:16:35] [ __ ] stupid I'll stop
[01:16:44] my burst expired here I'm actually just
[01:16:45] gonna swap [ __ ] it
[01:16:56] come on
[01:17:03] smells permanent copium
[01:17:06] um okay so something I just want to say
[01:17:09] is um
[01:17:13] actually let's not say it right let's
[01:17:15] let's show it
[01:17:24] let me show something
[01:17:40] that mustard Shield character
[01:17:44] foreign
[01:18:02] I actually think it's fun
[01:18:05] I do actually think it's fun
[01:18:08] oh
[01:18:12] does weapon matter good no really Polar
[01:18:15] Star is good but that's it
[01:18:18] okay I don't think I just don't want it
[01:18:21] to rain it's annoying
[01:18:25] surely it's not raining at midnight
[01:18:27] right surely
[01:18:36] okay let me show you guys something
[01:18:39] so every time we swirl against his boss
[01:18:43] it means we're applying an element right
[01:18:44] like because he's always a Nemo so if we
[01:18:46] like let's say we pyro swirl I mean oh
[01:18:47] we're playing pyro right so like look
[01:18:49] who tells
[01:18:50] oh swirl
[01:18:52] oh swirl oh
[01:18:54] oh swirl oh swirl
[01:18:57] okay that's pretty cool let's try uh
[01:18:59] let's try for a minute now
[01:19:10] this is gonna swirl then I E again
[01:19:23] swirl
[01:19:25] no swirl so if his both hits of his e
[01:19:28] share the same internal cooldown so like
[01:19:30] you could E1 and then wait like this
[01:19:33] should swirl twice if I do this and I
[01:19:34] wait
[01:19:35] no I do it again it's rolled both but
[01:19:37] like you're not gonna wait because it
[01:19:38] cool down is two seconds so
[01:19:40] both e hits have they share the same ICD
[01:19:44] so it's like
[01:19:46] yeah so you don't want to be like if
[01:19:49] you're reverse melting you'll melt like
[01:19:51] one out of your two e's basically like
[01:19:53] half of them
[01:19:57] um whereas shangling
[01:19:59] actually let's look at Shangri let's
[01:20:02] just see let's just see shinling okay
[01:20:05] swirl
[01:20:06] swirl swirl huh it looks as if she can
[01:20:10] vaporize with no ICD
[01:20:15] yeah so
[01:20:18] yeah unfortunate
[01:20:34] play it now not fair fine sure
[01:20:51] hello
[01:21:10] wait can I make purple books I think
[01:21:12] that's what I need right now yes I can't
[01:21:15] call if someone says
[01:21:34] [Music]
[01:21:47] so just stop adding me and then saying
[01:21:50] nothing
[01:21:51] what's up
[01:21:56] [Music]
[01:21:57] look at the situation they got me
[01:22:00] farming this is worth leveling for cryo
[01:22:03] but we're playing physical so it's just
[01:22:04] more cryo scaling so it's like not the
[01:22:06] biggest deal
[01:22:07] too much Theory crafting so we might as
[01:22:09] well save our mods for now I do want to
[01:22:10] play him cry as well but
[01:22:25] wait what the [ __ ] is this team I just
[01:22:27] realized
[01:22:36] yo can we get a shatter showcase
[01:22:41] do you know what's cool about feminine
[01:22:42] is that the people that want to see a
[01:22:44] physical team the people that want to
[01:22:45] see a shatter to you
[01:22:48] can get both with the same team we're
[01:22:51] playing true you can actually shatter in
[01:22:53] this team because Central freezes and
[01:22:55] you can superconduct with the electro
[01:22:57] character and then you just have
[01:22:58] dandruff Flex boom
[01:23:01] Paradise
[01:23:04] been fishing all my life foreign
[01:23:08] [Music]
[01:23:26] skill is fine too but Bruce is really
[01:23:28] important for your cookie not that big
[01:23:30] of a deal just make sure she's level 90
[01:23:31] type of Boom if it's official level her
[01:23:32] Oz Knight Rider uh and then dead rum C
[01:23:35] again her damage isn't the biggest deal
[01:23:36] but you can level the burst if it's
[01:23:38] nahida be sure to level her talents
[01:23:39] especially Skillman burst is also
[01:23:41] important uh and then you can level from
[01:23:43] A's skill and normal attacks if you're
[01:23:45] physical or burst if you're crying
[01:23:52] shut up
[01:24:16] [ __ ] we're almost the modernization this
[01:24:19] I mean that wasn't bad it was actually
[01:24:21] not bad
[01:24:24] all right he's in the shop you can buy
[01:24:26] him with [ __ ] star glitter
[01:24:29] or glitter then swipe
[01:24:31] swipe what's more important food
[01:24:35] your future or sing Cho exactly sincho
[01:24:39] sorry don't swipe don't save your
[01:24:42] save you can save your money
[01:24:49] all I'm saying is is is is is your all
[01:24:52] I'm saying
[01:24:53] all I'm saying is Synchro can definitely
[01:24:56] weave you a verse
[01:24:58] I don't know about something else I can
[01:25:08] he's really fun to use I agree I
[01:25:09] actually agree
[01:25:13] why did I do that
[01:25:17] I mean I guess you could use E1 before
[01:25:19] bursting there's no real reason not to I
[01:25:21] guess
[01:25:35] come on
[01:25:50] what
[01:25:51] oh we use the condensed but still wait
[01:25:54] that's actually the way W what the [ __ ]
[01:25:58] dude stop pigging me
[01:26:06] you're selling up
[01:26:25] what's this DPS was with Wolf's
[01:26:28] gravestone are you looking for a number
[01:26:29] 12 981
[01:26:38] okay
[01:26:46] per second
[01:26:48] DPS per second
[01:26:56] it might be able to level that I might
[01:26:58] just get seven eight [ __ ] it
[01:27:22] [ __ ] we're missing one book
[01:27:26] one book man
[01:27:28] I'll go again well Baba's weapons I did
[01:27:31] not choose one yet I'm debating between
[01:27:32] wolfang and uh the catalyst
[01:27:38] is just
[01:27:44] oh true sorry
[01:28:00] yeah Skyward pride is pretty good on
[01:28:02] them it's actually really good on him
[01:28:04] you get more motion values than his
[01:28:06] entire kit true
[01:28:10] do the [ __ ] vacuum blades are gonna
[01:28:12] do more than him
[01:28:22] nice one rotation
[01:28:27] could you be nice we're not even being
[01:28:29] mean to Promenade I'm just stating at
[01:28:31] the truth
[01:28:32] do I mean a lie I can lie
[01:28:40] okay well that was cool
[01:28:52] um normals might like low-key be better
[01:28:55] in a physical build because we normal a
[01:28:57] lot but I don't really care
[01:29:01] thank you
[01:29:20] okay guys
[01:29:47] he's your answer Central yeah
[01:29:52] they're usually replaced with like
[01:29:54] interchangeable
[01:30:01] alternatively if you have nahita here
[01:30:04] you can use the Elan instead of fermine
[01:30:17] I'm so broke okay let's uh let's go do
[01:30:21] this
[01:30:22] actually it's probably level can I have
[01:30:23] this verse one more time just it's not
[01:30:25] like complete trash
[01:30:27] I mean whatever
[01:30:41] isn't scarred probably one of his best
[01:30:42] weapons yeah it could be his best it's
[01:30:44] really good I just don't have it I mean
[01:30:46] serbian's really good too but yeah Scott
[01:30:47] pride is really good
[01:30:49] probably the most recommended option
[01:31:00] this guy's just hiding man
[01:31:10] I feel like attack goblet would be
[01:31:12] really good in this team
[01:31:14] because I know where the razor well
[01:31:16] Razer does more mixed damage than from a
[01:31:18] but
[01:31:20] I know what the razor attack all but is
[01:31:22] uh like better with a high refined
[01:31:24] servant spine
[01:31:27] but he does more Electro damage
[01:31:30] all right um
[01:31:32] looked both
[01:31:38] well the picture I guess we play him
[01:31:39] first and I hide from them but yeah I'm
[01:31:41] just playing first
[01:31:58] I could also
[01:32:01] wait
[01:32:03] are you playing dead drum C or nahida
[01:32:06] which one are we playing dims or nahida
[01:32:14] DMC okay what if we can't clear okay
[01:32:17] what is the best second half team I can
[01:32:19] play we need to speed run the [ __ ]
[01:32:21] second half we can play Lenny Lenny's
[01:32:23] pretty good here he just
[01:32:27] yeah we could play Lenny
[01:32:34] could be like a Lenny
[01:32:39] and then like changling
[01:32:43] uh we'll play strongly I don't have a
[01:32:44] shield
[01:32:45] and then first half we'll do
[01:32:50] actually [ __ ] Dale
[01:32:53] that first half will do
[01:32:56] from a net
[01:32:58] Syncro
[01:33:00] DMC
[01:33:02] and
[01:33:04] cookie
[01:33:07] yeah
[01:33:09] sure
[01:33:17] losing all the directions to shangling
[01:33:19] yeah well shangley is really good in
[01:33:21] this team but it's like
[01:33:22] it's hard to play Lenny without a shield
[01:33:24] or a resistance Interruption like you
[01:33:26] have to like low-key quick swap or just
[01:33:27] dodge every attack which you can do but
[01:33:29] I don't have to like reset because it's
[01:33:31] second half
[01:33:32] uh I do think zhangly's better here
[01:33:34] though we'll play zhangi
[01:33:36] Dale's just cool
[01:33:41] why not yao yao slow dendro
[01:33:44] I mean dead drums is not the fastest
[01:33:46] either but yeah yeah that was really
[01:33:47] like not
[01:33:48] the best
[01:33:51] from all field I mean you could onfield
[01:33:53] her I mean I'm sure yeah yeah onfield
[01:33:54] would be better but
[01:33:56] whatever
[01:34:04] all right
[01:34:06] sir Robbins
[01:34:09] what does Remini do in this team
[01:34:10] emotional support no so okay okay no
[01:34:13] memes okay memes aside full memes aside
[01:34:16] we'll I'll talk about this while the
[01:34:17] serpent spines knocks up okay memes
[01:34:19] aside
[01:34:20] also he needs emotional support we're
[01:34:22] trying to cheer him up but no all names
[01:34:25] aside freminet wants to be played with a
[01:34:28] Hydra support so that you can shatter
[01:34:30] because shatter Buffs him also look at
[01:34:31] the penguin so that's actually [ __ ]
[01:34:33] adorable okay and then he also also
[01:34:35] played with an electro support so you
[01:34:37] can super conduct and buff his damage so
[01:34:38] at that point this is already from an a
[01:34:40] team and then you just put dendro type
[01:34:42] of blue
[01:34:51] man [ __ ] the maku kinky though
[01:34:55] [Music]
[01:34:57] that's enough
[01:35:12] um
[01:35:14] I actually dodged I would not I would
[01:35:18] not just say that for like funny
[01:35:25] bro give me a [ __ ]
[01:35:42] foreign
[01:36:00] shut the frick up man shut the frick up

[01:37:16] flick off those guys let's go
[01:37:18] just 90 degrees

[01:39:01] answers at the start let me do that

[01:44:39] we cleared
[01:44:46] we're not doing this that's not
[01:44:48] happening but we didn't clear first half
[01:44:49] a tournament hey that was bad you know

[01:44:52] that's okay
[01:44:54] we did okay
[01:44:56] we did okay

[01:45:39] I can give myself a better weapon
[01:45:41] [Music]

[01:46:31] aware
[01:46:41] okay I'm gonna do uh a few other uh
[01:46:43] basically we're gonna do like at least
[01:46:44] two of his clears the first one we're
[01:46:46] gonna do is probably the exact same team
[01:46:47] because I felt like I played bad so I
[01:46:49] want to do a bit better
[01:46:51] um but we could have changed the we
[01:46:53] could change like the dendro character
[01:46:55] actually no I want to play MC again
[01:46:56] we're gonna do the same thing then we're
[01:46:58] gonna change it
[01:47:03] um we'll do one more clear with the same
[01:47:05] team and then we'll swap
[01:47:14] what about from an akons basically just
[01:47:15] gives him more damage tldr
[01:47:18] which is like you know it's okay uh I
[01:47:21] don't know how much freemony contributes
[01:47:23] to his team damage overall but having
[01:47:25] more is is is is is is is is nice
[01:47:32] what if we play Lenny farzan
[01:47:36] wait Lenny Bennett right we have double
[01:47:38] pyro farzan to swirl and then Xiao
[01:47:42] good take
[01:47:53] care
[01:47:58] and then we use four emblem Lenny as a
[01:48:01] burst support

[01:55:04] she missed it
[01:55:08] watch us watch this linear rotation
[01:55:10] watch this linear rotation
[01:55:19] meaning golfing lightning is technically
[01:55:21] optimal if you think about it
[01:55:30] [Music]
[01:55:36] that's it
[01:55:44] I really know
[01:55:53] [ __ ] it's not Showtime
[01:56:07] all right not bad not bad so far so good
[01:56:08] so far so good
[01:56:10] twelve three
[01:56:20] yeah I do feel like you end up losing a
[01:56:22] lot of servant spine stacks on him
[01:56:23] unless you're good but I'm bad so I do
[01:56:25] end up losing some uh but I'd still it
[01:56:28] still has to be his best five star
[01:56:29] though especially the refines
[01:56:37] like there's no other [ __ ] oh let's
[01:56:40] say five star I meant to say four star
[01:56:41] obviously it's worse than some fives but
[01:56:43] yeah when are you going to get a haircut
[01:56:47] never
[01:56:49] uh please give energy
[01:56:52] thank you
[01:56:54] what
[01:56:57] I forgot you're supposed to attack the
[01:56:58] [ __ ] stupid fire dudes first I forgot
[01:57:01] the dash backwards I forgot
[01:57:19] just use five I don't want to use fav
[01:57:27] thing why did you just send me a YouTube
[01:57:28] link
[01:57:30] I don't want to open this
[01:57:35] I'm afraid
[01:57:37] wait this doesn't look bad what is this
[01:57:49] all the questions we had the one that
[01:57:52] came up most often was asked Benedict to
[01:57:57] say the word penguin
[01:58:00] what is this about well apparently I got
[01:58:02] it wrong repeatedly in the documentary
[01:58:04] and now I'm completely terrified of the
[01:58:06] words
[01:58:07] um I Don't Go Near it the first one you
[01:58:09] sort of get away with and then after
[01:58:10] that you lose all sense
[01:58:13] let's let's have a look listen carefully
[01:58:15] and the last thing you might expect to
[01:58:18] see here
[01:58:22] is Penguins that's not that bad
[01:58:25] fjordland crested Penguins named after
[01:58:28] this corner of South New Zealand
[01:58:30] so why are these woodlands so attractive
[01:58:33] to Penguins okay
[01:58:36] through the forest makes a handy Highway
[01:58:39] for a parrot penguin heading home from
[01:58:42] the fishing trip
[01:58:43] well why are we even on YouTube shorts
[01:58:47] why were you even on YouTube shorts what
[01:58:50] happens if I scroll
[01:58:55] baby I mean it's all right like
[01:58:58] get out of here
[01:59:00] yeah what okay this person I don't even
[01:59:02] want to start it never mind what the
[01:59:04] [ __ ] was that take what the [ __ ] was
[01:59:06] that take wait a second this person's
[01:59:08] slendering leeway and dragon spine
[01:59:12] what does this take what the [ __ ] is
[01:59:14] that take watch you're gonna be like
[01:59:16] inazuma's amazing sumus whatever
[01:59:18] watch
[01:59:20] it it was perfect yeah perfect perfect
[01:59:23] by the way perfect exploration and argon
[01:59:25] Quest by the way true good take YouTube
[01:59:27] shorts
[01:59:31] okay I mean that's okay that kind of
[01:59:33] feels kind of based
[01:59:35] goat out let's go what
[01:59:39] Chasm goats what the [ __ ]
[01:59:47] oh yeah baby I mean it's all right yes I
[01:59:50] told you yeah okay that's the worst
[01:59:52] thing I've ever seen yeah deserts ass
[01:59:55] but sooner was so good
[01:59:59] the desert is okay desert is actual I
[02:00:01] hate it but the [ __ ] Subaru itself is
[02:00:03] so good
[02:00:09] I guess so bad what the [ __ ] I like okay
[02:00:11] okay let me rephrase my anchor take
[02:00:14] as the worst Explorer in the world so
[02:00:16] take this with a grain of salt I think
[02:00:18] enca's music and lore are really good
[02:00:19] but playing enca itself is not very fun
[02:00:23] but that's that's what I think
[02:00:27] like I like the vibe and I like like the
[02:00:30] the like [ __ ] behind it but exploring it
[02:00:33] sometimes I'll just like uh
[02:00:39] I love the desert Frick you
[02:00:42] um I like the idea of the desert I just
[02:00:44] could never okay
[02:00:46] I don't know it's not like
[02:00:50] I don't know I [ __ ] hate I it's not
[02:00:52] that I don't like it it's that there's
[02:00:54] so much dude I like it like
[02:00:59] and it all looks like it just looks like
[02:01:02] desert and then more desert and then
[02:01:03] more desert
[02:01:06] I don't know
[02:01:16] what
[02:01:30] that's what a desert is
[02:01:32] yeah
[02:01:33] true that is what a desert is
[02:01:43] another basement look darker than usual
[02:01:44] dude every light is broken broken the
[02:01:47] broken
[02:01:58] up
[02:02:04] can I get my burst
[02:02:09] what I have no [ __ ] energy
[02:02:24] no no I'm not even gonna joke on that
[02:02:26] Banner
[02:03:01] um
[02:03:04] well that was definitely a rotation of
[02:03:06] all time
[02:03:07] I mean
[02:03:09] I don't know if that could have gone
[02:03:10] worse I'm gonna be honest uh I don't
[02:03:12] know how that could have gone worse
[02:03:14] no this is not a randomizer team
[02:03:20] oh
[02:03:34] my God
[02:03:46] what
[02:03:59] like I don't even know how I'm supposed
[02:04:01] to play without his [ __ ] verse I
[02:04:03] can't do anything
[02:04:07] okay I'm not gonna wait for certain spot
[02:04:09] I don't really care
[02:04:12] I don't have my skill okay I guess I do
[02:04:14] care I only have [ __ ] signal skill

[02:05:23] you're supposed to attack the other dude
[02:05:25] not her but
[02:05:32] okay he's very single Target anyways so
[02:05:35] I don't think it really matters
[02:05:36] what's up
[02:05:38] what's Cookie's cooldown seven seconds
[02:05:40] let's wait seven seconds
[02:05:42] I'm not my [ __ ] burst anyways
[02:05:45] fav
[02:05:50] s
[02:05:56] why he's getting pushed out of the
[02:05:58] circle
[02:06:03] that's fine that's not that's not
[02:06:05] terrible
[02:06:33] thank you
[02:06:50] what is this team it's meta
[02:06:58] so we have nothing to swirl by like to
[02:07:01] work with Lenny
[02:07:19] this is a team Nori
[02:07:25] okay so much anymore as man
[02:07:28] surely my punches do more than 65k
[02:07:35] okay I mean that was that I'm sure
[02:07:37] there's a 413 no there is not
[02:07:39] unfortunate
[02:07:41] okay I can I know my lighting's [ __ ]
[02:07:43] today but I feel like even if I turn the
[02:07:46] backlight on it's still dog [ __ ] like I
[02:07:48] feel like this isn't even much better
[02:07:49] but I don't know if it helps it helps
[02:07:52] challenge ended
[02:07:57] well I shot when a golfing lightning
[02:07:59] um
[02:08:00] because we are an exploration gamer
[02:08:03] 666-22
[02:08:25] okay
[02:08:27] um I mean I mean that was the cool clip
[02:08:31] I guess or not clip but like clear we
[02:08:33] could play feminated full physical but I
[02:08:36] don't think it will be a fun time if I'm
[02:08:38] being completely honest
[02:08:41] um
[02:08:43] but maybe I shouldn't be honest
[02:08:48] [Music]
[02:09:01] you could do 12 one I guess
[02:09:30] what
[02:09:31] yep
[02:10:09] thank you
[02:10:12] he's gonna Dash backwards so I don't
[02:10:14] want to [ __ ] bend it all tears about
[02:10:15] the dash okay
[02:10:28] can do that okay that's fine
[02:10:31] [Music]
[02:10:53] shatter against magu on
[02:10:58] um
[02:11:16] what
[02:11:18] the [ __ ] wait did it we oh I did not
[02:11:22] click on that what the [ __ ] just
[02:11:24] happened
[02:11:28] okay that was not my fault
[02:11:33] dude I did not click on that
[02:11:54] this seemed like works I think
[02:12:04] he doesn't really do much but like it
[02:12:07] works
[02:12:08] it's just not really like like he's not
[02:12:12] really doing much here
[02:12:17] um we could do like did my caffeine's
[02:12:21] wearing off I need to make another
[02:12:22] coffee we could do like [ __ ]
[02:12:24] what is it called we could we could do
[02:12:26] like a domain where something can
[02:12:27] actually be frozen
[02:12:29] because magu hanky you can't shatter
[02:12:36] wait let me look at the other way
[02:12:38] actually
[02:12:41] new event oh yeah we could do the event
[02:12:43] actually
[02:12:54] like this one
[02:12:58] I love day two
[02:13:00] okay during day two cabalitative I mean
[02:13:02] it's a rune enemy hey man love the
[02:13:05] stream when is the cooking stream coming
[02:13:07] though
[02:13:08] um
[02:13:17] well how many enemies are in this event
[02:13:20] I assume it's a bunch of Rune enemies
[02:13:21] right if it is then that should work
[02:13:32] but he has like I mean obviously enemies
[02:13:35] have high physical rights but
[02:13:37] another
[02:13:41] at least you can freeze
[02:13:48] dude why is the sun in my face
[02:14:07] oh no these guys are too low HP
[02:14:12] yeah no these guys are terrible for this
[02:14:16] I'm gonna try it
[02:14:30] yeah these guys are terrible for it
[02:14:36] wait let me try the other one
[02:15:02] penguin
[02:15:15] so this this
[02:15:20] this
[02:15:23] yes
[02:15:30] come
[02:15:34] on I mean this like works it's not like
[02:15:36] ideal but
[02:15:42] oh [ __ ] I thought
[02:15:48] wait that penguin missed the [ __ ]
[02:15:50] Rune guard I guess it just didn't create
[02:15:52] probably
[02:16:05] oh
[02:16:10] okay
[02:16:15] can I do that next one
[02:16:17] we'll see if I can clear the max
[02:16:19] difficulty
[02:16:33] he's very single Target unfortunately
[02:16:38] I've also lost all of my serpent stacks
[02:16:41] [Music]
[02:16:45] oh I have no energy holy [ __ ]
[02:16:51] [Music]
[02:16:59] oh that was they're weird
[02:17:04] [Music]
[02:17:38] I mean
[02:17:40] that was like
[02:17:44] it's like Eula if Eula doesn't use her
[02:17:46] bursts
[02:17:50] this is literally like if you're playing
[02:17:51] normal tacula
[02:17:57] come on
[02:18:01] because
[02:18:05] like when I talk about this team I just
[02:18:08] say just why not play [ __ ] hyperbloom
[02:18:10] genuinely and I want to make sure I'm
[02:18:11] not being too harsh by saying that
[02:18:15] um but for reference let's see the
[02:18:17] difference that just putting like a
[02:18:20] um nahida instead of Bennett and you
[02:18:22] might be like oh of course the heat is
[02:18:23] broken but so is Bennett so it's not
[02:18:25] like it's like it's not like she's even
[02:18:27] higher value
[02:18:44] my bad
[02:18:50] Whoopsie Daisy
[02:19:04] uh let me reset my recording thing one
[02:19:07] sec
[02:19:13] oh wait I don't have [ __ ] dude why
[02:19:14] does it give me
[02:19:16] give me uh we'll just wait it's fine
[02:19:39] [ __ ]
[02:19:41] okay
[02:19:43] [Music]
[02:19:59] I mean even here it's like
[02:20:05] there's definitely better but it's also
[02:20:08] like why the [ __ ] am I doing this
[02:20:17] beautiful
[02:20:22] oh okay
[02:20:25] okay
[02:20:28] [Music]
[02:20:38] what the [ __ ]
[02:20:48] faded
[02:21:00] chocolate
[02:21:04] I just wanna uh use this all because
[02:21:20] can I get my alts what the [ __ ]
[02:21:23] it
[02:21:40] come on
[02:21:43] [Music]
[02:21:45] yeah
[02:21:47] [Music]
[02:21:50] I mean
[02:22:02] come here
[02:22:07] that's a decent attempt
[02:22:11] yeah
[02:22:13] that was an attempt
[02:22:19] double with a lot of tries yeah but we
[02:22:23] don't need to we don't need to with
[02:22:25] tremina
[02:22:27] um I think I still think this is a lot
[02:22:29] better than the non-nakita team
[02:22:32] but I mean Beto might actually just be
[02:22:34] better because Beto's Beto
[02:22:41] me and try playing cryo after
[02:22:48] okay
[02:22:58] foreign
[02:23:04] [Music]
[02:23:09] this is just [ __ ] taser
[02:23:13] I don't know if I want to play this is
[02:23:14] my very even geared
[02:23:18] what the [ __ ] Shawn
[02:23:45] a
[02:23:48] Lucia block
[02:23:53] to the phone
[02:24:09] look
[02:24:12] up
[02:24:27] where the [ __ ] are they because they're
[02:24:30] hiding man
[02:24:32] that's it
[02:24:36] benefits
[02:24:49] thank you
[02:24:54] okay
[02:24:57] try this one
[02:25:08] uh let's do this
[02:25:12] all right on my [ __ ] burst
[02:25:15] [Music]
[02:25:16] oh this guy's either
[02:25:23] tragedy let me just reset or like wait
[02:25:26] then
[02:25:28] foreign
[02:26:04] this this
[02:26:07] did my bursts are so not lined up it's
[02:26:10] actually like stupid
[02:26:25] [ __ ] miss there's no way the penguin
[02:26:29] missed
[02:26:39] what's up
[02:26:43] bro can I get my I don't have fish
[02:26:46] results
[02:26:48] unlucky okay let me just get energy
[02:27:19] all right let's go again
[02:27:23] see if we can make anything of this
[02:27:25] [Music]
[02:27:28] I have to use my skill on everyone
[02:27:53] foreign
[02:28:02] [Music]
[02:28:24] and then we don't have our burst
[02:28:32] I thought that would kill him
[02:28:56] okay dude what is happening it's fine I
[02:29:01] actually need this on my eyes yeah
[02:29:08] yeah this feels disgusting I don't know
[02:29:10] why you would play without hyperboom
[02:29:11] though if I'm being honest
[02:29:15] uh we can try a cryo build
[02:29:20] but I need to level this burst for that
[02:29:26] um
[02:29:44] I'm shutting stuff down
[02:30:03] it's okay though
[02:30:06] um I also think you just playing
[02:30:07] hyperblum here let me try a cryo build
[02:30:11] this is depressing let's try a crowd
[02:30:13] builds
[02:30:21] I don't have golden uh this is just
[02:30:26] foreign
[02:30:47] is just sad because his scaling suck
[02:30:50] maybe he saw his kid in a sad
[02:30:54] wait what am I going for him in essence
[02:30:55] the [ __ ] uh
[02:31:10] [ __ ] it we'll use our [ __ ] same one
[02:31:13] Sans
[02:31:15] wait let me just see okay
[02:31:21] do I have a good crowd goblet
[02:31:25] okay
[02:31:27] oh we have no [ __ ] ER surely we don't
[02:31:30] need Dr right
[02:31:36] look at the aroms no I'm in Nightmare
[02:31:37] Zone
[02:31:38] foreign
[02:31:41] also I'd have to repair it it's also
[02:31:43] just the top you have literally vertices
[02:31:45] bottoms
[02:31:57] well I'm gonna do this
[02:31:59] and then I'm gonna do
[02:32:03] an ER
[02:32:04] flour sure they have a flower that has
[02:32:06] ER right
[02:32:10] there you go
[02:32:14] surely 130 is enough right surely it
[02:32:16] doesn't need more we're probably double
[02:32:18] dude if we're playing double cryo needs
[02:32:20] more than 130 I give up there's no way
[02:32:22] there's actually no way if we're double
[02:32:24] cryo there's no [ __ ] way okay we're
[02:32:26] gonna play Kaya Bennett shangling I
[02:32:29] think we kind of [ __ ] Kyle's build so
[02:32:30] let's play Rosaria instead
[02:32:37] right
[02:32:38] where's Rosaria cheers
[02:32:44] uh we do need to love those burst though
[02:32:46] it needs to be at least six
[02:32:48] but we'll just play it for now then
[02:32:50] we'll level it
[02:32:54] let me just see what happens
[02:33:00] oh my God we have no energy holy [ __ ]
[02:33:12] ER
[02:33:23] he also tried in Abyss but if this is
[02:33:25] magu Kanki I don't know how I feel about
[02:33:27] that
[02:33:27] I guess second half I [ __ ] it let's just
[02:33:30] use everything this
[02:33:34] bulldog
[02:33:35] might as well Eon Bennett no we can't
[02:33:38] quick swap anymore which is unfortunate
[02:33:52] I mean that wasn't even like that was
[02:33:55] you know it was okay wait he said the
[02:33:57] same thing over and over what the [ __ ]
[02:33:59] was he saying
[02:34:01] wait let me say this to [ __ ] English
[02:34:27] pair
[02:34:32] don't die don't die don't die okay
[02:34:37] pear Frost is coming wait uh [ __ ]
[02:34:41] child says disappear
[02:34:44] and then for a minute just this pair
[02:34:49] um
[02:34:56] you can't run
[02:34:58] but you've been [ __ ] burst
[02:35:02] s
[02:35:04] getting here
[02:35:07] get in here prepared getting here
[02:35:13] here getting here
[02:35:19] um
[02:35:20] let's go to the abyss right now I can't
[02:35:22] think of a single reason why I would do
[02:35:24] that over playing Kaya but let's go see
[02:35:27] if the abyss changes my mind teleport
[02:35:29] currently disabled okay
[02:35:48] yes I am in pain
[02:35:54] uh let me make sure Rosario is geared
[02:36:00] she has no em but whatever
[02:36:03] oh dude I'm coping it's fine we'll play
[02:36:06] it in the second half right and play
[02:36:08] second half here
[02:36:10] yeah okay nothing
[02:36:15] although we can't shatter in this team
[02:36:17] at all
[02:36:19] um which makes me wonder if
[02:36:22] it's even worth running a second cryo or
[02:36:24] if you would do like [ __ ] frema
[02:36:27] National
[02:36:29] I don't want to think about feminate
[02:36:32] okay
[02:36:43] okay let me I'm actually okay okay
[02:36:47] should I I should probably level this
[02:36:49] burst
[02:36:51] so that it doesn't suck
[02:36:57] it's gonna suck anyways it's gonna suck
[02:36:58] anyways it's gonna suck anyways
[02:37:19] that's strong half
[02:37:21] I'm also kind of tired but it's all good
[02:37:24] we'll do this and then first off we'll
[02:37:26] do
[02:37:29] I don't know if my hotel is geared
[02:37:32] kinda don't want to risk it but
[02:37:34] whatever
[02:37:48] okay
[02:37:57] body and mind

[02:40:34] sorry this
[02:40:36] that was disgusting there's no reason to
[02:40:39] ever play in there instead of Kaya that
[02:40:41] was actually disgusting I don't know
[02:40:43] that was terrible
[02:40:46] I'm gonna be honest that was disgusting
[02:40:48] I'm Fair

[02:41:52] kaching
[02:41:57] I do still enjoy this playstyle uh but
[02:42:00] you have the planet hyperbloom I don't
[02:42:01] know I don't see a reason to ever run
[02:42:03] him in any other team ever at all ever
[02:42:05] genuinely I really don't like maybe
[02:42:09] Synchro official Beto and then it's like
[02:42:12] sure but like
[02:42:19] pear
[02:42:22] let me lose anything it's very bad yes
[02:42:25] but like he's fun so you know I mean it

[02:43:21] what the [ __ ] is this verit
[02:43:33] uh I don't know how wise it is to open
[02:43:35] up a Google doc on stream if I'm being
[02:43:37] honest
[02:44:04] bro
[02:44:05] this guy's hiding here
[02:44:09] was this garbage hiding
[02:44:19] [ __ ] is this guy doing dumb kid grow up
[02:44:23] sorry that was mean
[02:44:43] yeah I don't know why is this up and on
[02:44:45] stream but where do you even DM me
[02:44:50] uh okay let's go do probably just do I
[02:44:55] have to test any other team or can I
[02:44:56] just
[02:44:58] dude the more I play on the sadder I get
[02:45:00] okay I was having fun with hyperbloom
[02:45:02] the second I switched off it I got more
[02:45:04] and more sad so I I I I I I I I I I okay
[02:45:08] is there is there okay
[02:45:11] foreign
[02:45:16] with Mika no why would I ever do that to
[02:45:18] myself I'm gonna say he's gonna
[02:45:20] hyperloom and if not you can play this
[02:45:21] team with the last stop being Banner
[02:45:22] Mika or Beto I'm just gonna say it but
[02:45:24] I'm never gonna play it because it's
[02:45:25] [ __ ] disgusting but if you want to do
[02:45:27] it you can and it'll be fine it won't be
[02:45:29] fine but it'll probably still clear
[02:45:31] because the other units are broken
[02:45:39] C6 channel oh wait true actually
[02:45:42] shanna's actually not even a bad call
[02:45:50] thank you
[02:45:55] I mean she does give you Buffs
[02:46:12] looking why are you looking
[02:46:19] So Physical Shadow is not bad
[02:46:21] um I mean I believe you I believe that
[02:46:24] Shanna has a use here uh I don't
[02:46:27] disagree I just don't think there's a
[02:46:28] reason to do this over
[02:46:31] like if you're gonna the only thing is
[02:46:34] like if you're gonna run him
[02:46:38] where is he if you're gonna run him with
[02:46:40] hydro and Electro anyways you like might
[02:46:43] as well hyperbloom is the only thing he
[02:46:45] might as well
[02:46:48] um
[02:46:57] but yeah
[02:47:01] you don't have to run electron cryo
[02:47:03] build yeah but if you're playing cryo
[02:47:04] build then it's like
[02:47:07] okay I mean yeah you can CR like yeah
[02:47:11] yeah you could do like
[02:47:13] keep it like what is your team I mean
[02:47:16] you could do like yeah you could do like
[02:47:18] this
[02:47:18] exactly is teamwork you can do this
[02:47:22] make sure but then it's like what are
[02:47:24] you even playing like
[02:47:28] like this I mean sure look at that
[02:47:33] this
[02:47:37] it'll probably do fine honestly
[02:47:45] but the crowd for me doesn't really get
[02:47:48] to normal attack mod well you I guess
[02:47:49] you do one you just lose it on some
[02:47:50] Synchro stuff you could put I guess
[02:47:52] kokomi here would be better
[02:47:55] uh we could do this it's just an ayaka
[02:47:57] team we're supposed to be playing a
[02:47:58] [ __ ] ayaka team
[02:48:00] uh okay sure whatever [ __ ] it happy 16
[02:48:03] months I zero X shizer okay I guess
[02:48:12] let's do this
[02:48:25] wait you can't even swap into kokomi to
[02:48:27] use reversed
[02:48:30] wow 20K damage
[02:48:37] I mean okay shanna's not geared let me
[02:48:39] let me gear her
[02:48:50] that was so bad that was I don't even
[02:48:53] want to think about that but let me give
[02:48:55] her a tax that she's not like a bad girl
[02:48:57] like she's just a lot better uh we'll
[02:48:59] give her a bless
[02:49:01] give her four in a blast because we want
[02:49:02] that on our team and as much attack as
[02:49:05] we can muster uh energy recharge is good
[02:49:08] but for the sake of this let's say [ __ ]
[02:49:09] I mean we'll get some Er I want to be
[02:49:12] able to burst still if we can
[02:49:15] foreign
[02:49:19] should I tap or hold e
[02:49:24] wait where is it
[02:49:27] yeah let's hold oh no let's practice
[02:49:29] skill
[02:49:30] yeah just stop it
[02:49:32] okay I need to get my burst back I don't
[02:49:35] know how that's gonna happen but
[02:49:35] whatever
[02:49:39] Unleashed
[02:49:48] I'll just get my burst first okay
[02:49:52] hopefully I don't die when I swap here
[02:50:02] okay
[02:50:04] I'm gonna wait then we're gonna go
[02:50:11] crying this might as well burst
[02:50:15] just like high on this team I know but
[02:50:17] yeah
[02:50:21] okay I mean
[02:50:23] uh my fault I guess my fault I guess
[02:50:28] dude just [ __ ] freeze man
[02:50:35] you can't even call me burst in this
[02:50:37] team because you can't swap out of from
[02:50:38] an A so she needs to be on like a
[02:50:40] [ __ ] well I guess no no you don't
[02:50:42] need ER but like you just need to wait
[02:50:43] for your skill which is fine I guess but
[02:50:46] it's annoying
[02:50:48] I shall
[02:50:49] not I'm just gonna use food I don't
[02:50:51] understand
[02:50:55] could call me I mean
[02:51:02] is on uh em build right now so she might
[02:51:04] be on stock I'm not sure
[02:51:09] okay let me just get my burst and then
[02:51:11] we'll reset
[02:51:19] okay
[02:51:22] [Music]
[02:51:25] I know I'm trying to just do as much
[02:51:27] damage [ __ ] the ER I just want to do
[02:51:29] damage right now I just want to see if
[02:51:30] like hey
[02:51:32] come
[02:51:42] here
[02:51:46] fun okay okay for the record we actually
[02:51:50] have stats like it's not like we're like
[02:51:52] we're not on the best build but like we
[02:51:54] actually do have stats like dude
[02:52:03] oh my God that is so bad
[02:52:13] I just have more defense here I mean
[02:52:15] yeah I know like I know this isn't the
[02:52:17] best place to use it I just don't wanna

[02:52:29] like
[02:52:32] like it'll be better
[02:52:34] but it won't be good
[02:52:36] I'll show you

[02:55:27] a coffee because I'm tired and then
[02:55:29] we're back
[02:55:30] okay he's back he
[02:55:36] okay
[02:55:37] uh oh it's [ __ ] these [ __ ] enemies
[02:55:40] I mean I guess they're gonna be Perma
[02:55:41] Frozen so cool well like shattered I
[02:55:44] guess
[02:55:47] whatever let's just test it here
[02:55:50] I'm gonna cause it all too because we
[02:55:52] need all the help we can get
[02:56:03] it wow this feels so much better than
[02:56:05] the event we just did I'm so glad that
[02:56:08] someone pointed out that we should
[02:56:09] change testing grounds this really makes
[02:56:11] them feel like a good character
[02:56:29] getting gear s
[02:56:39] I did
[02:56:46] wow I actually don't have my burst
[02:56:49] I guess I should call me to heal give
[02:56:51] thrilling tails to them might as well
[02:56:52] get throwing kills you know give them
[02:56:53] the benefit of the benefit
[02:57:04] s I'm gonna clear this floor I I don't
[02:57:07] care how long it takes
[02:57:10] already dead
[02:57:26] yeah
[02:57:29] cryo incarnate on my time
[02:57:36] we died
[02:57:42] getting here
[02:57:47] I'm getting here
[02:57:49] yeah
[02:57:50] [Music]
[02:57:52] I mean I mean
[02:58:00] so okay
[02:58:03] okay
[02:58:06] he did not feel
[02:58:10] nearly as bad with hyperbloom that's all
[02:58:13] I'm saying
[02:58:14] like he still was bad like he still
[02:58:16] wasn't like meta but it's like he feels
[02:58:19] way better with hyperbloom like so much
[02:58:22] better
[02:58:23] like I guess maybe it's just like
[02:58:26] yeah I don't know dude no [ __ ] yeah but
[02:58:29] also like his kid already synergizes
[02:58:31] hyperboom because it's like yes any
[02:58:34] character will be good with hyperloom
[02:58:35] but it's like he wants a hydro support
[02:58:37] because of this where is he because of
[02:58:40] this and he wants an electric support
[02:58:42] for superconduct so it's like you you
[02:58:43] already have like even for primitive
[02:58:47] himself let's say hyperloom wasn't even
[02:58:48] that good even for him you would already
[02:58:51] have hydro intellectual so then the last
[02:58:54] thought could be dendro anyways even if
[02:58:56] it's not just like oh hi everyone's
[02:58:57] broken which it is like with Eula
[02:58:59] hyperbloom it's like oh she's about to
[02:59:02] play hyperboom but with from an a it's
[02:59:03] like yeah he's bad but also it's like he
[02:59:05] already has Synergy with Hydro here he
[02:59:07] has energy with Electro and then
[02:59:09] hyperlum's broken so you might as well
[02:59:10] basically
[02:59:15] foreign
[02:59:26] like look I'll do a even in cry like
[02:59:28] okay you should play physical with
[02:59:30] hyperboom because you Auto attack more
[02:59:31] and you get more [ __ ] what and you get
[02:59:34] more uh uh uh damage because of
[02:59:37] superconduct crowd team there's no rest
[02:59:39] red like your crowd damage build No Rest
[02:59:41] red but your superconduct team I mean
[02:59:43] your physical build will have
[02:59:45] superconduct because it's the same team
[02:59:47] and the team is going to prox
[02:59:48] superconduct anyways but if you're in a
[02:59:49] crowd build you can't make use of it
[02:59:52] um so we're in a crowd build right now
[02:59:54] but and our birth is only like low
[02:59:56] Talent level
[02:59:57] but even despite that I think it'll
[03:00:00] still be
[03:00:02] um not ideal but definitely way [ __ ]
[03:00:05] better than the freeze thing we just did
[03:00:08] I'll just do it short very quickly
[03:00:14] hello

[03:01:46] don't reply to anything and I just like
[03:01:48] turbo grind it and then I need like a
[03:01:50] day period afterward I just become a
[03:01:52] rodent and then I don't I still am not
[03:01:54] healthy and then I just do whatever I
[03:01:55] need to do and then after that it's back
[03:01:57] to like another cycle especially because
[03:01:58] now there's star real and again Shin so

[03:03:23] I think we had a pale flame flower
[03:03:27] if I can find it [ __ ] Bill
[03:03:29] flame that is
[03:03:32] and then a Blood Stained feather
[03:03:37] a gilded Sands
[03:03:48] Blood Stained
[03:03:50] all right all right now
[03:03:54] all right we're pogging
[03:04:01] we'll have no healer here but surely we
[03:04:03] won't need it it's fine
[03:04:13] [ __ ] I'm at the heel official I'm just
[03:04:15] healing them all because I don't die I
[03:04:17] have no energy though so let's wait
[03:04:29] wow this guy is not getting his [ __ ]
[03:04:31] verse back
[03:04:39] getting here
[03:04:42] okay uh we'll do this
[03:04:46] this
[03:04:48] wish me on this Reckoning
[03:04:53] and like it'll it'll probably be fine
[03:04:59] like you know
[03:05:02] moderate
[03:05:04] it's like okay
[03:05:06] this this this this this
[03:05:14] like you know it's like we're working
[03:05:18] getting here
[03:05:20] hey
[03:05:22] brother come
[03:05:27] it works
[03:05:29] but I do prefer dendro there but it
[03:05:31] definitely works
[03:05:43] kind of I guess
[03:05:51] the joy in your voice
[03:05:53] yeah
[03:06:06] hair
[03:06:12] I mean like this is fine
[03:06:17] hair
[03:06:23] a lot of it is the off field supports
[03:06:26] doing work but like you know team's
[03:06:29] working out
[03:06:31] he is very Button Mash intensive okay
[03:06:34] that wasn't my fault
[03:06:45] oh
[03:06:52] [Music]
[03:07:10] pause champion
[03:07:25] foreign
[03:07:31] but also it's only plus four so you
[03:07:34] never know right you never know it could
[03:07:35] roll just a bunch of crew damage and
[03:07:37] then suddenly
[03:07:40] today is not a good day today is not a
[03:07:43] good day uh uh I mean
[03:07:46] Albedo peace I guess if it gets crew
[03:07:50] damage again Albedo could use it
[03:07:53] um
[03:08:01] I don't know if I want to level that
[03:08:03] anymore
[03:08:08] wow that is atrocious
[03:08:16] can Pingu boy use snow tomb yes anything
[03:08:18] that adds scalings anything that adds
[03:08:20] motion values to his kit is good because
[03:08:23] of how those numbers are
[03:08:37] you're doing all right no
[03:08:47] okay okay I actually so in it before I
[03:08:50] started stream I felt like cryo was okay
[03:08:52] but the more I play them the more I'm
[03:08:54] like why would you ever go cryo like
[03:08:56] usually you think okay cryo is better
[03:08:58] than physical because physical sucks but
[03:09:00] like physical gives you free
[03:09:01] superconduct because you want to be
[03:09:02] shattering anyways so you might as well
[03:09:04] run Electro and then it gives you access
[03:09:05] to either hyperbloom or a good offfield
[03:09:07] support
[03:09:09] so I actually don't see the purpose of
[03:09:11] cryo anymore like I'll still mention the
[03:09:13] build and stuff but I actually don't see
[03:09:14] the point because reverse melt feels
[03:09:16] disgusting compared to like Kaya
[03:09:21] and then it's like freeze you can't even
[03:09:23] freeze you're just shattering but
[03:09:24] Shadow's not even a good reaction so
[03:09:25] it's like yeah you can shatter but why
[03:09:27] not just hyperbloom with chatter
[03:09:36] and you can't normal attack and like you
[03:09:38] can't normal attack as much in the cryo
[03:09:39] build so you get less thing Cho
[03:09:44] yeah wait what if you go deepwood
[03:09:46] Premiere deepwood and fav
[03:09:52] and then Nikita goes gilded or a golden
[03:09:55] Troop
[03:10:01] dude you go deep wood you're still doing
[03:10:04] damage but you let your nahida go on
[03:10:06] [ __ ]
[03:10:08] um uh uh uh uh golden troop Golden
[03:10:10] Corral
[03:10:19] it's time to stop Mr socks okay
[03:10:25] dude I'm cooking though I'm cooking
[03:10:39] okay I do need to record those parts
[03:10:40] then
[03:10:42] um
[03:10:44] okay I think I know what I'll talk about
[03:10:46] honey positive yet will you pull uh one
[03:10:49] on the first run and then we'll see how
[03:10:51] we like them I'm definitely I'm
[03:10:52] definitely getting them but I don't need
[03:10:53] to see sex them to show my
[03:10:56] respect and admiration for him
[03:11:00] what the [ __ ] is this it's an event
[03:11:03] oh it is tabletop Adventure bat chest
[03:11:18] it's fun
[03:11:20] pog
[03:11:32] wait let me sing
[03:11:50] like what do you think you're cooking
[03:11:52] but it's not it trust me this is okay I
[03:11:55] do think he's fine and I really though
[03:11:56] like I actually think he's pretty fun
[03:11:57] though he's not like great but like I
[03:12:00] think it's fun that's what matters right
[03:12:01] I don't think he's fun like reverse
[03:12:03] mouth I think that's weird but I do
[03:12:04] think it's fun and then like this team
[03:12:06] are hyperloom especially it's like you
[03:12:07] know it is a hyper fridge it is what it
[03:12:09] is
[03:12:11] um
[03:12:17] but I don't know if that matters like I
[03:12:20] don't know if
[03:12:21] that's something that I need to
[03:12:23] emphasize trying to think what I'm gonna
[03:12:26] say
[03:12:45] to me Glennie broke it so that the Nerf
[03:12:47] her his brother I mean
[03:12:50] um for feminine man
[03:12:56] uh I am tired I'm at a crossword where I
[03:12:59] don't know if I want to end early or
[03:13:01] make a coffee I probably should end
[03:13:03] early though because I need to record
[03:13:05] uh I recorded most of it but I want to
[03:13:07] finish it
[03:13:12] um
[03:13:27] how do you dance the schedule it's not
[03:13:29] that bad I just barely slept last like I
[03:13:30] didn't get to sleep enough last night so
[03:13:32] I'm like kind of [ __ ]
[03:13:35] foreign
[03:13:37] oh yeah there's a new simulated Universe
[03:13:39] thing tomorrow I'll have to see if I can
[03:13:41] do that I'll let you guys know I might
[03:13:42] have to stream star rail
[03:13:46] I'll let you guys know Chad I'm down for
[03:13:48] that though if you guys are either
[03:13:49] tomorrow the day after
[03:13:51] isn't it today yeah but like 5 a.m right
[03:13:53] it's not out yet so later
[03:13:57] POG I'm down all right thanks for
[03:14:00] watching chat I love you guys I'm gonna
[03:14:01] end now and I'll try to stream again
[03:14:03] soon
[03:14:04] um I'll let you know if I do that
[03:14:06] it's not in Asia rcsc yeah it's not an
[03:14:08] idiot I don't know why I didn't make it
[03:14:10] Asian uh We're not gonna talk about that
[03:14:11] thanks for watching I love you guys
[03:14:12] sorry for the shortest stream I'm like
[03:14:14] dead as [ __ ] I I feel like I'm like
[03:14:16] yeah sorry for for being just dead but
[03:14:18] is what it is we're gonna read slice
[03:14:19] because he's cool
[03:14:21] um I'm gonna upload the the firmative
[03:14:24] guide is mostly recorded there's just a
[03:14:25] few things I want to uh modify uh what's
[03:14:28] up Rick for example I want to talk about
[03:14:30] uh I do think I do think okay I do think
[03:14:32] okay I think at first I didn't know
[03:14:36] if physical was only better for
[03:14:37] hyperloom but I feel like there's no
[03:14:39] reason not to run physical because
[03:14:40] usually the electric support is broken
[03:14:42] anyways and then you get free superco
[03:14:43] docs which makes it better so I actually
[03:14:45] think and you Auto attack more which
[03:14:47] makes Syncro more viable so I think just
[03:14:49] physical seems to be the wave
[03:14:51] um but I mean I guess both are fine
[03:14:53] I do think High problem is
[03:14:55] where he's fun though hyper fridge hope
[03:14:58] you drive the street thanks for all the
[03:14:59] new followers
[03:15:02] come on today's
