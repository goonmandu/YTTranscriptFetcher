[00:13:19] that's that's cool uh we have the word
[00:13:21] all the genal to do and then we will
[00:13:22] spam refresh this page until I either
[00:13:24] see arino see chind or see myself out of
[00:13:29] this [ __ ] live stream it's either one
[00:13:31] of those two or the stream's over uh
[00:13:33] then assuming we won we will continue
[00:13:36] Farm some some artifacts do this do that
[00:13:38] you know do what we want to do um maybe
[00:13:41] maybe review the banners we can do a
[00:13:43] banner review as well uh the yeah yeah
[00:13:46] those banners yeah um if it's
[00:13:50] sein if it's
[00:13:53] seedin if it's Siege
[00:13:57] ween if
[00:13:59] instead of refreshing the page at 6:
[00:14:01] a.m. and seeing AR Lino or clind or or
[00:14:04] or or someone else right someone of that
[00:14:07] stature I see Siege we I will set Siege
[00:14:13] on the
[00:14:14] nearest hilly TR
[00:14:17] encampment so let's pray that that's not
[00:14:19] the case and let's pray that we weren't
[00:14:25] baited speaking of hilly TR I did the
[00:14:27] event off stream cuz the week reset was
[00:14:29] actually pretty fun it it was like a bit
[00:14:31] too easy but like if they expanded on
[00:14:34] that that could have been cool but
[00:14:35] obviously they're never going to cuz
[00:14:36] they just release an event like that for
[00:14:37] like two days and then they take it away
[00:14:38] instead of giving us a game mode but you
[00:14:40] know it is what it is it's cool
[00:14:47] um it was dog [ __ ] stop coping dude it's
[00:14:51] a cool
[00:14:52] concept when when I see events I see
[00:14:55] could this be end game if they expanded
[00:14:57] on it it could dude that's that could
[00:14:59] have been a raid if that was just a bit
[00:15:01] harder it could have been
[00:15:06] cool
[00:15:08] anyways
[00:15:10] anyways uh what the [ __ ] is this laggy

[00:20:37] your [ __ ] day I wanted to start the
[00:20:38] stream off well but fine we'll talk
[00:20:40] about the banners so first of all who
[00:20:43] asked for this that's the wrong tweet
[00:20:44] I'm sorry uh let me let me actually find
[00:20:46] the banner oh don't leak the feed sorry
[00:20:50] I don't know what it could show there it
[00:20:51] is Happy ramadon chat let's look at this
[00:20:55] Banner so first of all there's chori
[00:20:58] nice stunning beautiful cool then two
[00:21:02] goo four stars and
[00:21:06] Dory now excluding the fact that when
[00:21:08] this Banner dropped I was on call with Z
[00:21:10] Jeff and he said I want Dory C6 cuz
[00:21:12] she's better than Soo I'm going to
[00:21:13] pretend I didn't hear that uh Dory is a
[00:21:16] a pretty um I would say invaluable to
[00:21:19] your account not because she's like oh
[00:21:21] wow you need her but because it's no
[00:21:23] value provided you own kie shinobu so uh
[00:21:26] I would skip uh that F1 fourstar trigger
[00:21:29] warning Dory uh Goro is is cool for the
[00:21:33] ETO right cool for ETO um we'll see how
[00:21:37] he interacts with shiori but defense is
[00:21:40] cool
[00:21:42] um no sskk you know let's just say it
[00:21:45] depends on how snapshot she is we'll
[00:21:47] have to see albo is so I don't see why
[00:21:49] she wouldn't
[00:21:51] be but you know yunin um y Yin is uh Yin
[00:21:59] you know cool for like y Mia um I don't
[00:22:01] know if she belongs on this Banner but
[00:22:02] you know it's it's overall a lowquality
[00:22:05] four-star Banner uh gor's nicer ETO
[00:22:07] yunen isn't really used in these teams
[00:22:08] at all she's good with Yia but like not
[00:22:11] these characters um Dory is not
[00:22:15] real and then we have the weapon Banner
[00:22:18] now no problem with Ali flash High based
[00:22:21] attack sword no problem with Ali Hunter
[00:22:25] it's a bow but then we have three one .0
[00:22:28] weapons the [ __ ] dragon's Bane I
[00:22:30] don't know whose dick Dragon Bane suck
[00:22:32] dry to be on every [ __ ] every [ __ ]
[00:22:36] weapon Banner since
[00:22:38] 1.0 I don't know it's been on every
[00:22:40] weapon Banner dude I see I see it I see
[00:22:43] it like eight times in a row but farzon
[00:22:45] can't get a banner outside of Scara she
[00:22:46] did recently with shenu and thank you
[00:22:48] for that but anyways um dragon's Bane
[00:22:51] makes me angry there's also the Bell
[00:22:53] which is more like the garbage and then
[00:22:56] favonius codex is cool it's also been on
[00:22:58] like a million banners um it's not the
[00:23:00] best Fab weapon because catus have other
[00:23:02] options and a lot of them don't really
[00:23:03] need the energy they could go throwing
[00:23:04] like Tails or an offense but it's nice
[00:23:07] um it's nice it's okay it's okay um and
[00:23:11] then for the five
[00:23:13] stars there's red horn and uraku
[00:23:18] misiri they're actually fine um the the
[00:23:21] the sword is really good for like um
[00:23:23] chori albo and the the Claymore is is
[00:23:26] red horn it's pretty good if you have
[00:23:27] like attack or or EO or
[00:23:32] whatever but the rest is not the four
[00:23:34] stars are kind of you know not nice and
[00:23:36] then these four stars are also not nice
[00:23:37] so I didn't want to talk about this and
[00:23:39] then also I don't know where people
[00:23:40] found this but apparently this [ __ ]
[00:23:42] Banner is infinitely worse than I
[00:23:44] thought apparently this Banner is
[00:23:46] infinitely worse than I thought
[00:23:48] apparently this Banner is infinitely
[00:23:49] worse than I thought because for some
[00:23:51] [ __ ] reason some [ __ ] decided
[00:23:54] to make it last like like one day and a
[00:23:56] half where is it
[00:24:00] I thought it would last like a while I
[00:24:02] was I thought it would actually last
[00:24:04] like a long time cuz it said like you
[00:24:06] know
[00:24:08] periodically where is it where is it
[00:24:11] where is it wait where does it say how
[00:24:13] long it lasts cuz I saw something it
[00:24:16] better it lasts Let me let me let me
[00:24:19] pause skip this alert I'm sorry thanks
[00:24:21] 18
[00:24:22] months this event wish last let me zoom
[00:24:25] in so you can read let me zoom in ha I'm
[00:24:27] breaking my [ __ ]
[00:24:28] [Applause]
[00:24:28] [Music]
[00:24:37] laptop this event wish lasts from after
[00:24:40] the version 4.5 update to
[00:24:43] 42 which is
[00:24:46] literally one week two week three
[00:24:50] [ __ ]
[00:24:52] weeks
[00:24:56] three
[00:25:00] three
[00:25:01] weeks I thought this was going to be
[00:25:03] like at minimum a full patch but
[00:25:05] probably longer like it's like another
[00:25:07] Banner oh cool
[00:25:11] now the worst part is now okay let's say
[00:25:14] it was like rotating every 3 weeks we
[00:25:15] had a bit different one right a bit
[00:25:17] whoever the newest like the oldest
[00:25:18] character is right that would be fine
[00:25:21] but what I don't like oh no no sorry
[00:25:23] that might happen but what I don't like
[00:25:25] is that the uh to my understanding
[00:25:28] in the like pity you get the like one
[00:25:31] out of two if you miss your 50/50 or one
[00:25:33] out of one right doesn't carry over
[00:25:35] which means if you pull on this with
[00:25:37] event wishes not standard wishes and
[00:25:39] lose your 50/50 and then that Banner
[00:25:42] goes away and the next one comes
[00:25:44] in I'm pretty sure you're still on 50/50
[00:25:49] right isn't that how it works I could be
[00:25:52] wrong cuz it's not out so if that's true
[00:25:56] and I assume it is
[00:25:58] that is
[00:25:59] [ __ ] so just like weapon yeah yeah
[00:26:03] yeah like the weapon thing yeah now well
[00:26:06] it's a bit different
[00:26:09] because yeah cuz the weapon thing is
[00:26:11] like you're guaranteed to on Banner
[00:26:13] weapon even if it's the wrong one of the
[00:26:14] two um which is still bad but at least
[00:26:17] the like pity carries over it just the
[00:26:19] the like Journey
[00:26:21] doesn't yeah fate Point that's why that
[00:26:23] that's what I was looking for um now
[00:26:27] okay to be Devil's Advocate oh my God yo
[00:26:30] yo dude this is a laptop I swear it's
[00:26:33] not on purpose I don't use this setup I
[00:26:35] don't use the setup I promise I don't
[00:26:36] use the setup I didn't mean to zoom
[00:26:38] there I'm just I want to zoom in in I
[00:26:40] want to zoom in general not there but
[00:26:42] look look look my mouse is on Jean I
[00:26:44] zoom it goes to Mona it's not my fault I
[00:26:46] promise anyways how to use their
[00:26:50] account maybe thanks for 1500 bity you
[00:26:53] can sh me D with the info
[00:26:56] listen now if you're someone who's like
[00:26:58] I want to main Ula I want to M albo CLE
[00:27:01] I've been waiting forever the one
[00:27:03] [ __ ] who's been asking for duuke
[00:27:04] for like seven years and still doesn't
[00:27:06] have him if that's you first of all rip
[00:27:08] Bozo second of all rip Bozo again but
[00:27:11] yeah Savor Primos you can get that
[00:27:12] character if you want them for most
[00:27:14] people this is a skip um I thought it
[00:27:16] would be like closer to a permanent
[00:27:18] Banner like a a seasonal like last for a
[00:27:20] while right all
[00:27:21] spring um if it just rotates to like
[00:27:25] whoever the newest like the oldest
[00:27:26] characters without a banner art that's
[00:27:28] fine but the Fate point is not cool and
[00:27:31] because it doesn't carry over so if you
[00:27:34] pull on it know that you should either
[00:27:36] pull you should either be okay with you
[00:27:39] should usually pull until you're
[00:27:40] guaranteed the character you want
[00:27:41] building pity or doing anything like
[00:27:43] that on this man is dumb as [ __ ] like
[00:27:44] you have to be at the point where if you
[00:27:46] get a five star you can keep going and
[00:27:47] get another five star so that you hit
[00:27:49] the Fate point before it it goes away or
[00:27:51] you're kind of wasting your
[00:27:54] Primos although in general the banner
[00:27:56] itself is kind of a waste unless unless
[00:27:57] you like really want
[00:28:02] something is it true that Amber kaai
[00:28:04] Lisa on the banner
[00:28:08] um it says all four star four
[00:28:15] stars
[00:28:17] yeah ew I mean okay okay yeah Kai Lisa
[00:28:21] bar whatever cool Amber wow ka's great I
[00:28:25] like Ka Lisa KH are actually not bad but
[00:28:29] these are like the oldest character I
[00:28:31] mean I
[00:28:38] guess
[00:28:40] okay let me be hype let me be hype and
[00:28:43] then I'll be on hype the hype part is
[00:28:44] yes Ka Lisa Woo right cool they're hard
[00:28:47] to get the not hype part is that there's
[00:28:49] only old four-star characters here right
[00:28:52] and like the new one is like ma but it's
[00:28:53] like Mona characters so maybe if you um
[00:28:58] didn't play the game for 3 years and
[00:29:00] then just started playing but have a
[00:29:02] like a thing for mon you're like hey I
[00:29:03] love monat like man I [ __ ] I wish I
[00:29:06] was a monst Adan if that's you you'll
[00:29:08] love this Banner but for everyone
[00:29:12] else
[00:29:15] like it's good for like fishal Bennett
[00:29:19] cons there's Noel there's diona sucros
[00:29:22] cons don't really matter like C1 is nice
[00:29:24] and C6 is cool if it works if it doesn't
[00:29:27] work you want to [ __ ] C6 yourself off
[00:29:29] a cliff Rosario is cool but she doesn't
[00:29:31] really need cons C2 is nice but that's
[00:29:33] it and then Ma so it's kind of like I
[00:29:36] would rather it just be every four-star
[00:29:38] character
[00:29:45] um it's not terrible I mean it's not
[00:29:48] terrible but it's worse than I
[00:29:55] thought oh the weapon there's all fa
[00:29:57] weapons
[00:29:59] though I mean okay there's all five five
[00:30:03] weapons which is good but there's also
[00:30:04] eye of perception the
[00:30:11] bell and wine and song which I've never
[00:30:14] seen anyone use ever it's not like that
[00:30:16] bad of a weapon I've just never seen
[00:30:17] anyone in my entire life equip wi and
[00:30:20] song
[00:30:21] willingly I've never seen someone like
[00:30:23] level it and use it that's just never
[00:30:25] happened it's not like the worst weapon
[00:30:28] I just it it does not see
[00:30:34] usage it's good for Shan Yun yeah if you
[00:30:37] don't have the other freeo playay
[00:30:42] options wine and song that's ER and like
[00:30:46] 44 base
[00:30:48] right yes that is ER and 44 base hitting
[00:30:52] an opponent with a normal attack
[00:30:54] decreases the stamina consumption yes
[00:30:57] and you get some attack
[00:30:59] wa for 5 seconds though which uh you
[00:31:04] know I think I I think this weapon was
[00:31:08] like what was I I think I I was thinking
[00:31:11] about it for like charge attack Barbara
[00:31:12] or some [ __ ] but the ER is useless for a
[00:31:14] lot of those
[00:31:22] characters Mona oh yeah maybe it was
[00:31:25] like I mean but
[00:31:31] no I don't know why I said charge attack
[00:31:33] Barbara cuz it's normals but I mean I
[00:31:34] guess you would normal and then charge
[00:31:36] maybe it was Mona it was definitely some
[00:31:37] Hydro
[00:31:39] character
[00:31:46] anyways but also with Mona it's like bro
[00:31:49] just use [ __ ] Fab anyways anyways uh
[00:31:53] yeah so that's
[00:31:56] cool
[00:31:57] that's cool when is Father coming
[00:32:04] back why does it say event exclusive or
[00:32:07] like event wish

[01:03:55] okay if you guys are like dude this is
[01:03:57] so weird why are you are you typing like
[01:03:59] like this just know that this exact
[01:04:01] message could be applicable to a few of
[01:04:02] the other characters as well um with
[01:04:05] that in mind Senora is definitely one of
[01:04:06] them for the record it's just that she's
[01:04:08] dead so I don't know like
[01:04:11] obviously we don't know if she'll like
[01:04:13] reincarnate if she does we don't know if
[01:04:15] she'll be like the same Senora or like a
[01:04:17] bird or if she's like like you know like
[01:04:19] a tombstone in which case that's kind of
[01:04:21] weird so I would in that case I wouldn't
[01:04:23] really want to pull for her but this
[01:04:24] will be like this okay let me title the
[01:04:26] tier let me title it okay let me title
[01:04:28] it out a row no above this is going to
[01:04:30] be the title

[01:04:44] release okay
[01:04:46] okay Senora is so basic though yes but

[01:04:55] generosity and Grace if possible being
[01:04:58] blessed by your presence over yeah I get

[01:05:04] Crimson Witch of
[01:05:06] flames especially this form I don't
[01:05:08] think this form is basic at all actually
[01:05:10] uh obviously like I know even this is
[01:05:12] cool though but like this form is
[01:05:13] [ __ ] sick but I don't think she'd be
[01:05:15] out this way you are the one desire
[01:05:19] believe when I say I Want It That Way
[01:05:23] true
[01:05:24] wait a second oh my [ __ ] God I might

[01:05:30] [ __ ] oh my God thank you twitch user

[01:05:41] scar Moosh Wanderer he's playable and
[01:05:45] Alive

[01:05:58] wasn't what if she were to come
[01:06:01] back and be playable and
[01:06:10] Alive she's a
[01:06:15] phoenix fate grants favors to no one
[01:06:19] only those who would fight it every
[01:06:21] ounce of their being may earn the to
[01:06:24] challenge it Pierro the
[01:06:28] jester oh yeah Ryan's also a weekly boss
[01:06:31] Ryden weekly boss alive yeah yeah
[01:06:37] yeah
[01:06:43] yeah coolia dude that's star rail I'm
[01:06:46] sorry keep dead she's a butterfly not a
[01:06:49] phoenix it's like a molten butterfly
[01:06:51] it's the same
[01:06:53] [ __ ]
[01:06:55] Hydro TPA that's not a weekly you
[01:06:57] [ __ ] that's not a
[01:07:16] weekly is this
[01:07:22] by
[01:07:52] for
[01:07:54] we can't
[01:08:02] read I mean this guy dude this guy looks
[01:08:04] like he'd be the most fun to play can I
[01:08:06] say that cuz he's the only character
[01:08:07] that's not designed to be
[01:08:09] like like [ __ ] like like I don't know
[01:08:13] like attractive so I feel like or like I
[01:08:16] don't know not I'm not but you know I
[01:08:18] feel like his kid has to be fun like I
[01:08:20] feel like he's goingon to if he's
[01:08:21] playable he's going to be fun as [ __ ]
[01:08:27] zag take is it maybe but dude like I I
[01:08:31] feel like he will be
[01:08:34] fun Uncle
[01:08:41] Z so this character is
[01:08:45] uh wait I always forget I always mix up
[01:08:48] sandron and Colina but I'm pretty sure
[01:08:50] Colina is this one uh I'm pretty sure
[01:08:53] with her
[01:08:54] for me personally it's going to be
[01:08:58] either very hype if she like controls a
[01:09:01] robot or summons a robot or anything
[01:09:03] where the kit revolves around the robot
[01:09:05] whereas if it's just like a normal ass
[01:09:08] character I'm going to be very
[01:09:08] disappointed so it's very 5050 for
[01:09:12] her
[01:09:15] um yeah I mean claraa is mostly sarog
[01:09:18] like you're playing claraa and it's
[01:09:19] [ __ ]
[01:09:22] sarog
[01:09:24] dude this tier list is so front
[01:09:34] loed that's sand
[01:09:38] drone
[01:09:42] sandrone yeah that's what is that what I
[01:09:51] said I don't know
[01:09:55] okay the only reason why it's not like
[01:09:57] this is because then what the [ __ ] is
[01:09:58] this tier list for at that point it
[01:10:00] would be like this and then why did I
[01:10:01] even make this why did I even make this
[01:10:03] if they're all in the same F maybe
[01:10:05] they're all dude [ __ ] all [ __ ] this [ __ ]
[01:10:07] you [ __ ] everything I'm excited for
[01:10:08] arino uh I'm excited for arino I mean
[01:10:11] okay if we're comparing them to other
[01:10:13] units it's literally like this like
[01:10:15] compared to like average character
[01:10:17] compareed to [ __ ] what's her name uh
[01:10:18] Siege weam okay they're all here but
[01:10:21] among their each other Among Us among
[01:10:23] each other it's probably like this she's
[01:10:26] on like the fence she's pretty similar
[01:10:30] yeah she's on the fence I don't
[01:10:31] know I like this guy but he reminds me
[01:10:34] too much of okay code sorry pent alone
[01:10:36] no nothing wrong with that I love code
[01:10:40] but clind any moment now oh yeah true
[01:10:43] what if there's two characters true what
[01:10:45] if there's what if
[01:10:47] there's someone said so you hate women
[01:10:50] first of all happy International women's
[01:10:52] day month happy International women
[01:10:53] women's months and second of all I just
[01:10:56] wrote this letter this entire letter to
[01:10:59] arlino so I don't know what you're
[01:11:06] saying that's father okay
[01:11:08] but it it is

[01:11:30] the The Chronic whatever Banner lasting
[01:11:32] like 2 seconds is
[01:11:34] stupid it should last like a SE it
[01:11:37] should be like a seasonal
[01:11:46] Banner why are people calling her
[01:11:49] father because uh she is called father
[01:11:53] first of all all look at her second of
[01:11:54] all uh in the quest if you do any story
[01:11:57] quest with ar Lino you would know that
[01:11:59] they all call her
[01:12:04] father Lura
[01:12:14] Skippers father is a
[01:12:17] title it's literally in the drip
[01:12:19] marketing okay I'm going to be honest I
[01:12:22] never read this entire [ __ ] yapping
[01:12:24] toon City but I will for you guys I will
[01:12:26] to this day let me move my camera to
[01:12:28] this day arlino still recalls that night
[01:12:30] when she was first appointed as a
[01:12:31] Harbinger up the stairs Down The Long
[01:12:34] Gallery oh I was there yeah I remember
[01:12:36] we were actually holding hands I I
[01:12:37] dropped her off I was like hey have fun
[01:12:40] at the uh Fatu at your little convention
[01:12:42] thing uh I'm too cool to be there they
[01:12:44] invited me Pio reached out he said yo do
[01:12:46] you want to join the you want to be
[01:12:47] number zero right do you want to be the
[01:12:49] number zero of the fatou I said hey I
[01:12:51] don't want to get in there there's be
[01:12:52] too many like L theories about me I'm
[01:12:55] good or like you know have a good day uh
[01:12:57] and then I went home but they're cool
[01:12:58] like you know I met all of them they
[01:12:59] were very nice to me um but anyways uh I
[01:13:03] digress to this day arino St calls at
[01:13:05] night up the stairs Down The Long
[01:13:07] Gallery with not to see through the
[01:13:10] window but a world of ice and snow
[01:13:11] Without End the biting wind wailed
[01:13:14] loudly now
[01:13:21] mirthful full of Mir okay Mar laughter
[01:13:25] now a somber farewell with a start arino
[01:13:28] came to the hallucinations of her memory
[01:13:31] mingling with the sounds of real life
[01:13:33] conversations that surrounded
[01:13:36] her wait is this comma super fluous let
[01:13:38] me let me read this with a start arino
[01:13:41] came to the hallucinations of her memory
[01:13:43] mingling with the sound of real life
[01:13:44] conversations that surrounded her I
[01:13:45] don't know if this is a needed comma but
[01:13:46] I'm not an English teacher anyways the
[01:13:48] Hearthfire burned with Vigor the its
[01:13:51] gentle warmth pervading the room
[01:13:54] it means she woke up
[01:13:57] oh oh like came to her like like oh I've
[01:14:01] seen this okay I know what you're saying
[01:14:03] I know what you're saying sorry I'm
[01:14:04] sorry she yeah yeah she came to herself
[01:14:07] true uh the internet has ruined my
[01:14:10] reading comprehension because of this
[01:14:11] verb uh this is what brain rot does to
[01:14:14] you with a start no the Hearthfire
[01:14:16] burned with Vigor its gentle warmth
[01:14:18] pervading the room and its red light
[01:14:20] glowed on the children's faces lighting
[01:14:21] up their innocent unaffected smiles
[01:14:23] if some uninformed passer by were to
[01:14:25] stumble in at this precite moment they
[01:14:27] would surely mistake the scene before
[01:14:28] them of that as an ordinary happy family
[01:14:31] but just as arino raised her steaming
[01:14:34] cup to take a sip of scalding hot black
[01:14:37] tea I have I made tea
[01:14:41] for the clock began to chime and with an
[01:14:44] instant the laughter and cheer that
[01:14:46] filled the room were banished the Flames
[01:14:49] flickered so that for a moment the light
[01:14:50] faltered the faces of all present cat in
[01:14:53] somber expression placing her cup back
[01:14:56] down arlino stood up and in a calm
[01:14:59] measured tone called out several
[01:15:02] names shapo you're with Lenny retrieve
[01:15:06] the required intelligence fols you and
[01:15:09] filiol are on guard Duty stay back and
[01:15:12] tend to the Hearth yes
[01:15:16] Father without a redundant syllable nor
[01:15:19] a hint of hesitation they answered as
[01:15:21] one not long after the fire had dwindled
[01:15:24] and the house Fallen utter silently
[01:15:26] utterly silent with nothing to be seen
[01:15:28] but a single shaft of infil a single
[01:15:32] shaft of infiltrating Moonlight peeking
[01:15:35] through a gap in the curtains upon a cup
[01:15:37] of gradually cooling
[01:15:52] tea

[01:23:15] Niche good with Yia do you know why this
[01:23:17] Banner is [ __ ] amazing because it's
[01:23:20] right before our Lino so we have this
[01:23:22] Banner then we have net K rerun and so
[01:23:25] this Banner used up a lot of the four
[01:23:26] stars that look let's face it are not as
[01:23:29] you know wanted no disrespect y yunin
[01:23:32] good with Yia Goro good witho
[01:23:35] Dory good with no one but you know if if
[01:23:39] we use up some of these four stars then
[01:23:41] maybe the AR Lino Banner can have
[01:23:45] like who do I even want on a banner
[01:23:47] unless I can craft my own Banner okay
[01:23:50] I'm biased it' be like [ __ ] Faron

[01:23:53] let's be real
[01:23:54] here we could get like
[01:23:59] a oh
[01:24:01] Chev honestly Chevy's a good take cuz
[01:24:04] she's pyro arer could have
[01:24:08] Chev one of the good older four stars
[01:24:11] just in case you don't have them like
[01:24:12] ficial s Bennett and then one newer one
[01:24:14] right that's good like Kirara not really
[01:24:16] Synergy with arino I know but she's good
[01:24:19] uh it could be someone that synergizes
[01:24:20] let's say either a vape melt or over
[01:24:22] overload support that could be who's a
[01:24:25] good character of those elements
[01:24:26] obviously SRO maybe I mean obviously
[01:24:28] like Rosaria but uh she's been on

[01:31:23] not too late after she's
[01:31:36] out let me launch genin is it time to
[01:31:40] play is there anything else they
[01:31:43] dropped imagine they give her out for
[01:31:45] free like do ratio because every player
[01:31:49] needs a
[01:31:50] father I'm going to beon honest Yaba
[01:31:53] Yaba no y yeah Yaba Yaba isn't that a
[01:31:56] song feel like my dad plays that in the
[01:31:58] car anyways I would be mad at them look
[01:32:02] I want the actually I want as many
[01:32:05] rewards as possible but do you really
[01:32:08] think they would give out probably the
[01:32:09] most hyped character I hope so if they
[01:32:12] do I will literally whip my [ __ ] out on
[01:32:14] stream I wouldn't do that that's weird
[01:32:17] but I'm just saying that would be great
[01:32:19] but I think you should ask like be like
[01:32:22] hey everyone needs um a strong Father
[01:32:25] Figure here's [ __ ] alham right that
[01:32:28] would be more realistic them giving uh
[01:32:31] uh fouille Harbinger AR Lino is a lot
[01:32:34] less uh

[01:40:02] right this isn't even bad this literally
[01:40:04] is good look it's actually good it's
[01:40:05] actually good this actually looks good
[01:40:07] lower render
[01:40:11] reso [ __ ] is
[01:40:17] that turn on 120 FPS mods
[01:40:23] find a
[01:40:24] tree a nearby
[01:40:27] tree and hire a lumberjack to cut it but
[01:40:31] not like don't make the tree fall over
[01:40:34] just make it sort of like lean from
[01:40:36] their neighbors's yard onto theirs and
[01:40:38] then all the leaves will fall into their
[01:40:40] lawn and then they'll have to clean it
[01:40:41] up if they happen to live in a colder
[01:40:43] country like Canada for example be sure
[01:40:46] to spend the entire winter shoveling
[01:40:48] your snow onto their driveway so that
[01:40:50] every time they want to go out they have
[01:40:52] to clear not just their snow but also
[01:40:56] yours also pee on their
[01:41:01] lawn I have 600
[01:41:12] resin psychopath what do you mean I
[01:41:14] didn't do anything that those were that
[01:41:15] was mods mods did that that's [ __ ]
[01:41:17] mods I can't believe you would do that I
[01:41:19] can't believe you would do that that's
[01:41:22] [ __ ] that's
[01:41:28] [ __ ] that's [ __ ] dude what if okay
[01:41:32] chat let can we Theory can we can we
[01:41:34] like can we like sus craft really fast
[01:41:36] okay like can we can we do this can we
[01:41:38] like okay can we can we like get a
[01:41:41] conclusion on what we think what we
[01:41:44] suspect right no leaks what we can guess
[01:41:48] AR Lino will want us to prearm okay so
[01:41:51] my
[01:41:52] guess is either Mar chose because
[01:41:56] everyone can use that with finina or if
[01:41:58] she can you know consume HP
[01:42:04] or something like I don't know maybe
[01:42:06] Crimson witch or now hear me
[01:42:11] out if she does lose HP or if finina
[01:42:14] makes her lose
[01:42:16] HP the Lost Valley now you guys might
[01:42:20] not have farmed the Lost Valley it's a
[01:42:21] pretty new set a pretty new domain but
[01:42:25] it is really good uh there's there's a
[01:42:27] set called Vermilion Hereafter and
[01:42:29] Echoes of an
[01:42:31] offering also chat I didn't see that it
[01:42:34] got updated but I checked my aasha
[01:42:36] ranking not that anyone cares our IO is
[01:42:40] two don't type Envy is one he's not no
[01:42:43] one no streamer is one we are the one IO
[01:42:46] but my build is a bit off and our sha is
[01:42:49] 13
[01:42:51] which is
[01:42:52] good just so you
[01:42:55] know two Ayo 13
[01:43:00] CH also if we look at my aoto even if I
[01:43:03] use this build if I get a single roll of
[01:43:06] attack crator crit damage we're number
[01:43:07] one one roll literally one
[01:43:09] roll uh and if we look at uh uh uh Jiao
[01:43:14] if we look at ja
[01:43:18] it's one crit rate roll puts us
[01:43:22] three so yeah
[01:43:32] lament not even
[01:43:36] one you guys want to know what the guy
[01:43:39] above me looks like I mean I'm better
[01:43:40] either way but we can we can look let's
[01:43:43] let's compare let's compare uh let's
[01:43:46] compare shs shall
[01:43:49] we
[01:43:53] let's compare shs so let me go
[01:43:55] leaderboard let me click on
[01:43:58] it okay first of all I'm noticing 93
[01:44:01] crit right here uh okay that's 88 never
[01:44:04] mind it's actually better with shenyun
[01:44:05] okay never mind uh this feather
[01:44:09] hasties are a for the Wellman if you'd
[01:44:13] like to learn
[01:44:15] theer this flower has an excess of
[01:44:17] attack percent so it does the feather
[01:44:19] now and the goet and the ciret now I
[01:44:22] would call this cringe for one reason
[01:44:24] not because I'm a crit value Andy but
[01:44:26] because Shan Yun doesn't give a [ __ ]
[01:44:28] about your Sha's attack necessarily
[01:44:30] because it will be sure her her her buff
[01:44:32] will be additive to your attack but
[01:44:35] multiplicative to your damage bonus so
[01:44:39] assuming Shan Yun is real and she
[01:44:42] is uh crit would be more impactful than
[01:44:46] attack
[01:44:47] per let's look at this one Shia hom
[01:44:53] that stand has 42 crit damage and ER and
[01:44:55] crit rate
[01:44:58] okay
[01:45:03] um
[01:45:19] okay
[01:45:22] wait what is this one 258 crit value but
[01:45:26] they have more attack yeah they do okay
[01:45:29] but dude dude this [ __ ] is just
[01:45:31] lucky dude luck dude dude how we're not
[01:45:35] going to talk about
[01:45:42] this anyways uh what we were talking
[01:45:44] about is what do we think our Lino is
[01:45:46] going to need uh I think it's either Mar
[01:45:50] shos or Vermilion the most likely one is
[01:45:52] mar Shi or Crimson witch but we're going
[01:45:54] to do a Vermillion run just to be safe I
[01:45:56] don't know how long I'm going to stream
[01:45:57] today but we'll do a bit of resin
[01:45:59] spending malice thank you for the tier
[01:46:02] one why did someone say deepwood why the
[01:46:05] [ __ ] would she need
[01:46:06] deepwood oh cuz she's in a buron team so
[01:46:11] we need to farm flower of Paradise Lost
[01:46:13] and if we need to farm flower for buron
[01:46:16] arlino then we can finally play hyper
[01:46:18] Bloom because we'll get a flower
[01:46:19] Paradise Lost em main stat set and you
[01:46:22] can't play hyper without that staring at
[01:46:24] her for 10 minutes and 5

[01:52:05] please don't hit em I have so many
[01:52:06] pieces that look like this and then hit
[01:52:07] em dude imagine honestly crit rate I'd
[01:52:11] be fine with crit rate or crit damage uh
[01:52:13] I think my flowers are more crit damage
[01:52:15] heavy so or more crit rate heavy so crit
[01:52:17] damage would be nice actually I there
[01:52:19] fine I I'll take
[01:52:21] I'll this is still good this is still
[01:52:27] good it's still good a lot of Y but

[01:52:48] 17.5
[01:52:53] honestly this one's lowkey better but
[01:52:54] it's em instead of attack so it depends
[01:52:56] depends on the character not bad not
[01:52:59] bad not bad I could use this on um stop

[01:53:14] she uses defense but we're going to wait
[01:53:16] uh but fishal
