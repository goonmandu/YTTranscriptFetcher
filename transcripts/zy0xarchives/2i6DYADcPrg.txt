[00:15:31] my one of my RL friends messag me like
[00:15:33] dude the comments on your last video are
[00:15:34] so funny and then I looked it's people
[00:15:35] be like ignore the random chess videos
[00:15:38] I've been watching but people have been
[00:15:39] people read like where is
[00:15:42] it uh someone wrote like oh this hearing
[00:15:47] his familyfriendly YouTube voice while
[00:15:49] also using face cam on the bottom corner
[00:15:51] is like watching net with wall Luigi
[00:15:53] voice dude what does that even
[00:15:57] mean
[00:15:59] anyways uh pretty funny comments but
[00:16:02] most people it was very supportive most
[00:16:03] people like this type of video and it
[00:16:04] was literally me rambling for an hour
[00:16:06] which is very motivating and means like
[00:16:07] oh [ __ ] I can make more videos like this
[00:16:08] if I need to cuz I always feel like I'm
[00:16:10] rushing to like finish my sentence uh
[00:16:13] but yeah so there you go that was a cool
[00:16:14] video uh also if you guys didn't see
[00:16:17] this tweet left my target audience but
[00:16:19] it's nothing bad I'm just saying
[00:16:21] apparently you get your battle pass
[00:16:23] rewards mailed to you in this game but
[00:16:24] not in genin did you guys know this [ __ ]
[00:16:26] can I open my mail on stream I think I
[00:16:28] can
[00:16:29] okay yeah
[00:16:31] um look
[00:16:33] look look what the
[00:16:37] [ __ ] who doesn't claim the battle pass
[00:16:39] yeah no one like obviously you're going
[00:16:40] to claim it if you're playing I get it
[00:16:42] but still why the [ __ ] dude they added
[00:16:45] this to starl but not the genin dude
[00:16:47] they actually hate getch players they
[00:16:49] actually hate getch
[00:16:53] players how you forget the claim I only
[00:16:55] forgot once and you might be like oh how
[00:16:57] do you forget just play haha you spent
[00:16:59] the money first of
[00:17:01] all oh I guess I did buy the St pass
[00:17:03] okay fair but second of all I claim it
[00:17:05] all at the end for a a good stream
[00:17:08] moment where I'm like guys we're going
[00:17:09] to click the claim button together and
[00:17:10] then it's nice and cathartic I just
[00:17:12] taught you a new word however I get that
[00:17:14] most people are just going to claim it
[00:17:16] but that's not my point my point is if
[00:17:17] they can add it to Quality of Life to
[00:17:18] this game why don't they add it to genin
[00:17:20] True also second of all uh a lot of
[00:17:23] times I'm undecisive as to who I'm going
[00:17:24] to build so I don't claim battle pass
[00:17:26] weapons or Trace mats like you know or
[00:17:27] Talent books engion because I don't know
[00:17:29] who the [ __ ] I'm going to build and who
[00:17:30] I'm going to invest into so I wait until
[00:17:31] the last second and then I decide
[00:17:33] because let's say you're like oh [ __ ] I
[00:17:35] want net but then you already claimed
[00:17:37] your battle pass weapon and now you
[00:17:38] don't have sacrificial Jade and you're
[00:17:39] too broke to you don't have Primo gems
[00:17:41] you can't pull for his [ __ ] weapon
[00:17:42] and you're going to go prototype Amber
[00:17:44] and hit your life prot Amber is not bad
[00:17:45] but you get my point anyways so yeah we
[00:17:48] got that
[00:17:53] um wow seriousness of
[00:17:57] breakfast why are you talking so
[00:18:00] fast why are you talking so

[00:18:15] more whatever fine I [ __ ] I play
[00:18:17] three destruction characters dude I've
[00:18:19] literally been doing I've been doing
[00:18:21] destruction every day for my life look

[00:19:09] really good though we can talk about it
[00:19:11] she does seem really good also I feel
[00:19:13] like this game kind of doesn't really
[00:19:14] give a [ __ ] it just keeps releasing
[00:19:16] better characters I could be wrong if
[00:19:17] I'm wrong prove me wrong but yeah uh now
[00:19:20] a lot of them have like Niche things
[00:19:21] where like you know blade when we get a

[00:23:29] have a good Jing Le you I like her
[00:23:32] I with that said it's probably like a 5
[00:23:34] to 10% DPS increase only so like I can
[00:23:37] probably just go sub stats I get it but
[00:23:41] like another
[00:23:46] thing ha you must have only installed

[00:24:28] Quantum yeah it's it's um good for
[00:24:31] Jing that's why it's not good for Ying
[00:24:34] but it's good for Jing
[00:24:37] the let me turn uh
[00:24:43] sounds wait what is it normal that
[00:24:48] three it's kind of
[00:24:51] loud Quantum is only good with signature
[00:24:53] and defense rad no it's only good with
[00:24:54] defense rad not sign signatures helps
[00:24:56] but you don't need it and if you're
[00:24:57] playing her without a [ __ ] defense
[00:24:58] Shredder what is wrong with you do you
[00:25:00] not have paa or silver wolf maybe

[00:25:20] know what I
[00:25:21] mean okay listen

[00:25:36] listen right before we pull chat can we
[00:25:38] make sure I have enough resources okay
[00:25:40] cuz I don't want to have to do this
[00:25:41] after we pull we have 68 jelled chiten
[00:25:44] ch ch Chen sit siten Mage Cen I don't
[00:25:48] know that we have 177 blue a green 159
[00:25:52] blue 26 purple obviously oh k w but like
[00:25:55] we can convert them it'll be fine then I
[00:25:57] don't have L Mas but we have a Lon
[00:25:59] leveled so it's
[00:26:00] fine then we have okay I might need more
[00:26:04] of these cuz we have no purples but it's
[00:26:07] okay uh because worst case I can
[00:26:10] transmutation Full Metal Alchemist
[00:26:12] should be fine uh I have a lot of
[00:26:15] credits 4
[00:26:18] million running out of those I know but
[00:26:21] dude the I swear the last character I
[00:26:22] leveled doesn't Dan Hong need these I
[00:26:23] swear I just farmed them like I swear I
[00:26:25] farm them for someone else doesn't Dan
[00:26:27] hung need these

[00:26:31] it's not showing me but I swear he does
[00:26:32] whatever so yeah
[00:26:35] anyways so I think we're ready uh keep
[00:26:38] in mind oh another big thing another big
[00:26:40] thing I really wanted to make a dring
[00:26:42] you guide but I kind of got [ __ ] from
[00:26:44] external sources so what I did instead
[00:26:46] is I recorded three things I recorded a
[00:26:48] short two things sorry a short form like
[00:26:51] how to build her in 60 seconds which I'm
[00:26:52] going to upload and we're going to make
[00:26:54] an actual video
[00:26:56] but
[00:26:58] it'll be a second Channel video because
[00:26:59] I don't want to upload like a 30 minute
[00:27:01] thing and I don't want to half ass one
[00:27:03] like I don't want to rush one that I
[00:27:04] think isn't complete so we're going
[00:27:05] upload a second channel one which we're
[00:27:07] going to talk about on stream today but
[00:27:09] before we get there and before I
[00:27:10] showcase her and before I can fully
[00:27:12] build her we need to spend a little
[00:27:17] bit a little bit of time trying to get
[00:27:20] an ice ball and rud in Arena so we're
[00:27:22] going to speedrun that and if I can't I
[00:27:24] will deep throw my microphone that's a
[00:27:25] promise so hopefully we get an ice ball
[00:27:28] once I do we can we'll be done and we
[00:27:30] can use
[00:27:32] her
[00:27:34] anyways we have to do that today so a
[00:27:36] bit of a longer stream but we're going
[00:27:37] to we're going to speedrun it okay with
[00:27:38] that said let's pull for her maybe like
[00:27:41] but I don't think so no problem I don't
[00:27:42] think we're going to but maybe like I
[00:27:43] want it but I don't think I don't have
[00:27:44] the mats like I do have the mats but I
[00:27:46] don't shut up [ __ ] you I don't want to

[00:51:51] that Jing Jing Yuen has to kill her and
[00:51:53] yaning has to kill Jing Yuen but I don't
[00:51:55] know the rest of the
[00:52:06] lore anyways let me gear her or
[00:52:12] keep what are yeah minor ches crit
[00:52:15] damage and speed and AG
[00:52:19] pness I'm going to have to reread all
[00:52:21] their things but
[00:52:24] yeah
[00:52:27] this was pretty POG POG
[00:52:31] tent pretty sure Trace par skill Talent
[00:52:35] alt so we're going to do
[00:52:53] that stop stop I'm leveling how is this
[00:53:00] stalling let me craft more purples but
[00:53:02] before I do do I need any blues for
[00:53:04] anything I might for these right the
[00:53:05] minor traces wait no these are purple
[00:53:07] what about this one yeah these ones are
[00:53:08] blue
[00:53:15] yeah normal attacks don't [ __ ] matter
[00:53:19] right I mean I guess I could get a level
[00:53:21] two
[00:53:24] but
[00:53:25] shouldn't
[00:53:29] matter uh do I want plus three speed I
[00:53:31] mean I guess okay let me craft all the
[00:53:34] [ __ ] I need cuz I have a lot of blue
[00:53:35] mats I just don't have any purples do I
[00:53:36] need any blues to see if I should keep
[00:53:38] any doesn't look like
[00:53:40] it doesn't look like
[00:53:43] it you're going for a Quantum yes I
[00:53:46] think so I think that's the plan I I
[00:53:48] like dude I'm I talked about this
[00:53:50] earlier I literally pre- farmed relics
[00:53:52] for like 17 years and I I still am like
[00:53:54] it's still work in progress which upsets
[00:53:56] me but it is what it
[00:53:57] is uh I thought this was a [ __ ]
[00:53:59] Electro sigil from Ena Zuma okay uh
[00:54:02] we're going to wait what was I going to
[00:54:03] do what was I going to do oh yeah I have
[00:54:05] to craft these
[00:54:07] things what's the quickest way to get to
[00:54:09] the [ __ ] crafting I'll just click on
[00:54:10] them I guess where is
[00:54:11] it uh wait no that doesn't work I have
[00:54:14] to do
[00:54:18] this I should want to synthesize okay
[00:54:20] let's
[00:54:22] do it's in the menu I know but [ __ ] you
[00:54:25] I thought is there no hotkey for
[00:54:27] synthesize cuz I pressed B for backpack
[00:54:29] what the [ __ ] is synthesize can I press
[00:54:30] s to prepare for Sleep z0 X
[00:54:44] shy no s is walk backwards okay dude if
[00:54:48] you're okay [ __ ] you uh dude obvious
[00:54:51] okay shut
[00:54:53] up [ __ ] up shut up shut up I don't even
[00:54:55] want to talk to you right now I don't
[00:54:57] even want to talk to
[00:54:58] you why someone type exclamation mark
[00:55:01] Hello fresh that was like 10 streams ago
[00:55:03] that was literally like last
[00:55:08] year this is why do they always make me
[00:55:12] level like HP or defense to get to the
[00:55:15] good [ __ ] at least she like drains your
[00:55:17] max HP so like I guess more HP is cool
[00:55:20] but like [ __ ] Coke
[00:55:24] Zero
[00:55:26] okay this I'm at least getting
[00:55:28] nine not her HP yeah it's teammates but
[00:55:31] yeah you're right actually whatever dude
[00:55:33] I'm coping can I maybe maybe what if I'm
[00:55:35] going to be weak what if I'm vulnerable
[00:55:37] what if like they they target my Jing so
[00:55:39] I need the max HP so I don't die true
[00:55:41] true low W true low W true low
[00:55:44] W do I want this speed maybe how much
[00:55:47] speed do I have i y had like 140 on her
[00:55:49] build so I should have more than enough
[00:55:50] speed I actually don't know if I can
[00:55:51] make
[00:55:52] my yeah no we should be fine we should
[00:55:54] be fine
[00:56:10] just play on double speed this is double
[00:56:12] speed sorry I me we might as well we
[00:56:15] have enough let's just do
[00:56:20] this wait do I not have enough wait how
[00:56:23] many do I have five I need like eight
[00:56:24] let's just [ __ ] transmutation [ __ ]
[00:56:31] it all right plus four speed okay listen
[00:56:35] listen we're going to gear her and we're
[00:56:36] going to talk about how to gear her I'm
[00:56:38] not going to make a video on it that's
[00:56:39] going to be sick
[00:56:41] however
[00:56:43] however listen between me gearing her
[00:56:46] and me doing like a clear memory Cal 10
[00:56:49] swarm five we're going to do both of
[00:56:50] those today before we do that please
[00:56:54] understand she just lamented by the way
[00:56:55] please understand that we need to farm a
[00:56:58] little bit because I swear when I say
[00:57:01] this and you can kind of see it but I
[00:57:03] threw away a lot of them I synthesized
[00:57:06] like 50 bodies and I still don't have a
[00:57:08] good one and I force crafted two Rudin
[00:57:10] Arena Ice spheres and I farmed it in my
[00:57:13] own time and I still don't have a good
[00:57:14] one so I like I swear it's a work in
[00:57:17] progress it will get better but for now
[00:57:20] it is what it is okay so we're going to
[00:57:21] do that today we're going to spam uh
[00:57:23] World 7 we're going to speed on it and
[00:57:25] then we're going to talk about how to
[00:57:26] build her but for now here's what I have
[00:57:29] okay I also Auto Battle Genius of
[00:57:31] brilliant Stars a lot um and I kind of
[00:57:34] got [ __ ] my my head my headpiece sucks
[00:57:36] I like my twopiece twopiece is better if
[00:57:39] I go two piece twopiece it's technically
[00:57:40] better but I think if you use two P2
[00:57:42] bece you're a coward that's not true
[00:57:44] that's actually not true it's actually
[00:57:45] it's fine but we're not going to use two
[00:57:46] P to be cuz yeah but my four piece is
[00:57:48] fine um it's fine I have I have good I
[00:57:51] have good boots my boots are
[00:57:53] good
[00:57:56] my boots are
[00:57:58] good my gloves are decent obviously
[00:58:01] having some Critter would be cool but my
[00:58:02] gloves are
[00:58:05] decent my head kind of sucks but at
[00:58:08] least there's
[00:58:10] speed uh we I like as I said I I got a
[00:58:13] bunch I leveled I leveled a bunch to
[00:58:14] three or four and then they they rolled
[00:58:15] bad and I threw them and
[00:58:20] then my body sucks massive balls
[00:58:27] uh now I could use a crit rate one but
[00:58:29] my crit rate one also sucks and she also
[00:58:31] starts with 50 crit rate
[00:58:36] um so yeah this is the piece that I've
[00:58:39] been farming the most it's just I've
[00:58:40] gotten [ __ ] on it like a million times
[00:58:42] so I'm going to plus 15 this on stream
[00:58:44] bro thinks that's cely I mean it's yes
[00:58:47] you built her like cely except speed
[00:58:49] boots instead of
[00:58:50] attack usually attack's fine too but I
[00:58:53] think attack boots are cringe
[00:58:57] why Quantum we'll talk about it later
[00:58:58] but basically it's just good cuz she
[00:59:00] gets a lot of other
[00:59:05] stats dude I literally I'm telling you I
[00:59:08] spammed this world this isn't even all
[00:59:10] of them by the way I synthesized a bunch
[00:59:11] of bad ones I I swear and I force
[00:59:14] synthesized two ice ones I force
[00:59:17] synthesized two ice ones I still suck
[00:59:20] balls so I think we're going to do iner
[00:59:22] Sal Soo I know iner sucks okay you're
[00:59:24] not supposed to use a nerd on her I know
[00:59:26] I know I know I know but for now we have
[00:59:30] to okay we have to okay it's like if
[00:59:34] your car breaks down and you bike to
[00:59:37] work it's like yeah a car would be more
[00:59:39] efficient but sometimes you know a bike
[00:59:41] is fine it's fine well I do I need more
[00:59:44] CR rate we got plus 50 plus 50 right so
[00:59:46] this is f wait we're kind of pogging oh
[00:59:49] we have not enough speed no we have more
[00:59:50] than 134 wait we're actually poging wait
[00:59:51] we're actually poging wait we're
[00:59:53] actually pogging wait we're actually
[00:59:54] poging we're actually pogging we're
[00:59:56] actually poging we're actually
[01:00:03] pogging do I have a clickbait weapon
[01:00:06] plus 18 crit rate no I'm not doing that
[01:00:08] okay we're pretty good
[01:00:11] um 30 crit rate listen here punk sorry
[01:00:15] that was toxic uh I could I'm going to
[01:00:18] this gives you 50 see 47 48 then we can
[01:00:21] get it to 10 wow 50 crit rate for free
[01:00:29] poggers I kind of want to get up to nine
[01:00:31] though cuz then I
[01:00:33] can [ __ ] [ __ ] I thought I had enough
[01:00:38] wait how many I have two 2+ three is
[01:00:39] five plus maybe another six I need like
[01:00:42] eight or nine wait only eight that's
[01:00:44] doable only eight that's doable only
[01:00:46] eight that's doable only eight chat no P
[01:00:48] W's this is a free to-play accessible
[01:00:49] shop no pw's no pw's no pw's you're not
[01:00:53] allowed to PW you're not you're you're
[01:00:54] not you're just not you're just not
[01:00:55] you're just not you're just not you're
[01:00:56] not you're not you're not no PW it's
[01:00:58] literally free to play accessible
[01:01:12] true yeah it's 50 at level 10 that's
[01:01:14] what I thought I was like I swear it's
[01:01:15] 50 but yeah that's why okay uh we'll get
[01:01:18] it to 10 eventually but assuming we gain
[01:01:20] 50 crit rate that's 80 whoa 80 crit rate
[01:01:26] uh now obviously we should be on rolent
[01:01:28] Arena but that's a work in progress I
[01:01:31] chose a weird streamer to get my drops
[01:01:33] dude dude surely you view me as more
[01:01:35] than drops surely we have like a
[01:01:37] parasocial connection that has formed
[01:01:39] surely I'm not just the drop machine
[01:01:41] surely you don't just call me Mr
[01:01:43] drops I'm sorry I'm sorry I know I know
[01:01:46] my place I'm sorry I'm sorry you're not
[01:01:49] even human okay well that is awkward
[01:01:53] okay let's go go do a quick Auto Battle
[01:01:55] Run of uh something just to just to test
[01:01:57] her out you know because I need a good
[01:02:00] uh another quantum piece so might as
[01:02:01] well do that then we'll talk about how
[01:02:03] to build her and what we're going to do
[01:02:05] agree agree agre
[01:02:14] agre actually before we do that let me
[01:02:16] reread all of her talents cuz it's been
[01:02:18] a while and I want to make sure I don't
[01:02:19] make a mistake so there's that there's
[01:02:22] that and there's that
[01:02:24] and then her alt is damage that you
[01:02:27] usually use inside of your state and
[01:02:29] then your skill is what you spam which
[01:02:33] is good damage and then it consumes a
[01:02:35] stack well you actually gain Stacks from
[01:02:36] the [ __ ] this thing or from uh where
[01:02:40] is it where the [ __ ] is the
[01:02:45] thing
[01:02:50] wait I have to reread
[01:02:53] everything uh uh yeah you eat your
[01:02:56] friend's HP you gain
[01:03:04] attack
[01:03:07] okay I saying yeah you basically want
[01:03:11] sisy sacks and you enter a steak stake
[01:03:13] you enter a stake where you get 50 crit
[01:03:15] rate level 10 and like a [ __ ] ton of
[01:03:17] attack like 2K or some
[01:03:19] [ __ ] and then you eat your friend's HP
[01:03:22] for that to increase your attack by the
[01:03:23] HP cons Ed like the total amount capping
[01:03:26] at a high amount like around 2K is uh
[01:03:29] and
[01:03:34] then you basically just Spam your skill
[01:03:36] but I'm trying to figure out and you alt
[01:03:38] when you're inside of your state for
[01:03:39] more damage there and also for more
[01:03:41] damage because you get like
[01:03:44] buffed
[01:03:51] um
[01:03:53] yeah
[01:03:55] okay then you usually do two normal
[01:03:56] skills and then you get your Advanced
[01:03:58] your action Advance forward and then you
[01:03:59] do enhanced skill and you're in like the
[01:04:01] siy mode and then you alt in it and
[01:04:03] you're chilling okay also I don't know
[01:04:06] if my PE is geared so excuse any
[01:04:10] accidental
[01:04:13] moments nothing
[01:04:18] major all right the first time I use
[01:04:20] this how does it look like well that's
[01:04:21] the basic one so no one cares um uh fine
[01:04:25] go again
[01:04:29] streng why do you have Quantum that cuz
[01:04:31] she's a Quantum unit she's Seely listen

[01:05:30] counter check ratio and an enhanced
[01:05:32] State sure so we should get it now right
[01:05:35] this and our yeah actions Advance
[01:05:37] forward and then we're buffed and now we
[01:05:38] can
[01:05:42] ult Okay let's
[01:05:48] listen I don't know why I skilled first
[01:05:50] but
[01:05:50] whatever all will be revealed

[01:06:44] them receive
[01:06:48] Divinity check your ratio isn't it just
[01:06:50] plus [ __ ] 50 crit rate what's so
[01:06:52] special we'll check I guess the attack
[01:06:53] too fine we'll
[01:06:58] check yeah so 80 it should be 80 if I
[01:07:01] had it level 10 it's not level 10 now
[01:07:03] and it should be even more attack so
[01:07:05] basically 50 crit rate and 2K attack
[01:07:08] is not quite that but yeah also I don't
[01:07:11] know if we consume the max HP from our
[01:07:13] friends or not but
[01:07:19] yeah this is double speed sorry all will
[01:07:22] be revealed
[01:07:24] in lunar
[01:07:30] flame whoa what the [ __ ] why is this on
[01:07:33] guard
[01:07:35] of okay we didn't get anything we wanted

[01:08:23] you that's how they get you that's how
[01:08:24] they get you but join the Dark Side it's
[01:08:27] fun over
[01:08:31] here okay we're going to do okay before
[01:08:33] we okay before okay okay here's the plan
[01:08:36] I'm going to explain the plan for today
[01:08:37] chat I'm going to explain the plan what
[01:08:38] the [ __ ] am I
[01:08:42] doing 118 Reserve dude it's not even
[01:08:44] that bad I'm sorry I'm touching grass uh
[01:08:48] saving lives okay I'm sorry it's not
[01:08:51] even
[01:08:52] bad
[01:08:58] wow ZX is so tall cool and handsome
[01:09:04] true okay here's what we're going to do
[01:09:06] we are going to spam World 7 now I
[01:09:10] genuinely I swear I farm this off stream
[01:09:12] a lot I really tried to get a good ice
[01:09:14] one I couldn't okay I couldn't so we're
[01:09:18] going to speed run this right now then
[01:09:20] we're going to demonstrate her in silian
[01:09:21] Universe 5 and sorry in swarm 5 but that
[01:09:24] doesn't matter as much and memory of
[01:09:25] chaos 10 which matters more okay cool
[01:09:31] now I should probably talk about it now
[01:09:34] but she's not fully built so I don't
[01:09:37] know if I want to talk about it when
[01:09:38] she's not fully built I think what I'm
[01:09:39] going to do is pretend she's fully built
[01:09:42] when I talk about it put Rudin Arena on
[01:09:44] and then we talk about it even if my
[01:09:46] Rudin Arena pieces are absolute garbage
[01:09:49] um so we're going to just put Rudin
[01:09:51] Arena on and pretend that they're good
[01:09:53] good okay pretend that they're
[01:09:55] good we're going to talk about it okay
[01:10:00] so do I have pons I can
[01:10:03] activate poggers should I activate it I
[01:10:06] mean this doesn't matter dude it
[01:10:07] literally doesn't matter she literally
[01:10:10] yeah she just [ __ ] reduces defense it
[01:10:12] doesn't [ __ ] matter whatever I mean
[01:10:14] sure doesn't do
[01:10:18] anything o wrong
[01:10:22] lone
[01:10:29] sorry I'm a Lua
[01:10:31] addict
[01:10:34] okay okay we're going to talk about how
[01:10:35] to building Li okay now okay ignore my
[01:10:38] stats
[01:10:40] right I can't cuz if this gets clipped
[01:10:42] the stats look dog [ __ ] it's I promise
[01:10:45] she's better okay I'm going
[01:10:52] to
[01:10:54] I can't I can't it looks too bad I
[01:10:55] actually can't I actually can't I can't
[01:10:57] I can't it actually looks too bad I
[01:10:58] can't I actually can't where's the good
[01:10:59] piece I want this one
[01:11:01] okay okay wait what the [ __ ] where did
[01:11:04] my crit rate
[01:11:06] go oh I'm on the wrong
[01:11:09] ball M I love
[01:11:12] balls ice cream so tasty
[01:11:15] okay okay so now let's talk about how to
[01:11:19] building because you guys keep asking
[01:11:21] and let's make this nice and simple and
[01:11:23] clear
[01:11:24] so she just came out but actually a
[01:11:26] pretty Nuance character to build okay
[01:11:28] here's my understanding of it and how
[01:11:29] you should be building her so first of
[01:11:31] all talk about her lyes her signature L
[01:11:33] cone which I can show you
[01:11:35] guys is absolutely insane okay it's her
[01:11:38] best L cone by a pretty big margin not
[01:11:40] like the biggest but pretty big like I
[01:11:42] think 15 to 20ish per but I could be
[01:11:46] wrong stay tuned for math but yeah it's
[01:11:48] a pretty decent margin uh it gives you
[01:11:51] crit damage and it just gives you a [ __ ]
[01:11:53] ton of stats as always you ignore
[01:11:54] defense which has some Synergy with
[01:11:56] other stuff we're going to talk about
[01:11:57] and more damage on top of the crit
[01:11:59] damage so uh yeah so it's just a lot
[01:12:01] also higher base stats obviously uh
[01:12:03] which you know matters but yeah so it's
[01:12:05] just really good um but I'm not going to
[01:12:10] Super emphasize it because while it is
[01:12:12] good and you can get it if you want let
[01:12:14] me mute alerts I'm sorry just cuz um
[01:12:16] this might be clipped so yeah but I
[01:12:17] appreciate it thanks for the sub uh but
[01:12:20] I'm not going to emphasize it too much
[01:12:21] because while it is good and her best SL
[01:12:23] and you can consider pulling for it you
[01:12:25] can also use on the fall of an Aon which
[01:12:26] is a free tolay lone and you can
[01:12:28] superose it to S5 for free as well now I
[01:12:31] can't superose it for five right now
[01:12:32] because I had to buy some other ly cones
[01:12:34] like I have uh cruising and the Stellar
[01:12:36] sea and stuff but you can get it from
[01:12:37] Hera shop and it's actually really good
[01:12:39] okay it's her second best option
[01:12:40] generally if you have it S5 there's
[01:12:42] other options that are really close
[01:12:43] though but generally her second best it
[01:12:45] gives you some attack some damage uh and
[01:12:47] the effect is pretty like pretty easy to
[01:12:49] proc right pretty good pretty good uh
[01:12:51] stat stick it's a easy five star likeone
[01:12:52] so those are like the two ones and I
[01:12:53] could end that there and you're cool you
[01:12:55] either have a signature or a free playay
[01:12:56] one but there's some other good ones too
[01:12:58] especially with super musician like
[01:13:00] Arland a secret vow which can give you
[01:13:02] up to 40% uh damage from the just flat
[01:13:05] out well 40 or like doubled if it's S5
[01:13:08] uh obviously let me show this I don't
[01:13:10] know how to show this easily but
[01:13:11] whatever it's it's here right okay well
[01:13:15] I'm hyperventilating how do I show it
[01:13:16] whatever it doesn't matter anyways it
[01:13:18] gives you a lot of
[01:13:19] damage um what am I doing sorry sorry
[01:13:22] calm down calm down calm down Z anyways
[01:13:24] yeah so Arland is really good uh also uh
[01:13:28] under the yeah that one under the blue
[01:13:29] sky is also pretty decent and uh the
[01:13:32] most welcome you is fine it's a bit
[01:13:33] worse but under the most welcome you is
[01:13:35] also not bad so these three are also
[01:13:36] fine or any of the five stars like Clara
[01:13:39] even Blazer Dan hungs are okay as well
[01:13:42] um but typically you either have her
[01:13:43] signature or you get the next best thing
[01:13:45] which is a freeo playay option at S5 uh
[01:13:47] which is on the fall of anon the other
[01:13:49] lyones like especially Arland are really
[01:13:50] good too though so yeah that's lyone
[01:13:54] uh before we talk about traces relics
[01:13:56] listen ignore this ignore this please
[01:13:58] give me a second please give me a second
[01:13:59] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm still in the I'm
[01:14:00] still in the process give me a second
[01:14:02] give me a second give me a second cut
[01:14:04] this out of whatever the Clipper just
[01:14:05] stop okay Relic pretend take two relics
[01:14:10] wow rudant Arena and uh a four piece set
[01:14:13] why the [ __ ] are you on a Quantum set ZX
[01:14:15] why are you on a Quantum set why is one
[01:14:17] person in your chat right now spamming
[01:14:20] with every single message is I said bad
[01:14:22] is I said bad is iset calm down please
[01:14:25] please life is a lot better if you take
[01:14:27] a deep breath okay I said is not bad in
[01:14:30] fact IET is the most generalistic option
[01:14:32] obviously ice character I set easy
[01:14:34] simple you didn't need a 50-minute video
[01:14:35] to tell you that okay it's fine it's
[01:14:37] still the general just go to I don't
[01:14:39] want to think I don't want to think
[01:14:40] about my team set okay gives you 10%
[01:14:42] damage and 25% crit damage it's just
[01:14:45] good well you might not be able to alter
[01:14:47] for two turns but anyways it's good
[01:14:51] there's ways to go around that though
[01:14:52] but yeah anyway news it's good
[01:14:55] but the quantum set can be either about
[01:14:58] as good or better under a few
[01:15:00] circumstances which I'm going to explain
[01:15:01] now because people are going to be
[01:15:02] asking this a bunch and uh yeah I feel
[01:15:06] bad about not releasing a full guide so
[01:15:07] here's like a small one Okay the reason
[01:15:09] why Quantum can be good is because who
[01:15:10] gives a [ __ ] about the quantum damage
[01:15:11] percent right 10% Quantum damage useless
[01:15:13] cool but then you deal more damage by
[01:15:17] ignoring enemy defenses you either
[01:15:18] ignore 10% or 20% you well there's other
[01:15:22] factors here too like you're going to
[01:15:23] reduce defense but yeah ignore 10%
[01:15:26] defense just flat out against any enemy
[01:15:28] and then you ignore another 10% if they
[01:15:30] have Quantum weakness so two things here
[01:15:32] first of all a large amount of enemies
[01:15:34] in the game already have Quantum
[01:15:36] weakness and you can also technically
[01:15:38] implant it with silver R but that's not
[01:15:39] even needed even without the quantum
[01:15:41] weakness just the 10% defense can make
[01:15:45] it about as good as the I set and then
[01:15:47] if they have Quantum weakness it'll be
[01:15:48] better and there's other factors and
[01:15:50] this is only true by the way if you're
[01:15:51] running a defense reducing support which
[01:15:53] you probably are going to you might not
[01:15:55] and if you're not who cares go iset and
[01:15:58] then have fun with your life but you're
[01:16:00] Pro her best teams Jing's best teams are
[01:16:02] usually Harmony support like BR nil
[01:16:06] support P or silver wolf and then a
[01:16:07] Healer or shielder okay if you do that
[01:16:11] and you have a defense reducing support
[01:16:12] reducing defense with peer silver wolf
[01:16:14] means that ignoring defense becomes even
[01:16:16] more valuable which means that a set
[01:16:19] like genius can actually be your best in
[01:16:21] slot okay not by a huge margin but on
[01:16:24] average it'll be the best it also gets
[01:16:27] better with your signature lyone and it
[01:16:29] also gets better um the more defense
[01:16:31] reduction you have and if the enemy has
[01:16:33] Quantum weakness which either just a
[01:16:35] large percent like I forget the
[01:16:36] percentage like 30 40 something like
[01:16:38] that just of enemies in the game have
[01:16:39] Quantum weakness or you can implant it
[01:16:41] with silver wolf like by accident uh or
[01:16:43] if they already have like ice or you
[01:16:45] could just even if that's not true it'll
[01:16:47] still be on par and sometimes even
[01:16:49] better um with the I set now this is
[01:16:53] obviously day one in early math so like
[01:16:55] this could be subject to change maybe
[01:16:57] I'm a [ __ ] idiot but for now it does
[01:17:01] seem like this is true and that Quantum
[01:17:03] is on average usually a little bit
[01:17:05] better if you're running a defense R
[01:17:07] reducing support sometimes quite a bit
[01:17:09] better sometimes a bit worse but pretty
[01:17:12] similar so you can go based on sub stats
[01:17:14] and on average it'll be a bit better if
[01:17:15] you're running a defense or using
[01:17:16] support and then even better if you have
[01:17:18] herone um and even better if the enemies
[01:17:21] have like Quantum weakness but that's
[01:17:23] obviously like when I say on average
[01:17:25] it's on average of enemies that have it
[01:17:27] and don't have it so do you should you
[01:17:30] absolutely go the
[01:17:31] set it depends do you already have a
[01:17:33] good ice set I
[01:17:36] don't um also you can go twopiece
[01:17:38] twopiece twopiece twopiece is not that
[01:17:40] far behind uh for example like a
[01:17:42] twopiece of any of these things that
[01:17:44] give you like speed or attack or
[01:17:45] whatever and twopiece of the ice set are
[01:17:48] actually fine options as well and if you
[01:17:50] have better sub stats then you can go
[01:17:51] that as well um or you can go for genius
[01:17:53] of brilliant stars or you can go for uh
[01:17:55] Hunter of glacial Forest okay the two
[01:17:58] four pieces are what I usually recommend
[01:18:00] but two pieces is fine too that's it the
[01:18:02] and make sure you have a defense
[01:18:03] reducing support like pill or silver
[01:18:05] wolf if you're running this if not it's
[01:18:06] you shouldn't so that is the conclusion
[01:18:09] of the first part of the set now I know
[01:18:11] it's weird to run a Quantum set but it
[01:18:13] actually works okay again early math but
[01:18:16] yeah it actually does work so for your
[01:18:20] um the stats you're looking for
[01:18:23] typically you want a crit damage body
[01:18:25] because she gains basically a free 50
[01:18:27] crit rate okay in her enhanced state
[01:18:29] which you basically always want to be in
[01:18:31] you want to rush that out ASAP sorry
[01:18:34] afap AAP uh you get 50 crit rate at
[01:18:38] level 10 and a bunch of attack that's
[01:18:39] like basically like 2000ish it's just a
[01:18:41] lot it's just a ton of attack based on
[01:18:43] how much HP from your allies you consume
[01:18:44] so a ton of attack and a ton of crit
[01:18:46] rate because of that you want more crit
[01:18:48] damage you still want crit rate right
[01:18:49] you still need crit rate but not as much
[01:18:52] cuz you start at 50 right like you gain
[01:18:54] 50 for free to whatever your existing
[01:18:55] amount
[01:18:56] is um and you also have a 5% base in
[01:18:59] this game too right it's not genin it
[01:19:00] should be 55 but anyways yeah so you
[01:19:03] just get that for free and you have a
[01:19:05] ton of attack and because you also have
[01:19:06] a ton of attack you can hit diminishing
[01:19:08] returns on that stuff which doesn't mean
[01:19:10] attack is bad but it means that crit
[01:19:11] becomes even nicer right you have a lot
[01:19:13] of attack you have a lot of crit rate
[01:19:15] crit damage becomes a lot nicer some
[01:19:16] additional crit rate to hit like 70 80
[01:19:19] maybe 90% all becomes better at least 70
[01:19:21] for R Lita and and uh speed is really
[01:19:24] nice too so that just cuz it's good on
[01:19:26] like basically every carry uh there's
[01:19:29] you can play usually I recommend at
[01:19:30] least 134 for two turns in the first
[01:19:32] cycle of memory chaos um and I would
[01:19:35] recommend I we often play her with braia
[01:19:38] and then BR speed could be fast or slow
[01:19:40] there's like a ton of BR optimization
[01:19:41] stuff but the most simple way is run BR
[01:19:44] on one less speed so that you can uh
[01:19:47] jinglu and then BR I've seen some builds
[01:19:49] of like super fast braia where you like
[01:19:50] basic attack and stuff but that's just
[01:19:52] just the general way to do it and then
[01:19:54] for your other to be set you want rlin
[01:19:56] Arena now listen I don't have a good Rin
[01:19:58] I've been farming this for so long I
[01:19:59] still don't have I literally Force
[01:20:01] crafted like module resin two ice
[01:20:03] spheres it still sucks so there's
[01:20:06] Alternatives uh R arena is the best do
[01:20:08] it and try to get 70 crit rate at least
[01:20:10] which should be pretty
[01:20:11] easy uh but if you don't have it then
[01:20:14] that's okay you can go space stealing
[01:20:16] station as the second best option or
[01:20:18] just whatever and then just go based on
[01:20:20] sub stats for me right now I am using
[01:20:22] inerd salotto not because it's great but
[01:20:25] because I just farmed I I just have good
[01:20:27] inerd pieces so that is what I'm running
[01:20:29] um and then on your main stats you
[01:20:31] obviously want I can't find it you
[01:20:33] obviously want um ice on your sphere
[01:20:36] this is super super important because
[01:20:37] remember while attack is technically
[01:20:39] viable you gain a ton of attack when
[01:20:41] you're in your enhanced State because
[01:20:42] you gain a ton of attack more attack
[01:20:44] would hit diminishing return so you want
[01:20:45] more damage so ice sphere really really
[01:20:47] good and then for your rope uh attack is
[01:20:50] the best uh ER R is is like cool but it
[01:20:54] attacks just better um yeah from my
[01:20:58] understanding of it at least there might
[01:20:58] be some rotations where you're like you
[01:21:00] want like your alt faster and then you
[01:21:02] could err there's always some weird
[01:21:03] things with that but for a carry attack
[01:21:06] is usually better especially for her cuz
[01:21:07] her skill is like a lot of damage so
[01:21:10] yeah so yeah that's why I'm on Quantum
[01:21:12] and uh I want rolent Arena but for now
[01:21:16] we're
[01:21:20] subsiding someone asked I thought the
[01:21:22] defense down debuff like PE and silver
[01:21:24] wolf uh when you have that the ignore
[01:21:26] defense is redundant because of
[01:21:28] diminishing returns okay no in fact now
[01:21:30] I'm not like the biggest math major but
[01:21:32] for my understanding the more defense
[01:21:35] reduction you have the more efficient
[01:21:36] ignoring defense is like cuz they're
[01:21:39] kind of like together and it's like the
[01:21:40] more yeah I from my understanding it's
[01:21:42] the opposite so if you reduce defense of
[01:21:44] enemies and you ignore defense the more
[01:21:46] you get the more defense you're ignoring
[01:21:48] the more defense you're reducing right
[01:21:50] the better more of it becomes
[01:21:53] like ignoring 90% defense is a lot
[01:21:55] better than ignoring [ __ ] 10
[01:21:59] right it's a different multiplier there
[01:22:02] you go but yeah basically you want
[01:22:04] defense reduction for this ignoring
[01:22:06] defense to be even better than if you
[01:22:08] didn't have
[01:22:08] it so that's how you build that um for
[01:22:11] traces Trace priority is skill and
[01:22:14] talent are pretty similar but skill
[01:22:16] should be the best one and then talent
[01:22:17] and then alt and you can usually ignore
[01:22:19] the basic attacks cuz who cares you're
[01:22:20] just spamming your skill and unlock all
[01:22:22] of your like minor traces and stuff it's
[01:22:23] pretty
[01:22:25] important idolon worth uh I'm going to
[01:22:28] be honest I only read her E1 I'm sorry
[01:22:31] I'm sorry I usually read them all for
[01:22:32] like a full guide but I only read the E1
[01:22:34] E1 looks pretty good
[01:22:41] um wait this is my wrong coffee why do I
[01:22:43] have two coffees on my
[01:22:46] desk E1 is nice because you get so free
[01:22:49] 24 crit
[01:22:50] damage and then you also if if you clear
[01:22:54] like the ads like you're fighting a boss
[01:22:56] and you kill the other ones or there's
[01:22:57] like two bosses and you kill one uh and
[01:22:58] a lot of late memory of chaos floors is
[01:23:00] like one big enemy if you clear like the
[01:23:02] ads and you're hitting that one big
[01:23:03] enemy then
[01:23:07] um you just do more damage 100% like
[01:23:10] just additional damage so it's yeah
[01:23:12] really good E1 is really good um her
[01:23:15] signature is also really good though so
[01:23:18] I personally think signature might be
[01:23:21] more appealing
[01:23:24] but I could be wrong on that well it's
[01:23:27] 24 and then yeah I think I think
[01:23:29] signature looks more appealing if I was
[01:23:31] only to pull S1 or E1 I would probably
[01:23:32] go S1 yeah yeah yeah signature is huge
[01:23:35] yeah yeah I would go signature but e1's
[01:23:37] nice
[01:23:38] too so yeah that is like the tldr how to
[01:23:41] builder in case you're wondering um also
[01:23:43] I want to say we're going to Showcase
[01:23:45] this build in action we're going to go
[01:23:46] do memory C 10 uh but I'm going to I
[01:23:48] want to try to farm R in Arena first
[01:23:50] okay I want to I want to see if I can
[01:23:51] get it but uh with that said my ratio is
[01:23:53] really good I have a lot of attack you
[01:23:53] gain more attack in your state I have a
[01:23:55] lot of crit rate you gain more well plus
[01:23:56] 50 so that'll be 80 crit rate and a
[01:23:58] bunch of crit damage I'm going to try to
[01:24:00] get R Arena also
[01:24:05] um I kind of got [ __ ] by some stuff
[01:24:09] out of my control so I can't make a full
[01:24:11] guide for her right now which is why I'm
[01:24:13] going to make a shorter form one which
[01:24:14] will be upload my second Channel and a
[01:24:16] short on the main channel so in case
[01:24:17] you're wondering but yeah I'm pretty
[01:24:20] sure from like everything that genius
[01:24:22] and Ice are just pretty close like
[01:24:24] genius is definitely better though if
[01:24:25] you're running a defense Shredder and
[01:24:26] especially with a signature and
[01:24:29] um just on average but it doesn't really
[01:24:34] matter like I'm not going to be like oh
[01:24:36] my God you're building her wrong like
[01:24:37] it's fine ice is fine and if people say
[01:24:39] ice isn't fine they're dumb but like
[01:24:41] it's like a little bit
[01:24:43] better go farm I'm giving you my good
[01:24:45] RNG okay we're going to farm now and
[01:24:47] then we'll test her out in memory like
[01:24:48] showing the build will be Memory chos 10
[01:24:51] for now we're just going to try to get a
[01:24:52] good good R how many times have
[01:25:07] this more importantly no one has ice and
[01:25:10] everyone has Quantum yeah I mean like
[01:25:11] exactly it depends on like who you
[01:25:13] farmed for
[01:25:15] right I know it's hard to remember the
[01:25:18] people we used to be sorry I'm sorry I'm
[01:25:21] sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry one sec
[01:25:23] I'm trying to reset something really
[01:25:25] fast I guess we can start uh we'll play
[01:25:27] Jing br oh I didn't talk about our teams
[01:25:29] oh my God oh my God oh my God I forgot
[01:25:31] oh my God I
[01:25:41] forgot wait I forgot to team okay tldr
[01:25:44] tldr tldr tldr tldr TDR BR is your god
[01:25:48] jinglu and BR should never be separated
[01:25:49] they hold hands actually never mind
[01:25:50] that's Steely but don't separate them
[01:25:52] they're really good if you have BR if
[01:25:53] you don't have BR what are you doing get
[01:25:54] BR I'm not going to shame you for being
[01:25:56] free to play if you don't have her
[01:25:56] that's okay you can also use tingyun or
[01:25:59] ASA or another Harmony
[01:26:02] um I want to say you can use yukong but
[01:26:04] if you use her you have to like speed
[01:26:06] tune and like know what you're doing and
[01:26:07] she gets better with eidolons and it's
[01:26:09] just like not consistent but it can be
[01:26:11] if you speed tune and you know what
[01:26:12] you're doing so you can but generally I
[01:26:14] would recommend uh BR as the best option
[01:26:16] if not tingyun is honestly fine energy
[01:26:19] attack damage genuinely fine uh okay too
[01:26:23] and Bron is just the best there though
[01:26:25] and then that's going to be your Harmony
[01:26:26] support then you want usually a nihility
[01:26:27] one it's usually Harmony nihility and
[01:26:29] then like a Healer or shielder the
[01:26:30] nihility is really good defense
[01:26:32] reduction which is huge when you have a
[01:26:34] ton of attack and then you're building
[01:26:35] crit and then you reduce their defense
[01:26:37] it's just amazing way more damage uh so
[01:26:39] I highly recommend Pila as a great
[01:26:41] fourar option that can reduce the
[01:26:43] defense of every enemy without even
[01:26:44] needing skill points uh or silver wolf
[01:26:48] who would be better in single Target
[01:26:49] worse in AOE but can also implant ice or
[01:26:52] Quantum which can actually matter with
[01:26:54] the quantum set reduce defense pretty
[01:26:56] easily and uh time for a bug sorry so
[01:26:59] yeah that's usually your like core and
[01:27:01] then you go a Healer or a shielder uh
[01:27:04] Lua
[01:27:06] great um E4 P better though wait what is
[01:27:08] E4 again I know E1 gives energy what is
[01:27:10] E4 I forget oh yeah yeah you can do that
[01:27:14] too wait I actually forgot about that oh
[01:27:15] my God yeah you also reduce ice res why
[01:27:17] did I forget about that that's another
[01:27:18] Point ding ding ding you also could have
[01:27:20] this and you can kind of remove a debuff
[01:27:22] from an enemy with your skill so
[01:27:24] yeah for your last slot healer so luo
[01:27:27] Works uh lyx is a really good fre on the
[01:27:29] fourstar option uh fre play options
[01:27:31] Natasha is fine Bou is usually like a
[01:27:35] bit worse because there's no cleans but
[01:27:36] you're already going to run BR so
[01:27:38] sometimes you one cleanse is fine by can
[01:27:40] be okay uh but otherwise you could also
[01:27:42] use a shielder like fan or japar who I
[01:27:44] don't have um
[01:27:46] or oh yeah that's like the standard team
[01:27:49] usually it's Harmony nil and then healer
[01:27:51] or shielder that's like standard healer
[01:27:54] is pretty nice too because you're like
[01:27:55] consuming some of your allies HP because
[01:27:57] of jinglu uh and the way she works with
[01:28:00] that said there's like variations like I
[01:28:02] know people are going to be like oh can
[01:28:03] you mono cryo with silver wolf probably
[01:28:06] like you could well yeah I guess with
[01:28:07] jard probably um I don't have him so I
[01:28:10] can't test it or you could I've seen
[01:28:13] some double double carry theorizing
[01:28:16] going around where you would run her
[01:28:18] like a Healer or whatever and then a
[01:28:19] support that would buff you or debuff
[01:28:21] enemies and then like blade which
[01:28:25] works um I am probably going to try that
[01:28:28] today cuz I haven't had time to test
[01:28:29] that but I've it should work cuz she
[01:28:32] also like blade doesn't use a lot of
[01:28:34] skill points and then jinglu will use
[01:28:35] the skill point like per every time it's
[01:28:37] her turn but Pila doesn't and then your
[01:28:40] healer kind of doesn't kind of sometimes
[01:28:42] has to heal especially if it's a skill
[01:28:43] point efficient healer like Lua so it
[01:28:46] should work and we'll try it but yeah
[01:28:48] her standard team though is like one
[01:28:49] like this and Bron is your best support
[01:28:56] yeah she also has Synergy with blade in
[01:28:57] case you're wondering um because
[01:29:00] of wait a second I'm gonna find it I'm
[01:29:02] gonna find it I'm gonna find it oh yeah
[01:29:04] she eats his HP that's why she eats
[01:29:06] blad's HP she's like and then blad's
[01:29:08] like the pain sorry this is supposed to
[01:29:10] be an informational uh clip but yeah she
[01:29:13] eats some of his HP which triggers um a
[01:29:16] lot of synergy with his kit like notably
[01:29:18] making his full-up attack proc faster
[01:29:21] yeah yeah you stack it when you take H
[01:29:24] uh when you take damage or consume HP so
[01:29:30] yeah he looks at you look at
[01:29:35] him so there you
[01:29:38] go you still leveled up all his traces
[01:29:41] listen here punk
[01:29:46] sorry okay now we're going to test our
[01:29:50] memory cast 10 but before then we'll see
[01:29:51] if we can get a good Arena set agree
[01:29:52] agree agree agree agree agree agree
[01:29:56] agree where's
[01:30:04] pail uh one second
[01:30:07] chat should we do hunt what should we do
[01:30:09] with her what do you guys want to see
[01:30:11] why don't you have agre dude agre looks
[01:30:13] stupid we can add a GRE
[01:30:20] fine
[01:30:24] okay I added a GRE no wait I
[01:30:31] didn't
[01:30:34] um one sec sorry chat I have to get to a
[01:30:37] new shooting star
[01:30:39] what okay we're good I added a wait I
[01:30:44] added
[01:30:45] it refresh my
[01:30:47] chat get her likeone before you go
[01:30:50] in if we get a good ice sphere and okay
[01:30:55] if we get a good Rudin two Beast I'll
[01:30:56] pull for her weapon lone but I don't
[01:30:58] even have enough mats though I think we
[01:31:00] just do remembrance is good but
[01:31:02] remembrance is like it's just like you
[01:31:04] like I mean I guess we could
[01:31:11] remembrance I want to speedrun though we
[01:31:13] have to go through this fast cuz this
[01:31:14] isn't where we're trying to Showcase her
[01:31:15] we just want to go through this fast
[01:31:17] okay we remers [ __ ]
[01:31:19] it holy [ __ ] it looks so dumb yeah it is

[01:31:50] though if it's bad dude but I it's it's
[01:31:53] an
[01:31:55] unlock surely we can manage it if we can
[01:31:57] manage it it's good surely we manage it
[01:31:59] surely we manage
[01:32:01] it wait I forgot to read what her

[01:40:55] counter salotto is good on her no uh
[01:40:58] it's it's worse than the other options
[01:41:00] cuz it's ultimate and follow-up attack
[01:41:04] and for her like yeah her alt is pretty
[01:41:06] good but most of her damage comes from
[01:41:07] her
[01:41:08] skill well a lot of it at least her
[01:41:11] all's still good don't get me
[01:41:15] wrong but
[01:41:19] yeah
[01:41:21] I mean I guess it's worth mentioning as

[01:42:18] like so I feel like not having the
[01:42:33] healing receive Divinity like I feel
[01:42:35] like not having the healing would be
[01:42:36] annoying Comming

[01:43:04] Enemy you'll pay for
[01:43:08] this L me your
[01:43:10] strength sh cons 4% most enemies are
[01:43:13] dead before it gets
[01:43:14] dangerous we've entered the
[01:43:16] storm to guard and defend crush them
[01:43:28] a fair point all will be revealed in
[01:43:31] lunar
[01:43:33] flame why does she look at me like
[01:43:37] that attack or speed boots in a YouTube
[01:43:40] video I would say it depends but I'm
[01:43:41] streaming so I'm going to say speed cuz
[01:43:44] attack is
[01:43:49] cringe
[01:43:55] you have optimal rotation suggestions
[01:43:57] without bronia yeah pull for bronia the
[01:43:59] optimal rotation is entering your credit
[01:44:00] card oh who that wait wait wait wait
[01:44:04] wait wait wait wait we can use this on
[01:44:07] on on blade on blade we use this on
[01:44:08] blade wait wait wait let me cook let me
[01:44:12] cook let me cook we can use this on
[01:44:16] blade it has HP too it has HP dude I
[01:44:19] want ice but it's fine it's fine we can
[01:44:21] use this on blade wait wait let me cook
[01:44:24] a little just just please let me in the
[01:44:25] kitchen for like 2 minutes [ __ ] you
[01:44:28] unrelatable we didn't even roll it yet
[01:44:30] why are you mad at me
[01:44:48] no why did we take that
[01:44:53] [ __ ] [ __ ] dude why did we take
[01:45:00] that she's moving look at
[01:45:07] her wait you can walk I for you can
[01:45:18] walk okay uh we might as well roll
[01:45:28] okay I'm going to add this by the
[01:45:29] way also I did forget to mention you
[01:45:33] could technically use Nery soda on her
[01:45:36] because 8 crit rate and uh ultimate
[01:45:38] damage which is not bad but the other
[01:45:40] sets are better like R and Arena
[01:45:44] so Quantum set resident sleeper you're
[01:45:47] resident sleeper oh no resident sleeper
[01:45:49] it's a better set that's more efficient
[01:45:51] well it's not really more efficient
[01:45:52] depends on who you
[01:45:56] play could be more efficient wind set's
[01:45:58] not bad
[01:46:08] so only good with one team no it's good
[01:46:10] with basically any team that's not
[01:46:12] actively griefing what are you going to
[01:46:13] do not play paila or if you're playing a
[01:46:15] normal team with one carry you're
[01:46:17] playing paila if you're playing two
[01:46:18] carries with blade you're playing paila
[01:46:20] when are you not playing a defense
[01:46:22] reducing support what team can you make
[01:46:23] with her without it mono ice you're
[01:46:25] playing silver wolf literally literally
[01:46:28] think of a team that uses her you're
[01:46:29] probably reducing
[01:46:32] defense maybe not like if you're for fun
[01:46:34] I still recommend ice as the general
[01:46:36] option I'm not saying only use yeah mon
[01:46:38] I can use both actually I'm not saying
[01:46:40] only use the Quanto set I never said
[01:46:41] that but it's not like only for one team
[01:46:45] it's for all of her good
[01:46:49] teams
[01:46:58] okay we're going to level
[01:47:01] this and also another thing if I don't
[01:47:04] talk about Quantum set then what's the
[01:47:05] point of anyone ever making a guide ever
[01:47:07] cuz if if okay let's say let's say oh
[01:47:09] using Quantum set on non- Quantum
[01:47:11] character is cringe right let's say
[01:47:12] that's true okay then what would be the
[01:47:14] point of ever making a guide if you
[01:47:15] could just be like oh ice character
[01:47:17] let's use the ice set just do that use
[01:47:20] the set go offensive stats it's not that
[01:47:21] hard you don't need someone to [ __ ]
[01:47:22] explain it to you but learning why the
[01:47:24] quantum set can be good on her and when
[01:47:26] is a bit more
[01:47:27] advanced okay we're going to we're going
[01:47:29] to level this ball we're going to level
[01:47:31] this ball we're going to level this ball
[01:47:34] we're going to level this ball this is a
[01:47:36] I already have a really good one but
[01:47:36] this is on inert so a good rulin would
[01:47:39] be pretty
[01:47:40] POG Electro than for two
[01:47:43] years Quebec streamer equal equally
[01:47:46] easily stun locked by one guy Omega
[01:47:49] l you know what I would ban you but
[01:47:52] that's true so [ __ ] you dud I don't get
[01:47:55] stun locked okay I don't get stunlocked
[01:47:59] there's a difference between answering a
[01:48:02] question and getting Sun locked we're
[01:48:04] going to plus five it just to get one
[01:48:05] roll at start ready chat we have this is
[01:48:08] for blade which means crit damage
[01:48:10] amazing crit rate amazing HP percent
[01:48:13] also good okay and it's four C is at
[01:48:16] level zero it's just a juicy ball I'm
[01:48:18] going to screenshot it
[01:48:20] it's a juicy
[01:48:26] ball first roll that hey let me cook
[01:48:32] that that hey that's a good roll that's
[01:48:34] a good roll blade

[01:48:39] as good as CRI but it's fine HP still
[01:48:40] good HP still good that's
[01:48:44] fine that's fine just keep dodging
[01:48:47] defense for happy I don't even want to
[01:48:48] say the word I said the word I ruined
[01:48:49] the lock let me me back out and go back
[01:48:51] in to reset it anything HP crit rate
[01:48:55] crit damage we're
[01:48:56] happy all three stats are amazing please
[01:48:59] please please please HP is fine crit
[01:49:03] rate amazing crit damage I would
[01:49:05] literally not I didn't say that crit

[01:49:28] yo and we rolled HP
[01:49:32] once that's like an HP roll too that's
[01:49:34] not like only one that's two that's base
[01:49:36] plus another one and a crit R damage
[01:49:41] she okay well and I'm a blade main I
[01:49:45] decided I wasn't sure if I made inor or
[01:49:47] blade for a while but then I noticed
[01:49:48] that off stream I only played blade so I
[01:49:49] like I guess guess I main blade so there
[01:49:51] you
[01:49:53] go wow holy [ __ ]
[01:49:57] [ __ ] holy [ __ ] [ __ ] what am I going
[01:50:00] to do with this ball now wait but the
[01:50:01] new one's better right it's just better
[01:50:03] yeah it's literally bigger better
[01:50:04] stronger faster we lose out on four
[01:50:06] speed which is [ __ ] cuz wait I don't
[01:50:08] run speed on my blade oh okay never mind
[01:50:11] I don't care zero speed whatever uh I
[01:50:15] need I need a HP rope now
[01:50:22] they have an HP rope I might have throw
[01:50:24] them away well not like the good I
[01:50:26] didn't get a good one if I I would only
[01:50:27] throw bad ones but oh this one has crit
[01:50:29] damage this one has crit damage this one
[01:50:31] has crit
[01:50:40] damage [ __ ]
[01:50:46] it do you level her basic attack who
[01:50:48] Jing no
[01:50:55] jinglu is not benched if anything we're
[01:50:56] going to play blade with her okay put
[01:50:59] them
[01:51:00] together oh attack per is kind of
[01:51:03] useless for blade
[01:51:06] but push me to the edge oh
[01:51:18] my
[01:51:28] this just all odd
[01:51:31] whatever I mean
[01:51:38] uh one
[01:51:40] more luck ran out honestly I'm not even
[01:51:43] complaining we got a good sphere I don't
[01:51:45] a good ball I do not care it's fine we
[01:51:47] got a good ball I don't care yeah it's
[01:51:49] fine it's fine
[01:51:56] this is our best one for now obviously
[01:51:57] it sucks
[01:51:59] balls but it's our best one whatever
[01:52:03] it's going to roll CR damage here watch
[01:52:04] guaranteed are money back guaranteed
[01:52:07] or okay
[01:52:10] well is this a better or worse ratio
[01:52:12] than
[01:52:15] before 77
[01:52:18] 182
[01:52:23] what do we have
[01:52:29] before what was our inert rope it had 16
[01:52:32] so it had another so we okay we would
[01:52:33] have had five more crit damage six more
[01:52:37] H 5.8 let's say six more and then our
[01:52:40] ball would have given
[01:52:48] us oh no this is better
[01:52:51] we're better now we're actually better
[01:52:53] okay this is
[01:52:56] better just use the compare button okay
[01:52:58] nobody uses the compare button nobody
[01:53:01] uses the compare button what's up
[01:53:06] Cloud we have 10 one
[01:53:10] speed wait that means our BR wait okay
[01:53:14] we used to okay so ARR uh she needs a
[01:53:17] bit more she needs like 1 three4 but AR
[01:53:19] BR used to run
[01:53:22] [ __ ] AR bronia used to run 104 with
[01:53:26] blade now we're going to have to run
[01:53:31] 100
[01:53:41] whatever or like 180 yeah I mean I'll
[01:53:45] see you

[02:10:46] come oh
[02:10:53] listen here scarer it's actually uh uh
[02:10:56] so it could be net or net it's hard to
[02:10:59] tell because it's a French word and
[02:11:01] there's no French voice acting
[02:11:03] however obviously when it's l in French
[02:11:05] it's e so you wouldn't pronounce the L's
[02:11:07] but uh because it's like it's like in
[02:11:12] the word v you pronounce l so you can
[02:11:15] assume that in English it would be or in
[02:11:16] French it would be
[02:11:19] because it's V but it's hard to
[02:11:21] [Music]
[02:11:25] tell the name of the town of France the
[02:11:27] hell is pronounced so there you go yeah
[02:11:29] but France isn't real

[02:12:55] 10 right it can't be that big of a deal
[02:12:58] right
[02:13:11] surely why not strong
[02:13:14] boss before I started stream on top of
[02:13:16] me farming it I spent literally I I've
[02:13:20] crafted at least 40 [ __ ] I spit
[02:13:22] everywhere at least 40 [ __ ] relics

[02:21:03] running show
[02:21:11] yourage the Dead return the storm
[02:21:14] regular so regular we're going to do
[02:21:15] storm after though
[02:21:18] wait how I'm going to stay awake if I'm
[02:21:20] going to do I don't know I'll figure it
[02:21:22] out we're just farming really
[02:21:29] fast dude I saw someone I saw someone
[02:21:33] when I posted about
[02:21:35] like how genin is not loved and we don't
[02:21:38] get Battle pass rewards I saw someone be
[02:21:40] like clearly you didn't claim your
[02:21:42] battle pass rewards to get interactions
[02:21:45] and this is bait and honest honestly I
[02:21:48] wish that was true I'm I actually would
[02:21:50] rather us all just act as if that's true
[02:21:52] and that I didn't forget the claim
[02:21:54] because I'm not an idiot why would you
[02:21:55] [ __ ] forget the claim on a game you
[02:21:57] play every [ __ ] day so obviously I I
[02:21:59] wouldn't forget and it was just bait and
[02:22:01] I was interaction farming truly surely
[02:22:03] that's that's what it
[02:22:06] was enemy
[02:22:09] situation the
[02:22:16] moonay
[02:22:17] oh wait I get the stack even if I don't
[02:22:19] attack on
[02:22:21] her I mean I guess that's obvious but I
[02:22:23] never tried it
[02:22:26] before the Dead
[02:22:29] return we're speed
[02:22:33] running Stand
[02:22:38] Down
[02:22:40] of wait Chad what's better okay usually
[02:22:43] I would alt and then skill here right
[02:22:44] but I kind of want to BR buff my ALT so
[02:22:46] should I I just skill and then bronia
[02:22:49] then I lose energy am I
[02:22:51] coping me your strength I think this is
[02:22:53] better though no all will be revealed
[02:22:56] we'll see in lunar
[02:23:03] flame that's the only skill check in
[02:23:05] Star rail like there's some rotation
[02:23:07] stuff that's hard but I swear the only
[02:23:08] [ __ ] skill check is when you have
[02:23:10] full energy and it's like your next
[02:23:12] character is going to buff you and then
[02:23:13] you have to decide if you use your skill
[02:23:14] and get no energy or if you use your alt
[02:23:16] and get no Buffs
[02:23:21] and you failed it [ __ ]
[02:23:27] you what the [ __ ] is this lose all
[02:23:30] Cosmic fragments for every 100 fragments
[02:23:32] lost increase crit
[02:23:34] damage I mean sure it's an unlock and
[02:23:37] that's pretty good that's 48 crit damage
[02:23:38] sure easy
[02:23:41] unlock what's up
[02:23:43] Zer
[02:23:46] uh

[03:13:00] Auto Battle this and I'm
[03:13:02] fine this guy's ice resistant okay
[03:13:04] that's why it's it's not her fault okay
[03:13:06] cuz she this guy is uh tanks ice damage
[03:13:09] so you don't want to use ice her so we
[03:13:11] are going to use the character that I
[03:13:12] normally use uh uh uh when I'm just like
[03:13:14] running through it okay so that's what

[03:41:22] it how's it I beat swarm world five on
[03:41:26] my first try in the Train on my phone
[03:41:29] half Auto battling except the last hard
[03:41:31] bosses literally with like nothing in
[03:41:33] the tree unlocked then I beat it on
[03:41:35] stream when fan came out and then I
[03:41:39] don't even need like the hard you can't
[03:41:41] you can't I did beat
[03:41:56] it where there are people there is no
[03:41:59] pawn broker
[03:42:02] handan [ __ ] I did the draconic tear
[03:42:08] option
[03:42:14] [Applause]
[03:42:17] okay do we buy the
[03:42:21] battle

[03:42:38] fine
[03:42:50] bro just Farm um you just
[03:42:56] Farm chat in this team do you go bronia
[03:42:58] or paila I assume PA is better because
[03:43:00] you can debuff enemies so you debuff two
[03:43:01] at once instead of just buffing only one
[03:43:03] but Bron's Al also BRS both cuz you get
[03:43:05] CR you get a bunch of crit D to everyone
[03:43:08] and attack but I asse it's still paa
[03:43:12] right also more skill point
[03:43:24] efficient it's a lay line bro

[03:43:50] fer receive
[03:43:53] Divinity P's going to waste your skill
[03:43:54] points P doesn't need skill points the
[03:43:57] only reason you would use skill points
[03:43:58] on paila are for her E4 to like reduce
[03:44:01] ice if you want or uh to remove a buff
[03:44:05] from an
[03:44:05] enemy you don't need to spam it oh if
[03:44:08] you mean an auto battle then yeah oh
[03:44:10] yeah yeah for Auto Battle yeah Auto
[03:44:11] Battle yeah if that's what you meant I
[03:44:14] was just wondering like what the team

[03:50:17] memories of the past the energy will be
[03:50:19] the same as as

[03:50:47] sorry my alerts are off actually cuz I
[03:50:48] was recording
[03:50:49] something okay let's go back to doing
[03:50:51] what we wanted to do which is memory C
[03:50:55] 10 why your lone levels So Random I run
[03:50:58] out of mats a lot okay shut up it's I'm
[03:51:00] sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry it's just it
[03:51:03] look okay I look there most of them are
[03:51:06] 80 sometimes I run out and it is what it
[03:51:09] is okay it is what it
[03:51:15] is I actually couldn't see did I miss a
[03:51:18] Dono Quantum set on her 18 I said
[03:51:20] Quantum uh with the death
[03:51:25] Shredder I talked about
[03:51:27] it um I think it's going to be made into
[03:51:30] a second Channel video so I want to
[03:51:32] add that with Jing Leu despite normally
[03:51:37] running a Harmony and aing support with
[03:51:39] her you can also run a dual carry team
[03:51:41] with blade cuz they have Synergy cuz she
[03:51:43] eats his HP and then he's like and then
[03:51:45] he slices so it actually
[03:51:48] works also because blades teams only
[03:51:50] need like three units anyways same with
[03:51:52] her so well that's not really true but
[03:51:54] yeah so we're like having fun with this
[03:51:58] team and
[03:52:04] clar clar yep
[03:52:08] claraa
[03:52:28] okay okay Chad we're going to show the
[03:52:30] build one more time now what we're going
[03:52:31] to do we're going to do my 10 with her
[03:52:33] play on a standard team with BR paila
[03:52:35] and laa I want to do a double carry team
[03:52:37] too but maybe later
[03:52:40] uh since the last time we talked I did
[03:52:43] one 10 pull and got our L cone so I
[03:52:44] guess we're using it but it's S1 and
[03:52:47] she's e z okay I'm sorry it is what it
[03:52:49] is uh it's really good uh and this makes
[03:52:52] up for us not having the good TP so in
[03:52:54] STO is like viable it's okay but space
[03:52:57] stealing station or especially R arena
[03:52:59] is what I really recommend I just don't
[03:53:00] have a good R Arena so we are not using
[03:53:02] that we're using Coto with uh genius for
[03:53:05] the quantum Set uh which is really good
[03:53:06] with the death Shredder which we're
[03:53:07] going to be running and our pieces are
[03:53:09] pretty decent like this one's okay this
[03:53:11] one's good a lot of crit damage this one
[03:53:13] sucks honestly like we just have a main
[03:53:14] stat but it is what it is really good
[03:53:16] speed boots and then a good offset uh
[03:53:18] well in off ball and rope so yeah that's
[03:53:21] what we're going to do this is our our
[03:53:22] build boom boom boom and we get more
[03:53:23] crate obviously and we have speed uh let
[03:53:25] me make sure my br's slower than her she
[03:53:28] is um Can my set effect [ __ ] that
[03:53:32] up no we'll be
[03:53:37] fine
[03:53:40] probably want to do
[03:53:45] this I who else am I
[03:53:48] playing do you want to enter the
[03:53:50] Forgotten Hall do you want to enter the
[03:53:52] Forgotten Hall
[03:54:04] sorry you remind me of super TF take
[03:54:07] that back
[03:54:12] I mean that's not even an insult he's
[03:54:13] funny so it's fine take that back
[03:54:20] though
[03:54:22] uh okay we want to play our first half
[03:54:24] second half we want to play either Dan
[03:54:25] hung or blade
[03:54:28] um oh yeah we have lyones now wait we're
[03:54:31] [ __ ] Bing
[03:54:35] chilling the only thing is I don't like
[03:54:37] playing blade without bra
[03:54:39] but I mean we could do Den hung yeah
[03:54:40] let's just do D
[03:54:41] hung yeah bogers okay we'll do
[03:55:07] this
[03:55:11] what the [ __ ] is this do I not have a
[03:55:14] better flower I mean I guess it doesn't
[03:55:15] matter but why is my flower so
[03:55:20] bad
[03:55:27] whatever maybe I have to reduce my BR
[03:55:30] speed so she was slower than my um blade
[03:55:33] maybe that's why calling it a flower
[03:55:35] whatever same
[03:55:37] thing
[03:55:39] dude calling it head is weird I don't
[03:55:41] know I'm sorry my headpiece
[03:55:48] sorry your 101 speed blade shut up I for
[03:55:52] shut up okay uh this is good our last
[03:55:55] thought should be we should put Pella
[03:55:56] here let me make sure she's on the right
[03:55:58] light cone yes she is um let me make
[03:56:02] sure she doesn't randomly
[03:56:04] die do I need this
[03:56:07] no
[03:56:12] [Music]
[03:56:15] I don't want to level this because it's
[03:56:16] on a random ass set that no one cares
[03:56:17] about however
[03:56:22] um dude I don't have the right set look
[03:56:24] look look I don't have dude look attack
[03:56:27] attack speed and like you could go speed
[03:56:30] on her but I kind of I mean I probably
[03:56:31] should but I kind of don't
[03:56:37] care

[03:58:57] doesn't matter cuz we're not doing
[03:58:58] damage on her so we'll just give her
[03:58:59] like it doesn't matter if we don't have
[03:59:01] a set as long as she doesn't die and has

[04:01:13] whatever it is what it is okay so ignore
[04:01:16] our set effect this is actually fine now
[04:01:18] ideally we have Fleet of the
[04:01:21] Ageless but that is currently not
[04:01:24] available because we don't have an ER
[04:01:25] ageless
[04:01:26] rope um I should probably Force craft
[04:01:29] one with the modulating resin but
[04:01:32] instead I modulated modulate resin to
[04:01:35] ice balls and they both sucked
[04:01:49] okay okay no more gearing let's
[04:01:55] go okay let's go all right these are
[04:01:58] memory C thems we're going to focus most

[04:02:03] we're trying to do that rhymed sorry
[04:02:06] that was weird Okay mer cast Tad we're
[04:02:08] going to use

[04:06:08] keep it moving let's keep it
[04:06:11] moving let me Mark a new time stamp so

[04:06:33] it use T instead of Bia B is better here
[04:06:36] ten is not bad too though T is pretty
[04:06:37] good too
[04:06:38] too here have com next to health bar is
[04:06:41] just a debuff enemy
[04:06:42] puts okay memory c stand H use all our
[04:06:45] Buffs boom boom and then Jing and then
[04:06:48] PE death
[04:06:49] sh we have a lot of we have a lot of
[04:06:52] death
[04:06:54] sh we have death ignore and we have
[04:06:56] death reduction and we have resistance
[04:06:58] reduction we have a lot don't get
[04:07:00] complacent okay we're going to hit this
[04:07:02] cuz
[04:07:03] whatever then we're going to reduce her
[04:07:05] ice
[04:07:06] res enemy data Secure net Mark activ
[04:07:10] time for a good old
[04:07:12] counter and then
[04:07:16] this
[04:07:17] nice use our skill again I'm not going
[04:07:20] to Al here cuz I want to get braia buff
[04:07:22] first I think that's probably good
[04:07:24] idea I don't have my Al though but
[04:07:26] whatever let me do
[04:07:28] this
[04:07:30] flame o 200 God
[04:07:34] damn uh I'll just hit in the middle
[04:07:39] dude holy
[04:07:43] [ __ ] what the
[04:07:45] [ __ ] certainly a character UHA time you
[04:07:51] H what do we do Loa doesn't matter I'll
[04:07:52] just hit
[04:07:54] him can I waste the skill point here I
[04:07:57] don't know if I use a skill point then
[04:07:59] jinglu has one but she can use her skill
[04:08:01] without consuming one then one then I go
[04:08:03] again but then I buff something that
[04:08:04] doesn't
[04:08:06] matter
[04:08:10] I don't know I don't feel like mathing
[04:08:12] right now uh I'm just going to assume
[04:08:14] that I can I'm just going to assume that
[04:08:15] I have enough skill points and if I
[04:08:16] don't then I will be proven
[04:08:18] wrong ble in hindsight I don't but we
[04:08:21] can Auto attack here it's
[04:08:27] fine you chose The Wrong
[04:08:30] Enemy okay okay pay for
[04:08:35] this that that that that
[04:08:44] oh yeah we scuffed our order I needed to
[04:08:46] save that skill point I think it's fine
[04:08:47] though I don't think we Al
[04:08:50] here enemy targets detected yeah I think
[04:08:53] this is
[04:08:54] fine I also don't think we could aled
[04:08:57] there but whatever Divinity leave it for
[04:08:59] your own skin math is not mthing yeah I
[04:09:01] need one more skill point I should have
[04:09:02] just not
[04:09:03] eat here we're fine though cuz we do
[04:09:06] this and then we have alt for next turn
[04:09:09] and then bronia goes and then we go yeah
[04:09:10] this is fine we're fine now we don't Al
[04:09:12] here
[04:09:13] though I think this is fine as long we
[04:09:15] don't die if we die randomly then it's
[04:09:17] not
[04:09:20] fine why not all cuz we 100% up time on
[04:09:22] BR our P does p could aled bronia
[04:09:24] shouldn't have cuz we don't want to
[04:09:26] waste it now we can
[04:09:27] Al okay do this we're going to get hit
[04:09:30] from the guy countering but I don't
[04:09:31] think my P is going to get one shot okay
[04:09:33] never mind we got fro he got
[04:09:35] Frozen to guard and defend CR them and
[04:09:39] this and then
[04:09:41] this
[04:09:48] unworthy Lun should be a lot of damage
[04:09:51] cuz now we're buffed
[04:09:52] 400 now they're vulnerable now they're
[04:09:56] dead okay I kind of wasted a turn
[04:09:59] setting up but literally as soon as we
[04:10:01] got the turn they died like I don't know
[04:10:03] I don't know I don't know I think troter
[04:10:04] takes extra damage but like dude what
[04:10:07] the
[04:10:08] [ __ ] like I wasted a turn setting up but
[04:10:11] like as soon as we had it they just
[04:10:17] died
[04:10:21] yeah keep in mind though we have paa
[04:10:24] defense reduction ice resistance
[04:10:27] reduction BR alt Bron skill her ly cone
[04:10:32] and the quantum set and um
[04:10:38] Trotter debuff thing on both ends was
[04:10:42] there something else Lyon I said Lyon oh

[04:10:47] good day for service uh
[04:10:50] Bron's aila's Lyon is silver wolfes it's
[04:10:53] not the defense reduction one I don't
[04:10:54] think right I'm pretty sure pretty sure
[04:10:58] on I don't think we have the ins
[04:11:03] Lon I think so I could be wrong we can
[04:11:05] check but I'm pretty sure
[04:11:13] no ions no you're an idolon sorry sorry

[04:15:07] all right we just Auto this that was
[04:15:08] easy holy
[04:15:13] [ __ ] what can free play do if they have
[04:15:16] inor Lun and Jing
[04:15:17] Leu
[04:15:20] uh
[04:15:23] cry no you could do you can do so in
[04:15:27] Lune has pretty easy teams Ting Yun and
[04:15:31] then a Healer that's skill point
[04:15:33] efficient which I guess isn't free to
[04:15:35] play yeah you're [ __ ] no you're [ __ ]
[04:15:37] F no but no no but you can do like tting
[04:15:39] Yun you probably want to save paila for
[04:15:41] your
[04:15:42] um you want to save pea for your other
[04:15:45] team probably not in B like you probably
[04:15:47] would pilo with um
[04:15:54] jinglu there you go M 10 we beat that in
[04:15:56] like no Cycles at all very easily uh to
[04:16:00] answer that question you'd probably do
[04:16:02] like I don't know actually so this team
[04:16:05] would want
[04:16:08] her I mean okay it depends what Harmony
[04:16:11] supports you have cuz like I've seen
[04:16:13] people make yukong work with him I've
[04:16:14] seen people make like you can do
[04:16:16] ASA uh like you really want bronia if
[04:16:19] you have BR you do this and then you're
[04:16:21] chilling you do like this and you're
[04:16:23] chilling if you don't have BR it's a bit
[04:16:24] more copium but you could do
[04:16:26] like this the hard part of emiter that's
[04:16:29] like not freetop play friendly is that
[04:16:30] you kind of want like the difference
[04:16:33] between Lua and Natasha is Lua will heal
[04:16:37] you without using any skill points
[04:16:38] Natasha has to so like it's a lot harder
[04:16:44] um it's more
[04:16:48] annoying Al also links now if you have
[04:16:53] her um
[04:16:57] yeah that's why I try to summarize my
[04:16:59] team comps in both Star andin as the
[04:17:01] roles they are so that's why I say
[04:17:03] something in Star like you go jinglu
[04:17:05] Harmony nil healer or shield and then
[04:17:08] with genin I'll say like you know dendro
[04:17:10] Hydro Electro cuz it's like a lot easier
[04:17:13] cuz I don't know every [ __ ] character
[04:17:14] you have right so it's like easier to go
[04:17:16] like that obviously there's some
[04:17:17] harmonies that are better than others
[04:17:18] but like usually it's like a same
[04:17:29] formula push jingle silver br oh if you
[04:17:32] have all four of them you're
[04:17:34] chilling oh that's you're ask should
[04:17:36] that be like like for one team yeah that
[04:17:38] works that works if you're playing
[04:17:40] bronia with emor make sure you speed
[04:17:42] tune accordingly so that you can do like
[04:17:43] Auto attack on bronia uh no sorry sorry
[04:17:46] sorry not BR Auto attack on emiter then
[04:17:48] you then it's BR and then BR skills and
[04:17:50] then he goes again and then he's buffed
[04:17:51] and he does a three thing just make sure
[04:17:53] you're like speed tuning for that it's
[04:17:55] not hard just one speed
[04:17:59] less why did we dude nine took us like
[04:18:02] two tries and we just insta autoed
[04:18:04] [ __ ]
[04:18:05] 10
[04:18:07] okay cuz we didn't have our Lon though
[04:18:08] cuz like I I had to share my Lon with
[04:18:10] like six
[04:18:12] characters I'm going to claim these cuz
[04:18:14] I feel like I forgot to claim these last
[04:18:15] week I I genuinely don't remember
[04:18:17] clicking claim on all of these so I'm
[04:18:19] pretty sure I
[04:18:20] forgot 200 speed BR is the play yeah
[04:18:23] actually just [ __ ] loop
[04:18:30] around oh I have to do this wait I
[04:18:32] forgot this existed I should probably do
[04:18:34] this right I have not touched this
[04:18:48] um does four five stars in a teamwork
[04:18:51] yeah why
[04:18:58] not um so I want to use that merals 10
[04:19:01] clear for a video I think uh but I
[04:19:03] should probably do another cuz ioki held
[04:19:06] on to all my abilities for six
[04:19:12] years yeah also there's a thing where
[04:19:15] enemies of memal 10 take 30% more damage
[04:19:18] when a Trotter is dead so like it'll
[04:19:20] make the character seem a bit better but
[04:19:21] also memory Cal 10 is the hardest
[04:19:22] content in the game outside of swarm but
[04:19:24] swarm you get Buffs so it's like
[04:19:25] literally impossible to show guys a
[04:19:26] character without Buffs because they're
[04:19:27] part of the game so it is what it is
[04:19:29] okay cool it's 60% more yeah if you kill
[04:19:31] two trots it'll stack right yeah yeah it
[04:19:32] could be 60% more you're right so it is
[04:19:35] a lot more but like also I don't know
[04:19:37] how to like say it in an honest way like
[04:19:39] there's literally nowhere else you can
[04:19:40] test it I guess you could do the yeah
[04:19:43] the other the whatever that one's called
[04:19:45] the third
[04:19:46] one I guess you could do that I'd have
[04:19:49] to unlock it
[04:19:52] though do I want
[04:19:55] to dude it's going to take a year is it
[04:19:58] actually
[04:20:03] harder maybe the place you gather
[04:20:06] material are you saying a lay line six
[04:20:08] is hard rest is easy not that
[04:20:13] hard I mean I can show it in like a
[04:20:15] random lay line if people care whatever
[04:20:17] we'll just do a random one I'll show
[04:20:28] it this against a random lay Line This
[04:20:30] doesn't give me Buffs
[04:20:34] right we'll Remove blade from this
[04:20:44] okay these enemies are easy though like
[04:20:46] these enemies are a joke but
[04:20:48] whatever tedious dude I feel like it's
[04:20:50] so much
[04:20:51] energy good
[04:20:54] counter wait these are going to die to
[04:20:56] my supports it's fine this this battle
[04:20:58] is UN me your strength R we've entered
[04:21:02] the storm to guard and defend them could
[04:21:05] do a boss too
[04:21:07] the skill is going to do nothing but
[04:21:08] then the next
[04:21:10] one but now bronia Buff's gone
[04:21:13] right I mean still though I don't really
[04:21:16] know like there's not much we can do
[04:21:17] here going Auto it I guess no stop using
[04:21:20] I'm sorry I'm sorry now I don't I mean I
[04:21:22] don't need the skill point it's fine
[04:21:24] ready for death now we're buffed and we
[04:21:25] do this and then this and like you know
[04:21:28] all will be re but these enemies are
[04:21:30] easy so lunar
[04:21:34] flame uh yeah I don't like doing it
[04:21:38] here could do a boss with oh a weekly
[04:21:40] boss you mean we could do a weekly boss
[04:21:42] that's not a bad
[04:21:49] idea which one which one's the best

[04:33:43] lra and fushan and we just go full
[04:33:45] defense I'm not even kidding by the way
[04:33:49] but we could do something different we
[04:33:51] could do
[04:33:52] Pella and like Baldi maybe we could do
[04:33:55] like this
[04:34:00] too get new material Drake refilled my
[04:34:03] resin and looking looking is not even a
[04:34:04] joke
[04:34:07] we just take sometimes we take small
[04:34:09] breaks to look at certain people
[04:34:11] characters
[04:34:12] respectfully just is what it
[04:34:31] is um okay I really enjoy doing
[04:34:34] destruction runs I think they're very
[04:34:35] fun cuz you farm
[04:34:37] Elites and then you're pogging and I
[04:34:40] beat swarm 5
[04:34:43] twice in like three tries with
[04:34:47] destruction but I haven't done any other
[04:34:48] runs and I'm pretty sure remembrance is
[04:34:50] [ __ ] broken so we could also do
[04:34:51] remembrance with her cuz she's a ice
[04:34:54] character so we could remembrance
[04:34:55] probably uh I don't know what I'd rather
[04:35:04] do
[04:35:06] what do you think chat should we do
[04:35:07] remembrance or
[04:35:08] destruction if I remembrance I think I
[04:35:10] benched
[04:35:11] [Music]
[04:35:13] laa I mean not which uh
[04:35:16] blade remembrance
[04:35:18] remembrance
[04:35:23] [Music]
[04:35:28] destruction oh wait should I do chat do
[04:35:30] you think I should do
[04:35:34] uh
[04:35:39] fine I'm a perfectionist fine fine fine
[04:35:41] fine fine no one in chat said this at
[04:35:43] all but I just got an idea and I'm going
[04:35:45] to do
[04:35:46] it okay wait do you want to enter the
[04:35:50] Forgotten no one in chat said anything
[04:35:52] but I just got an idea I think we should
[04:35:54] also do a quick uh a quick other memory
[04:35:59] chaos 10 clear but this time we can use
[04:36:02] the same team
[04:36:04] but
[04:36:05] we use a free to playay option which
[04:36:07] isn't even S5 so it could be better free
[04:36:09] to play option too just to you know see
[04:36:11] if we're getting carried by the Light
[04:36:12] cone obviously the the damage buff here
[04:36:13] is still the damage buff but might as
[04:36:15] well not S5 on dude I hit
[04:36:24] sorry sorry
[04:36:28] taste the lone could be better let's
[04:36:30] just do the same thing the
[04:36:33] moon same one run
[04:36:36] I mean we can also use like T or
[04:36:37] something but whatever I just I don't
[04:36:39] know this is like the most popular team
[04:36:40] so don't get
[04:36:46] complacent enemy data secure netk time
[04:36:49] for good old
[04:36:55] counter I mean we could do we could do
[04:36:57] Ting Yun and like we need
[04:37:03] paila T probably does the exact same
[04:37:05] thing except it takes you an extra
[04:37:08] turn all okay fine not a bad take not a
[04:37:11] bad take we'll do
[04:37:13] it sure sure sure sure okay we'll do one
[04:37:15] more
[04:37:16] clear I yeah that's actually not a bad
[04:37:19] idea we'll use on the follow of neon
[04:37:21] which is Free Play Weapon S3 I should be
[04:37:23] S5 but don't talk about it and then
[04:37:25] instead of uh BR we'll use tting Yun
[04:37:27] however I'm not going to level a new
[04:37:28] healer so we're just going to do tun
[04:37:30] pail and then just the probably we could
[04:37:32] use fan but I don't know I like having a
[04:37:34] heer more than a shielder with her
[04:37:36] that's just me
[04:37:39] though and my lyx is level two so s Co

[04:41:53] up we kind of messed up the order a
[04:41:56] little but it's okay I didn't like
[04:41:58] misplay I just could have done better so
[04:41:59] I guess that is the definition of a
[04:42:01] misplay whatever don't talk to me
[04:42:03] chat
[04:42:06] don't talk to me chat okay there should
[04:42:08] be they should be dead we have like two
[04:42:09] alss that are like right about to come
[04:42:10] up so it's going to be less damage than
[04:42:11] it should be but they're still dead and
[04:42:13] now we would like defense Tre and stuff
[04:42:15] but it's
[04:42:17] over yeah so there you go obviously the
[04:42:20] WRA is not free to play but other than
[04:42:21] that like pretty good run and that was
[04:42:24] with I can show you before we before we
[04:42:26] before we uh move on that was with S3
[04:42:29] Aon only and then we used uh Ting
[04:42:32] Yun who's on uh this like con she should
[04:42:35] be on like meshing cogs in this build
[04:42:36] cuz I'm like on an energy build but
[04:42:37] whatever we don't talk about it and then
[04:42:39] I'm on uh who else is am I playing I'm
[04:42:41] playing a Pila and my Pila is on
[04:42:43] literally so the the free event lone and
[04:42:45] then terrible relics we don't even talk
[04:42:47] about it and then my Loa well my Loa is
[04:42:50] pretty good geared but yeah I mean it's
[04:42:51] kind of just whatever
[04:42:55] yeah there you go pretty crack
[04:43:03] unit pretty C
[04:43:06] unit let me time stamp
[04:43:15] that I'm live for 4 hours 40 she sure
[04:43:25] sorry okay I I want to I don't
[04:43:29] know what is this oh the weekly
[04:43:33] boss
[04:43:37] where's the Swarm it's here boom
[04:43:45] boom okay I'm going to unmute alerts for
[04:43:48] now so sorry if I missed
[04:43:52] any I just didn't want to know all I was
[04:43:54] recording stuff okay uh we're going to
[04:43:56] play we're going to do a remembrance run
[04:43:59] okay I like this structure it's the most
[04:44:01] fun but remembrance is cool and is
[04:44:04] broken and we haven't tried it at all
[04:44:06] yet so I might misplay but it looks
[04:44:07] broken so we're going to do it what
[04:44:09] should we combo remembrance with like
[04:44:13] preservation with with uh destruction I
[04:44:15] combo with preservation I don't know
[04:44:16] what to combo with remembrance but we
[04:44:18] can look we're going to do
[04:44:20] BR p and Loa I
[04:44:24] think and then we'll download some other
[04:44:29] characters chat remembers the
[04:44:31] destruction we don't have swarm path
[04:44:32] unlocked by the way so this is going to
[04:44:33] be like actually hard mode we might fail
[04:44:35] who knows I use remembrance plus
[04:44:38] [Music]
[04:44:46] nil new code I'll read it after I won't
[04:44:48] forget
[04:44:52] trust destruction could be fun is
[04:44:54] destruction fun with her I mean we could
[04:44:57] do her and blade
[04:44:59] destruction bro has unlock propagation
[04:45:01] propagation is easy mode
[04:45:03] though should we do her and
[04:45:11] blade
[04:45:14] yep that sounds fun okay let's do
[04:45:17] it P or bronia chat I'm thinking Pila
[04:45:31] but all right let's do a double carry
[04:45:33] run this might fail we might might
[04:45:34] actually lose okay if we lose it is what
[04:45:36] it is but I think this could work
[04:45:38] destruction uh I kind of want to do
[04:45:39] remebrance Rememberance seems broken but
[04:45:41] whatever let's do destruction cuz it's
[04:45:50] fun all right let's go Wing
[04:45:52] flap wow I love flapping my wings what
[04:45:55] the [ __ ] is wrong with you okay uh looks
[04:45:58] like we're going to path upwards get the
[04:46:00] Trotter and then maybe path
[04:46:03] down
[04:46:04] easy curio CUO is a Gamba but I think
[04:46:06] it'll
[04:46:10] work okay technique damage is useless I
[04:46:12] I think I think the tooth is lowkey
[04:46:14] underrated uh record is pretty
[04:46:21] decent I mean it's okay right I don't
[04:46:25] like it but I I acknowledge that it can
[04:46:27] be
[04:46:29] fine tooth is not good okay listen I
[04:46:32] don't think to listen here's my take I
[04:46:34] don't think tooth is good but if you
[04:46:36] even get one legendary of the of the of
[04:46:39] the destruction reroll it can be pretty
[04:46:41] POG and cuz the destruction Buffs are
[04:46:43] good and you can get one where you deal
[04:46:45] more damage to a boss right before you
[04:46:47] go into the last boss or whatever boss
[04:46:48] with the floor which actually can save
[04:46:50] your life sometimes so I know it's not
[04:46:52] like the best curio but it can actually
[04:46:54] be okay in my in my
[04:46:57] experience I use it in the some of the
[04:46:59] runs I
[04:47:01] cleared I think they're all kind of
[04:47:02] whatever though
[04:47:04] like these two are probably the
[04:47:08] best H let's get it
[04:47:10] whatever I don't know I like it I've
[04:47:13] only heard people say it's bad but like
[04:47:14] in my experience I it's pretty
[04:47:18] okay this world five yes one five it's
[04:47:21] also fun cuz Gamba
[04:47:28] true uh break efficiency is really good
[04:47:31] as a supportive one we're going to take
[04:47:32] that that's like one of of the best
[04:47:34] supportive
[04:47:35] ones what is this dog
[04:47:41] wolf I never find myself using it off
[04:47:44] fair you chose The Wrong Enemy thoughts
[04:47:47] on arti caka but not like a normal Kaka
[04:47:51] like
[04:47:52] cocka also he's literally the cocka no
[04:47:54] the just [ __ ]
[04:47:57] mode sa it for your own skin I'll see
[04:47:59] you
[04:48:03] off
[04:48:04] enemy Target ready for
[04:48:09] another uh okay this is not I mean
[04:48:11] effect is actually decent yeah take that
[04:48:14] next ooh that's really good okay so far
[04:48:17] so good we want some good preservation
[04:48:20] ones too usually with destruction fun
[04:48:21] tip yeah like this this this this
[04:48:28] this would be like really good to have
[04:48:30] it for a
[04:48:31] boss this lasts for the whole fight
[04:48:33] right or is it just one turn I'm Prett
[04:48:34] sure it's the whole
[04:48:39] fight so like having a spare roll or
[04:48:42] like spare rerolls for the like bosses
[04:48:44] is pretty pretty
[04:48:47] nice spend 40 okay dude okay surely we
[04:48:52] can spend and and make the most out of
[04:48:54] it okay minus
[04:48:57] 40 random trans of attaining curio trans
[04:48:59] of attaining okay we are
[04:49:02] not
[04:49:05] last time we got a good one which means
[04:49:06] this time we're going to get a bad one
[04:49:08] that's how it works surely we're going
[04:49:09] to do the bottom
[04:49:11] one okay we can't go and get nothing if
[04:49:13] dude we we already
[04:49:15] in wait that's that's actually not bad
[04:49:18] we spent 80 Cosmic fragments on this
[04:49:21] which means as long as we get 80 back or
[04:49:23] even that's pretty easy that's actually
[04:49:26] good yeah wait that actually can be
[04:49:28] really good no we're leaving we're
[04:49:29] leaving
[04:49:30] goodbye Community
[04:49:32] device
[04:49:35] yeah this is really good enhance Beacon
[04:49:37] we take that can I put this here does it
[04:49:39] remove the
[04:49:44] Trotter chat does anyone know if I put
[04:49:46] it here does it does okay I'll put it
[04:49:48] here then cuz we can path there than
[04:49:49] there than there
[04:49:54] right I know that'll get reduce the
[04:49:56] countdown by one but I think reducing
[04:49:57] The Countdown by one for an elite is
[04:49:59] worth with destruction at least in my
[04:50:02] experience uh this the moon Shines on
[04:50:05] the
[04:50:10] truth wait why are they
[04:50:13] dead okay well uh I thought that was
[04:50:16] going to be a little bit more of a
[04:50:24] challenge stand
[04:50:29] down oh yeah the first four combat is
[04:50:32] true uh crit rate's not that great in
[04:50:36] our team actually because we have a lot
[04:50:38] speed is okay I actually don't like
[04:50:41] these and I usually I'm fine with hunt
[04:50:42] blessings we're going to reset it o oh
[04:50:45] wait this is really good though eject
[04:50:48] the Bison is good
[04:50:53] uh pretty sure you can't pass level five
[04:50:55] we passed five
[04:50:57] twice does this
[04:51:02] work
[04:51:05] I'm not I just do
[04:51:13] this eject the borison or eject the
[04:51:16] Ron this is so good this is like the
[04:51:18] best this is so good this is so good
[04:51:20] this is so good sorry this is so good
[04:51:21] and then when you upgrade itus 50%
[04:51:23] damage you take boom GG we
[04:51:25] win it can mess up fwan a little but
[04:51:27] even with hers it's can still be good if
[04:51:29] you upgrade it uh lower than 50 that
[04:51:32] could be good what is this one no we
[04:51:33] don't want that okay boom Sentinel
[04:51:35] satellite and we get n Nook Okay cool so
[04:51:38] far so good communing
[04:51:41] device what do we get enhanced Beacon
[04:51:44] okay again wait we get double enhanced
[04:51:46] beacons should I do it for the normal
[04:51:47] one or the other Elite I think we're
[04:51:48] going to path diagonal down so we could
[04:51:50] just do Elite enhance Elite enhance
[04:51:57] true oh that's
[04:52:00] good uh yeah I mean sure it's not the
[04:52:04] best but it's
[04:52:10] okay is 36 good on Jing that's what I
[04:52:13] can get on her yeah you add 50 right so
[04:52:15] 36 plus 50 you're chilling that is
[04:52:19] 86 wait I actually have to use abilities
[04:52:22] now should I Auto Battle little Auto
[04:52:27] Battle net markable time for a good old
[04:52:31] counter the Dead return
[04:52:34] playing the game
[04:52:36] sad sorry
[04:52:40] flame savor it for I don't know what
[04:52:42] happened to
[04:52:44] me receive
[04:52:46] Divinity on I sh I'm going to
[04:52:49] alarid ready for
[04:52:57] another I'm so SED my P isn't E4 yet P
[04:52:59] E4 helps but think of it this way she's
[04:53:01] not E4 so you can save skill points
[04:53:05] okay what is this destruction we take
[04:53:15] it golden
[04:53:18] unlucky I'm going to save our R rolls
[04:53:20] though go here path downwards I think
[04:53:22] it's worth
[04:53:25] it analy the um
[04:53:32] this
[04:53:37] for
[04:53:39] counter we can play the game without
[04:53:41] playing the game yeah I mean we usually
[04:53:43] Auto Battle and then for bosses we focus
[04:53:45] up sometimes Elites too but looks like
[04:53:47] we're chilling like look at how much
[04:53:49] damage we're
[04:53:51] doing in lunar
[04:53:53] flame optimal way to play HSR dude I
[04:53:56] might launch genin I might I might start
[04:53:58] artifact
[04:54:01] farming receive to
[04:54:05] the Dead
[04:54:08] return don't worry it'll get hyped soon
[04:54:10] when we get to the bosses well plane two
[04:54:12] normally is hard plane one is kind of
[04:54:14] whatever plane two is where everything
[04:54:16] happens one is whatever three is usually
[04:54:18] like if you every time I've got into
[04:54:19] three I've cleared so it's usually like
[04:54:22] two that the magic
[04:54:23] happens J looks insane yes I'm very mad
[04:54:26] that I could make a full video but there
[04:54:28] will be other videos that are coming out
[04:54:29] about her like of mine
[04:54:32] good time for a good old counter
[04:54:40] attack okay ready for another net Mark
[04:54:43] AC time for a good old
[04:54:48] counter I'm free to play and won the
[04:54:50] 50/50 okay I'm not free to play and I
[04:54:52] got
[04:54:52] [Music]
[04:54:54] Bou congrats though love that for you
[04:54:57] happy for you fail to send
[04:55:02] you save for me dude what if
[04:55:04] hypothetically every time we touched I
[04:55:06] got that feeling and let's also say for
[04:55:09] the sake of arguing for the S of
[04:55:11] argument that every time we kissed I
[04:55:14] swear I could fly would it then be
[04:55:17] logical to assume that I would need want
[04:55:20] this to last need you by my
[04:55:26] side I know that's what I
[04:55:28] think sorry if I'm wrong though in lunar
[04:55:32] Flame
[04:55:35] was that a normal attack dude I don't
[04:55:36] know what Auto battle's doing okay I
[04:55:38] don't I don't know but we won this could
[04:55:41] be good now you might be like Duck what
[04:55:42] the [ __ ] you only have one preservation
[04:55:43] blessing but with my destruction runs I
[04:55:46] always like to go preservation as well
[04:55:47] makes it really easy so this could
[04:55:48] actually be good however this is an
[04:55:50] enhanced blessing so resetting could be
[04:55:51] smart here but I kind of want to take
[04:55:54] this cuz 8 time
[04:55:56] 9 that's a lot even if we get like five
[04:55:58] 8 * 5 is 40% that's a lot of
[04:56:02] Defense could be greedy though on
[04:56:06] reset I'm going to be
[04:56:08] greedy
[04:56:10] ooh okay this is good attack isn't that
[04:56:12] like needed on blade but it's nice for
[04:56:13] Jingle U so okay that's
[04:56:18] good oh we got two uh yeah cuz it's an
[04:56:21] elite this one is no these kind of suck
[04:56:25] I mean ice weakness is fine for but
[04:56:32] no
[04:56:33] so you're telling me in six blessings we
[04:56:36] got zero
[04:56:38] destructions zero preservations and
[04:56:41] nothing we
[04:56:43] want this is not bad though thundering
[04:56:45] Chariot is fine uh seal is a cute animal
[04:56:49] and then this one has sus in
[04:56:56] it we take this
[04:56:59] one uh this is the one we no this is the
[04:57:02] one we know like right all allies
[04:57:04] consume 40%
[04:57:10] yep golden unlucky all good we'll save
[04:57:13] our R rolls go
[04:57:20] down also chat as I said um literally in
[04:57:25] like after tomorrow I am flying to New
[04:57:27] York ComicCon so if any of you are there
[04:57:28] I will see you there I probably have to
[04:57:30] do like a tweet or something we'll see
[04:57:31] but that's that and then after I'll be
[04:57:33] back I'll be to stream and stuff I'll
[04:57:34] also stream over there but then I'll be
[04:57:36] back normal stuff cool then literally
[04:57:38] the weekend after is going to be
[04:57:38] twitchcon and if there's anything
[04:57:40] happening on twitchcon I might stream it
[04:57:41] on my channel so expect some random ass
[04:57:43] content I don't know what's going to
[04:57:45] happen and then after that uh for like
[04:57:47] the end of October and November will be
[04:57:48] normal I think that'll be around rli's
[04:57:50] release so I'm going to have to go fly
[04:57:52] back on Monday then instantly start
[04:57:53] recording rly it is what it is but once
[04:57:55] that happens then that happens and then

[05:06:40] know what the [ __ ] they're
[05:06:48] doing also blade realistically we
[05:06:51] probably shouldn't use blade until later
[05:06:53] like we should probably download him
[05:06:54] when we have more Buffs realistically
[05:06:57] but whatever we start with them uh these
[05:06:59] this is fine kind of don't want it

[05:07:36] technique you chose the
[05:07:51] wrong okay pause
[05:07:53] trap uh these are all
[05:07:56] good probably should go effect res but I
[05:07:59] kind want defense feel like it would
[05:08:01] help
[05:08:02] we also only have one cleanser though so
[05:08:04] effect is pretty good but we could we
[05:08:05] could download Bron if we need
[05:08:13] to thanks for the support let's settle
[05:08:16] this D these fights take [ __ ] six
[05:08:18] years at the
[05:08:20] start I'm going to Al just to get in the
[05:08:23] form L
[05:08:30] flame I will dispatch you
[05:08:33] no doesn't
[05:08:39] matter what it basic a jingl teams you
[05:08:42] run her
[05:08:44] with um what's it called usually Harmony
[05:08:48] nil healer but you can do some other
[05:08:51] stuff like I'm running her with blade
[05:08:53] too I really want a diagonal down here
[05:08:55] but if I do we're using so much of the
[05:08:57] countdown I think it's worth cuz okay
[05:08:58] dude we get Elite here we can also go
[05:09:00] down and but then we lose two Elites if
[05:09:02] we go down here we transac we lose to
[05:09:03] dude look at this Elite question mark
[05:09:05] Elite swarm Elite like how do we lose
[05:09:07] literally impossible to lose that run
[05:09:09] literally impossible to lose that run I
[05:09:11] am not even
[05:09:13] yoking if we lose that run you can call
[05:09:15] me
[05:09:17] bad I was trying to break the
[05:09:23] object receive
[05:09:28] Divinity net Mark activated time for
[05:09:31] good old counter
[05:09:34] Dead
[05:09:43] return the fight is
[05:09:51] set nothing
[05:10:01] Manger
[05:10:05] uh that is fine I
[05:10:16] guess this is
[05:10:18] terrible oh wait I griefed
[05:10:22] myself okay dude I griefed
[05:10:26] myself I wanted to do the elite we
[05:10:28] [ __ ] transformed it into a combat
[05:10:30] okay dude
[05:10:32] it's 4:00 a.m. I'm tired how would I
[05:10:34] know dude in okay there I why does that
[05:10:38] even happen who wants this who's ever
[05:10:40] use this [ __ ] thing ever it's so
[05:10:42] useless okay I whatever we should have
[05:10:46] [ __ ] if that was an elite we would have
[05:10:48] had an extra one whatever we can still
[05:10:50] win doesn't
[05:10:52] matter actually not my fault okay it is
[05:10:54] my fault that's entirely a skill issue
[05:10:57] but I'm upset about it so let me be
[05:10:58] upset about it uh we're going to take
[05:11:01] we're going to take a blessing
[05:11:04] okay well we should not have taken the
[05:11:12] blessing
[05:11:17] [ __ ] these are so bad
[05:11:21] dude minus one Elite I
[05:11:27] guess analyze the target
[05:11:30] before
[05:11:39] not your fault no it is my fault and
[05:11:40] that's what makes me sad for good old
[05:11:56] counter our damage is good taking a year
[05:11:59] though your end

[05:26:25] afraid fine we're
[05:26:28] fine Lord carrying us that's fine that's
[05:26:32] fine I think I should use a heal though
[05:26:33] just cuz yeah so we're going to
[05:26:36] heal ourselves
[05:26:42] boom I should I should have cled her I
[05:26:44] should have cled her I didn't know it's
[05:26:46] fine it's fine it's actually fine it's
[05:26:47] actually fine did the blessing came in
[05:26:48] CL I didn't want to take that blessing
[05:26:49] and it came in clutch hey
[05:26:59] hey
[05:27:03] oh my God L just field healed cuz wind
[05:27:05] shear does AE damage I'm pretty sure so
[05:27:06] we would have hit pea and she would have
[05:27:08] died but the [ __ ] lra field [ __ ]
[05:27:09] carried us I think we're fine I think
[05:27:12] we're actually we win now cuz L's field
[05:27:13] just Perma
[05:27:16] heals oh no it doesn't do AOE damage I
[05:27:18] lied I lied I lied it doesn't wait what
[05:27:20] does AOE it's not Winder which one does
[05:27:22] AOE I lied I don't know
[05:27:25] whatever this wait she might die here
[05:27:28] what are the odds she
[05:27:29] dies
[05:27:31] this dude um none okay but one time yeah
[05:27:34] okay maybe it was a different debuff I
[05:27:36] don't know something cuz one time it was
[05:27:37] like my friend's turn and then my friend
[05:27:39] died not my friend does that make
[05:27:42] sense it was like okay it was like it
[05:27:44] was like it's like her turn but then the
[05:27:45] other dude and
[05:27:49] then surely we don't
[05:27:53] take I'll see you off I don't have a
[05:27:57] skill
[05:27:59] point
[05:28:02] etal I don't have a skill points passive
[05:28:06] passive okay we got it we're we're fine
[05:28:08] we got our passive we're chilling never
[05:28:09] mind we had our
[05:28:11] passive doesn't need a skill
[05:28:13] point
[05:28:16] to
[05:28:19] supp okay I think we actually win here I
[05:28:22] really don't think we should have broad
[05:28:24] blade for the first plane I think he
[05:28:25] guys better the more blessings we have
[05:28:26] but for now dude we a wind shear
[05:28:28] literally did like okay dude what the
[05:28:34] [ __ ] it's fine boom and then we
[05:28:39] skill you are [ __ ] me it's fine it's
[05:28:43] fine it's
[05:28:45] fine we need to
[05:28:51] cleans chat let's talk okay let's talk I
[05:28:55] think personally me personally me
[05:28:56] personally I think putting two DPS for
[05:28:59] plane one of simulated Universe 5 swarm
[05:29:02] five I think me personally two DPSS for
[05:29:05] the first play is not the best idea okay
[05:29:07] that's my that's my that's my take okay
[05:29:10] that's my take that's my
[05:29:12] take that's my
[05:29:16] take that's my
[05:29:29] take
[05:29:33] you just suck no okay unironically even
[05:29:36] if our builds and our gameplay was
[05:29:38] different we probably like maybe we
[05:29:40] clear that but like it doesn't actually
[05:29:42] matter there's no re we didn't need more
[05:29:43] damage we just needed not two DPS two
[05:29:46] DPS is don't doesn't even help us
[05:29:49] there I think we need to
[05:29:53] sustain like if I alt at four and play
[05:29:55] perfectly I don't even think we
[05:29:59] win fix your sleep schedule yeah
[05:30:11] maybe but DN that is a
[05:30:15] tragedy that actually
[05:30:18] tragedy offline don't tell me what to
[05:30:24] do he's streaming and and retrying until
[05:30:27] topaz Banner what do you mean retrying I
[05:30:30] don't need to retry if I get a first try
[05:30:36] true do you want to enter the do you
[05:30:38] want to
[05:30:39] enter wait I want to do this how long

[05:30:59] five
[05:31:06] wait look what one sec 5 minutes 3 hours
[05:31:11] 15 no way right oh it's two halves for

[05:33:26] first of all [ __ ] you second of all it's
[05:33:29] the size of the knuckle not finger okay
[05:33:32] it's the size of the knuckle not
[05:33:35] finger my dad was like my dad once
[05:33:37] bought me like some random like like a
[05:33:39] black ring and he was like he like sized
[05:33:42] it for his pinky and it was still it was
[05:33:44] still too big for me GG
[05:33:47] whatever dude it's not my fault okay
[05:33:50] it's knuckle diff it's not the hands I
[05:33:52] have big hands is just Knuckles are
[05:33:58] small
[05:34:09] sure you
[05:34:11] do
[05:34:21] okay
[05:34:25] sorry so much more norble than the clips
[05:34:28] uh cuz we've been streaming for 5 and 1
[05:34:29] half hours
[05:34:31] and so like the more the longer I stream
[05:34:34] the more I'm like dead not cuz it's like
[05:34:37] I stream for too long but it's cuz it's
[05:34:38] like 3:00
[05:34:41] a.m. so I'm I'm like I'm I factory
[05:34:44] reseted is double
[05:34:55] speed time for
[05:34:58] a human
[05:35:13] creation do 24hour stream uh that would
[05:35:17] be difficult I know you did
[05:35:19] one
[05:35:21] flame that looked fun I would need too
[05:35:24] much
[05:35:28] caffeine I can only I don't know I I
[05:35:31] need dude the thing is like I don't know
[05:35:33] what the [ __ ] I would do I guess freet
[05:35:34] to play
[05:35:40] account lend me your strength Chad be
[05:35:43] honest okay let's say I have no life and
[05:35:45] I play genin all day every day all day
[05:35:48] non-stop how long do you think it could
[05:35:50] take from a new account to clearing
[05:35:53] floor2 I think like two weeks lend me
[05:35:57] your strength I guess it depends on RNG
[05:36:00] to guard and defend crush them
[05:36:04] but savor it for
[05:36:07] me I failed you could get so many Primos
[05:36:11] from exploring that you can guar
[05:36:13] basically guarantee the characters that
[05:36:15] are on the banner like the four stars
[05:36:17] and probably five star Z did it in four
[05:36:20] two
[05:36:21] weeks okay wait we were better than zff
[05:36:23] though but also at the time he did it at
[05:36:25] no no sh at the time he did it the abys
[05:36:27] was probably easier than now right
[05:36:29] obviously it's still impressive but I'm
[05:36:30] saying like I feel
[05:36:36] like you missing a bunch of characters
[05:36:38] Shang Ling's free as long as Bennett is
[05:36:40] on the
[05:36:40] banner you get Shang Ling Bennett Kaa
[05:36:43] that's reverse melt and then you can
[05:36:44] play hyper Bloom with like
[05:36:47] Barbara dendro MC and then you would
[05:36:49] need to pull Kookie or fishal and
[05:36:54] sucros so the banner would have to be
[05:36:56] good or you'd have to get
[05:36:58] lucky I mean that's also assuming no
[05:37:01] five stars whatever five star you get
[05:37:02] basically can carry a team assuming it's
[05:37:04] a good five
[05:37:08] star fastest 36s 6 days okay what what
[05:37:11] is the definition of fastest did they
[05:37:13] spend money or no is that free to play
[05:37:15] is that like free to play no life cuz
[05:37:16] I'm not I wouldn't do that if I'm
[05:37:28] spending freeo play but key Neu and
[05:37:34] Nita okay but bro I mean I guess it
[05:37:38] makes sense to weapon Banner if you're
[05:37:40] like speedrunning but like
[05:37:42] bro that is kind of
[05:37:46] cringe I
[05:37:51] mean maybe maybe that's the
[05:37:58] play why does it get have a speed
[05:38:00] running Community cuz no one wants to
[05:38:01] spend six days on a
[05:38:03] speedrun there is some like floor 12
[05:38:05] speedruns that happen I used to I floor
[05:38:08] 12 speed on the back when the abyss was
[05:38:10] like fun and then I did 12 through a sh
[05:38:12] 9 seconds but then now was just like ass
[05:38:14] wow I love resetting the PMA cuz he flew
[05:38:17] up
[05:38:28] XD
[05:38:38] okay I'm like
[05:38:39] lowkey too dadge to finish this I feel
[05:38:43] bad though cuz I wanted to I'll do it
[05:38:45] next
[05:38:46] stream okay with that said here's what's
[05:38:49] happening with Jing right okay in case
[05:38:50] you're wondering and you're like how
[05:38:51] should I build her there are two ways
[05:38:53] that I'm going to tell you how to
[05:38:54] Builder one we talked about it on stream
[05:38:56] that's going to be turned into a full
[05:38:58] video on the second Channel though cuz I
[05:38:59] don't upload it to the main channel of
[05:39:01] how to build her and how good she is and
[05:39:02] stuff and a clear of her and then for
[05:39:04] the main Channel while I normally would
[05:39:06] upload like a 20 minute guide I got
[05:39:08] [ __ ] by things out of my control so I
[05:39:10] can't but I'm uploading a short so it's
[05:39:11] going to be a short and then a video on
[05:39:12] the second Channel exclamation mark
[05:39:14] second however if you're wondering so
[05:39:16] that's what's going to happen and then
[05:39:17] for the next character I'll probably do
[05:39:18] a guide for now like a a longer one for
[05:39:21] now if you're wondering like oh we were
[05:39:23] on I was on this the whole I am tilted
[05:39:27] dude okay okay listen listen we did our
[05:39:30] whole swarm five with the wrong okay
[05:39:32] listen we would have won we would have
[05:39:33] cleared we actually would have cleared
[05:39:35] we actually would have cleared not even
[05:39:38] my fault we were on the wrong light
[05:39:46] cone dude dude we were okay whatever
[05:39:51] anyways anyways it happens if you're
[05:39:54] wondering how to build her L cone this
[05:39:56] is the best one second best is on the
[05:39:57] fall of an Aon which is free to play and
[05:39:59] then if you don't have that then just
[05:40:00] get it or you can use Arland lyone uh
[05:40:03] under the blue sky or any other five
[05:40:04] star like CL
[05:40:06] whatever traces you want skill and
[05:40:08] talent and then Al skill and talent are
[05:40:10] about as good Relic you want either ice
[05:40:13] or Quantum if you're running a death
[05:40:14] Shing support if which is actually
[05:40:16] better if you are uh but not by too much
[05:40:19] and then twopiece the the the the the
[05:40:21] the planner you want uh rud it if not
[05:40:25] space stealing if not you can go sub
[05:40:27] stats uh I'm using inert which is okay
[05:40:29] it's not great just because I don't have
[05:40:32] um a good
[05:40:34] rulin chat does anyone off the top of
[05:40:36] their head know the difference between
[05:40:37] inert and rudant I assume it's like 10%
[05:40:40] like eight or something five no more
[05:40:42] than five like 8 10 something like that
[05:40:45] oh
[05:40:48] no three there's no way it's three her
[05:40:51] alt isn't that
[05:40:58] good
[05:40:59] for Rog no idea well fair
[05:41:15] enough okay I'll check after after
[05:41:28] stre
[05:41:36] right we are't The Dread
[05:41:39] viewers
[05:41:43] okay 450 versus
[05:41:46] 470 I mean that's not that much
[05:41:49] right that's 20K out of
[05:41:58] 470
[05:42:02] why she on Quantum yeah she's Quantum
[05:42:03] Jing is quantum that's
[05:42:07] why no it's the de ignore you only want
[05:42:09] to do that if you're running um a
[05:42:12] defense reducing support like P silver
[05:42:13] wolf it's even better with her lyone and
[05:42:15] it's even better against Quantum weak
[05:42:17] enemies but even without
[05:42:20] it a solo Cal I see yeah I don't see the
[05:42:23] point of
[05:42:28] that
[05:42:29] next person is prime why do I think
[05:42:32] she's ice she is ice she is ice she
[05:42:35] is I'm sorry I'm not trying to I'm sorry
[05:42:38] she's ice you can just use both you can
[05:42:40] use the ice set but you can also use the
[05:42:41] quantum
[05:42:58] set see you next Pat I'm not streaming
[05:43:01] next patch I'll stream before then also
[05:43:06] uh yeah we gain you gained 50 crit rate
