[00:10:51] here oh my God this is worse oh my God
[00:10:54] oh my God oh my
[00:10:56] God bro what is this website
[00:11:02] it was fine okay sorry sorry sorry sorry
[00:11:04] okay dear traveler okay Dev update 075
[00:11:07] let's go the latest developer discussion
[00:11:09] has arrived we'll be introducing
[00:11:11] optimizations for 4.8 to improve your
[00:11:14] gaming experience in addition following
[00:11:16] the official launch of the new game mode
[00:11:18] Imaginarium theater we're also
[00:11:20] continuing to monitor The Travelers
[00:11:24] feedback okay let me say something I'm
[00:11:27] going to pause the music for this
[00:11:28] statement
[00:11:30] I'm going to read the next few
[00:11:31] paragraphs this might not be much and
[00:11:34] they might say this and then change
[00:11:35] nothing afterwards however it shows that
[00:11:38] they're allegedly are listening which is
[00:11:41] huge okay back to music the initial
[00:11:43] intention behind the design of theater
[00:11:45] was to provide Travelers with new and
[00:11:47] diverse combat experiences through the
[00:11:48] introduction of new scenarios however
[00:11:50] there are indeed various shortcomings in
[00:11:51] the current gameplay I agree with both
[00:11:53] of those statements particularly in the
[00:11:55] lack of sufficient positive feedback for
[00:11:58] different party lineups during battle
[00:12:01] true therefore in the upcoming
[00:12:02] adjustments we will continue to focus on
[00:12:04] Elemental reactions and consider
[00:12:06] designing more strategical strategically
[00:12:09] powerful and userfriendly mechanisms for
[00:12:11] everyone to consider furthermore that's
[00:12:14] a big word regarding the issue raised by
[00:12:16] many Travelers about the randomness of
[00:12:18] character acquisition a character to
[00:12:19] push specific character a mechanic to
[00:12:21] push specific character has already been
[00:12:22] implemented however as the effect of the
[00:12:24] mechanic remains at a subtle level the
[00:12:26] actual results [ __ ] you muting alerts
[00:12:28] the actual results are not ideal in
[00:12:30] future iterations we will also optimize
[00:12:32] the method of obtaining characters such
[00:12:34] as providing multiple options for
[00:12:35] players to choose
[00:12:37] from uh in certain instances of
[00:12:39] character acquisition okay this one I
[00:12:41] don't really care about but
[00:12:45] basically optimizing it optimizations
[00:12:48] for Imaginarium theater are currently
[00:12:49] under development and will continue to
[00:12:51] be implemented in subsequent updates we
[00:12:54] hope that these changes will provide
[00:12:56] Travelers with better gameplay
[00:12:57] experience we sincerely appreciate
[00:12:59] everyone's constructive feedback okay
[00:13:02] now I don't know if they actually care
[00:13:04] or are pretending to care probably the
[00:13:06] latter and not the former
[00:13:09] however changes the theaters a [ __ ] W
[00:13:12] because you already know my take on this
[00:13:14] new game mode new combat mode is a huge
[00:13:16] thing but there's a lot of shortcomings
[00:13:18] that I think need to be fixed true true
[00:13:20] ta ta so hopefully that happens
[00:13:24] um yeah so this is a a good start I mean
[00:13:27] it doesn't mean anything until we see
[00:13:28] what they change change but it is a good
[00:13:30] start it is a good start it is a good
[00:13:32] start it is a good start it is a good
[00:13:36] start
[00:13:38] um why are you in a Samsung
[00:13:43] fridge anyways it good start I hopefully
[00:13:47] I want it to be a like I want it to
[00:13:50] be this is going to sound like a cop
[00:13:53] take but I want it to be simultaneously
[00:13:55] a bit more accessible but also harder at
[00:13:57] for like Max like maybe you get like a
[00:13:59] bonus medal or some [ __ ] I don't [ __ ]
[00:14:00] know uh people would complain about that
[00:14:02] but like I don't care okay developer
[00:14:04] discussion dear traveler the latest
[00:14:06] developer discussion has arrived yep
[00:14:07] yeah we read that uh encounter points
[00:14:10] will be
[00:14:11] accumulated tab Travelers take even more
[00:14:13] control of their game time from 4.8
[00:14:15] onwards any excess encounter points you
[00:14:17] gain will be accumulated converted to
[00:14:19] longterm encounter points expend
[00:14:21] original resin through any means and you
[00:14:24] can convert long-term points back into
[00:14:26] daily points
[00:14:30] okay so this looks
[00:14:32] like this the star one's better but this
[00:14:35] is good because I for my understanding
[00:14:37] it means you do your dailies like you
[00:14:39] one day in the week one day in the month
[00:14:41] one day in the patch you do like dailies
[00:14:43] you explore you do Advance whatever you
[00:14:45] get encounter points and then for the
[00:14:46] other days all you need to do is log in
[00:14:48] and spend resin which I think is
[00:14:50] huge but I could be misunderstanding it
[00:14:53] but that sounds
[00:14:54] cool right how is the star one better
[00:14:57] well star all you do every day is just
[00:14:58] res resin wait this is better wait how
[00:15:01] am I misunderstanding cuz star rail
[00:15:02] every day all you do is you spend resin
[00:15:03] you don't need to do any other daily you
[00:15:05] just resin you're done this one is you
[00:15:07] do dailies one day and then the rest you
[00:15:09] just
[00:15:12] resin it's better wait why why why read
[00:15:14] it again okay sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[00:15:17] let me see uh long counter points spend
[00:15:21] resin you'll be able to convert longterm
[00:15:22] for every 30 resin you gain enough yeah
[00:15:25] okay yeah
[00:15:31] okay whatever it's good okay it doesn't
[00:15:32] matter it's good it's good listen hoyse
[00:15:35] took a page out of Hoover's book and
[00:15:37] they cooked twice okay okay anyways it
[00:15:39] doesn't matter I don't we don't need to
[00:15:40] compete okay they're good it's good POG
[00:15:43] 6.0 wait they just confirmed 6.0 okay
[00:15:45] cool oh this I saw this look caught I
[00:15:48] saw this one caught I saw bosses will
[00:15:51] respawn much faster in the new version
[00:15:55] the respawn time for bosses will be
[00:15:57] shorted into 10 seconds
[00:16:00] oh my God 10
[00:16:03] seconds I don't have to wait 2 minutes
[00:16:07] that's [ __ ] huge it should have been
[00:16:08] done six years ago but I don't care I'm
[00:16:10] [ __ ] happy I'm [ __ ] happy 10
[00:16:12] seconds
[00:16:16] 10 how do you feel
[00:16:18] Al 10 seconds is actually a pretty long
[00:16:22] time it's like above average actually
[00:16:25] kill you shut the [ __ ] up shut up shut
[00:16:28] up shut up good person shut the [ __ ] up
[00:16:30] sit down bro okay true though I do have

[00:20:10] optional difficulty decrease is fine
[00:20:12] like it helps casual players and for the
[00:20:15] rest of us no one cares so it's fine um
[00:20:18] I remember the clickbait videos of Don't
[00:20:20] Ascend Your World level uh to that I say
[00:20:23] skill issue but I mean this is fine to
[00:20:26] add now this is where I have a problem
[00:20:30] has genshin gone woke reducing the
[00:20:32] difficulty of monat domains hey man when
[00:20:35] I was young I had to [ __ ] I had seven
[00:20:37] years cool down on my child you don't
[00:20:39] [ __ ] know you don't know what I had
[00:20:40] to go through I'm kidding uh difficulty
[00:20:44] of certain domains in monat and Le has
[00:20:47] been
[00:20:49] adjusted uh I low key mentioned this
[00:20:51] like two streams ago because I thought
[00:20:52] it was official but it was a leak sorry
[00:20:55] sorry sorry don't don't unsp I mean I'm
[00:20:56] not sponsored today but don't don't
[00:20:58] don't sue me okay
[00:21:00] um yeah I didn't know if it was real I
[00:21:03] guess it is real to address this issue
[00:21:05] we have adjusted the layline disorders
[00:21:07] in some
[00:21:09] domains that's like five what the [ __ ]
[00:21:12] Cecilia Garden forsaken Rift hidden
[00:21:13] Palace of Joe formula domain of guun
[00:21:16] hidden Palace of lean Shan
[00:21:19] formula before adjustment your character
[00:21:22] okay thank you
[00:21:24] your your character will periodically
[00:21:26] inflict with slowing water greatly
[00:21:27] increasing your skills go down after
[00:21:29] adjustment 75% Electro damage bonus what
[00:21:33] the
[00:21:35] hell wait this is a lot I mean honestly
[00:21:39] I'm going to be honest I think there was
[00:21:41] no more annoying content in the game
[00:21:43] than monats hydro and cryo domains so
[00:21:46] I'm
[00:21:48] GL I literally feel like a boomer that's
[00:21:50] like you don't know what I had to suffer
[00:21:53] through but I'm glad that it's not like
[00:21:55] this anymore so POG less
[00:21:59] annoing but like it it makes me feel
[00:22:01] less relatable now in like 3 years when
[00:22:03] be talking about monat domains and no
[00:22:05] one's going to know what I'm dude you
[00:22:06] guys don't even know what prototype amus
[00:22:08] is they changed the [ __ ] name
[00:22:12] anyways in addition we also have made
[00:22:14] adjustments to the enemy types okay I
[00:22:16] mean that's kind of whatever they remove
[00:22:17] the hydr Mages and they put Hydro
[00:22:20] turs oh no they just remove the hydr
[00:22:22] Mages okay that's fine uh to save
[00:22:24] storage space on the device Travelers
[00:22:26] playing on mobile devices can use the
[00:22:28] past wait Past Quest Resource Management
[00:22:31] Past Quest Resource Management feature
[00:22:33] from the in-game setting resources
[00:22:35] screen to delete resources from
[00:22:37] completed quests have you ever tried
[00:22:39] this
[00:22:40] feature oh it's an old feature after the
[00:22:43] 4.8 update will it provide a onetime red
[00:22:45] dot prompt for people who have never
[00:22:47] used it wait I didn't even know this was
[00:22:49] a thing wait this is lit okay my bad
[00:22:53] mobile only okay
[00:22:58] oh well at least it's I mean it'd be
[00:23:01] cool on PC as well but at least it's a
[00:23:03] thing I guess I think that's cool though
[00:23:05] I didn't know that was a thing I gen I
[00:23:07] guess it's not new so I'm not going to
[00:23:08] react as though it's new but for me it's
[00:23:10] new so I'm reacting as if it's new
[00:23:11] that's cool because it means you can
[00:23:12] like your phone doesn't have to [ __ ]
[00:23:15] die because you could well it's still a
[00:23:16] lot of gigs but you can like remove old
[00:23:18] [ __ ] that's
[00:23:20] cool I do think they need it on PC I
[00:23:25] agree
[00:23:27] no only 20
[00:23:29] gigs dude on PC it's l it literally
[00:23:32] [ __ ] you I mean zenis also did so
[00:23:36] T
[00:23:37] um okay me personally you already know
[00:23:40] what I'm hype about I think the
[00:23:42] encounter stuff this is actually cool
[00:23:44] cuz I feel like there's some days I
[00:23:45] literally just don't want to play the
[00:23:46] game and just spend res and don't want
[00:23:48] to do dailies so this helps uh boss
[00:23:50] respawning faster is sick this Abyss
[00:23:52] thing is like very minimal I know most
[00:23:54] people won't care but to like the
[00:23:56] endgame try hard sweats that are doing
[00:23:57] Abyss 60 times S A Day testing different
[00:23:59] teams like me this is a [ __ ] like
[00:24:01] this this this adds up man it it saves
[00:24:03] my mental and then the dialogue screen
[00:24:06] is lit and all of those things are just
[00:24:09] quality of life the main thing that I
[00:24:10] think is really big is that they say hey
[00:24:13] we're listening to your feedback for
[00:24:14] imagin theater we know it's not perfect
[00:24:16] we're going to make changes the it could
[00:24:18] still be [ __ ] next patch it could still
[00:24:20] be [ __ ] int I mean I don't think it's
[00:24:21] like [ __ ] but like I think it does need
[00:24:23] anyways it could look it nothing might
[00:24:25] change it might get worse but the fact
[00:24:27] that they're like hey we're listening to
[00:24:28] it that's a w I told you they need to
[00:24:30] hire John gensin who pretends like they
[00:24:32] care for us okay okay
[00:24:35] okay I'm yelling anyways I think it's
[00:24:39] cool I think it's cool
[00:24:44] um
[00:24:51] yeah like like the thing with theater is
[00:24:53] it's in a weird Middle Ground where
[00:24:56] like you're not happy if you're
[00:24:59] like you're not happy if you're in like
[00:25:01] the the like not good extreme and you're
[00:25:04] not happy if you're in the like tryhard
[00:25:06] extreme because it won't be a challenge
[00:25:07] for I like it won't be a challenge or it
[00:25:09] won't be doable and then like the middle
[00:25:10] ground are like oh it's foggy but like
[00:25:13] it has to it has to like K like it it's
[00:25:16] kind of just like floating it's like in
[00:25:18] a weird like in the middle between easy
[00:25:22] and hard where it's just like you need a
[00:25:24] lot of characters but it's not like hard
[00:25:26] so I hope they either push it a bit more
[00:25:27] to simulate ated universe's direction or
[00:25:29] a bit more to like okay actually build
[00:25:31] your characters but it's a bit more
[00:25:34] exess we'll see I mean it might not be
[00:25:36] hard but I'm hard genin impact 4.8 Dev
[00:25:39] stream is starting soon uh overall I
[00:25:41] think this is a good Dev post
[00:25:44] um at least they're adding quality of
[00:25:46] life stuff and and [ __ ] so w hopefully
[00:25:48] we get artifact presets but it's not
[00:25:50] here

[00:41:23] fontaine's most renowned perfumers Emily
[00:41:27] woo oh Emily isn't just a great perfumer
[00:41:31] she's also a pharmacology and botney
[00:41:34] expert oh b means gardening that reminds
[00:41:37] me doesn't one of Chan's voice lines
[00:41:40] mention that Emily has a true profession
[00:41:42] and identity that stayed a mystery up
[00:41:44] till now we no once we've learned more
[00:41:47] about
[00:41:49] her oh after a meal AIDS digestion and
[00:41:53] increases blood circulation so would you
[00:41:56] like to
[00:41:59] joing physical normal attx no one cares
[00:42:03] not a
[00:42:06] catalyst
[00:42:08] neutralize that is a bloom oh my God
[00:42:13] num wait she just pulled up a catalyst
[00:42:15] what the [ __ ] is that dendro support
[00:42:17] dendro support oh my God burning oh my
[00:42:20] gosh she's so Secrets I love her shoes
[00:42:25] and did you see when she smelled the
[00:42:27] perfume oh my gosh I absolutely love
[00:42:29] that detail yes she's so elegant like
[00:42:32] just the way she one like equal one
[00:42:34] bloom beautiful
[00:42:36] yes I know right looks like Lisa's lamp
[00:42:40] Emily is the most renowned perfumer in
[00:42:42] Fontaine the new products reles usually
[00:42:46] sell out
[00:42:47] immediately almost so if you want to get
[00:42:50] your hands on one of for perfumes then
[00:42:52] be prepared to start lining up at 4: in
[00:42:54] the morning oh wo H Emily has another
[00:42:58] identity on top of her trade as a
[00:43:00] perfumer she's a forensic cleaner huh
[00:43:04] mhm she's the one who cleans up crime
[00:43:06] scenes after an investigation has been
[00:43:09] concluded she's a very experienced
[00:43:11] cleaner so she often picks up details
[00:43:14] and scraps of evidence that other people
[00:43:16] overlooked yeah okay yeah oh oh okay so
[00:43:20] she's kind of like a forensic examiner
[00:43:23] you know chevis mentioned it in one of
[00:43:25] her voice lines she said that Emily 's
[00:43:27] chemistry knowledge is super helpful for
[00:43:29] uncovering hidden Clues during
[00:43:30] investigations she can tell what type of
[00:43:32] perfume that someone wears and where
[00:43:34] they've been spending time wow that's so
[00:43:36] it all makes sense now oh this guy wears
[00:43:39] Dior Emily what does that how does that
[00:43:41] [ __ ] help explains how Emily and
[00:43:43] chevis got so close huh absolutely
[00:43:46] forensic cleaning is a lot more
[00:43:48] dangerous than creating perfumes Emily
[00:43:51] generally doesn't talk about her other
[00:43:53] identity in order to avoid retaliation
[00:43:55] from suspects so most people only know
[00:43:58] her as a famous
[00:44:00] perfumer probably been through all sorts
[00:44:02] of stressful situations from like
[00:44:04] highend venues to gruesome crime scenes
[00:44:08] o it must take a lot of mental toughness
[00:44:10] to handle all that yeah I'm pretty
[00:44:12] mentally tough exctly and her
[00:44:13] professional experiences contribute to
[00:44:16] her unique combat style oh let me p as a
[00:44:19] dendral pole arm user when she her
[00:44:22] element creates a lumad case that deals
[00:44:25] damage burning opponents that skill
[00:44:27] releases a really nice
[00:44:30] fragrance I know the lumid case is a
[00:44:33] creation that Emily is really proud of
[00:44:36] it fires Puffs ofro offield burning
[00:44:39] opponents periodically which deals
[00:44:41] dendro damage D offi when nearby
[00:44:43] opponents are affected by the burning
[00:44:45] reaction the lumid case will accumulate
[00:44:48] scents at
[00:44:49] intervals I know right after collecting
[00:44:53] two scents the lumid case will be
[00:44:55] upgraded
[00:44:59] particles that's might exra puff of
[00:45:02] can't tell the damage dealt by the puffs
[00:45:04] of Pur will also be increased only one
[00:45:09] created by Emily can exist at a time
[00:45:12] wait does that I mean it's pointless to
[00:45:14] collect scents once you've already
[00:45:15] reached level two though oh no not at
[00:45:18] all after Emily's passive Talent
[00:45:21] lingering fragrance has been unlocked
[00:45:23] the level
[00:45:24] two will release clear du that scales
[00:45:27] with every two cents collected the
[00:45:30] cologne will deal AOE dendro damage to
[00:45:33] nearby opponents AOE D so if I'm
[00:45:35] understanding this correctly only
[00:45:37] enemies under the burning status will
[00:45:39] create sents and the Damage scales with
[00:45:41] the number of sents collected by the L
[00:45:43] that's sick exactly a burning support
[00:45:45] she might work without burning we don't
[00:45:46] know like maybe you're just a good one
[00:45:48] of her specific talents Emily will deal
[00:45:50] greater damage to enemies under the
[00:45:52] burning condition and when a lumid case
[00:45:54] is on the field it increases the entire
[00:45:57] party's resistance to burning damage oh
[00:46:00] no if you're dying to burning skill I
[00:46:02] mean I guess it doesn't matter it
[00:46:03] doesn't matter so once you use her lumid
[00:46:06] case to apply gendro to your enemies you
[00:46:08] can use a pyro skill with a different
[00:46:10] character to trigger the burning
[00:46:12] condition uhhuh it
[00:46:14] matters in virgin you go you have to
[00:46:16] balance H so you're not dying after
[00:46:19] you've unleashed Emily's Elemental burst
[00:46:22] case will rise to level three and
[00:46:23] collect the existing lumid case on the
[00:46:26] field this fully upgraded lumid case
[00:46:29] will cause scented D to continuously
[00:46:31] descend onto nearby enemies dealing
[00:46:34] dendro damage when the level three lumid
[00:46:37] case leaves the F the are cool I like
[00:46:39] new lumid case will be created this case
[00:46:42] will be at the same level as the one she
[00:46:45] collected during her burst okay so if a
[00:46:47] level two lumid case is about to lead
[00:46:50] the field then you could unleash Emily's
[00:46:53] Elemental burst to reset its duration uh
[00:46:56] that way the level two lumus case will
[00:46:58] be able to spend even more time on the
[00:47:00] field cool works with burning at least
[00:47:01] she has a niche un like [ __ ] Siege it
[00:47:03] seems like you really figured out her
[00:47:05] kit but we should let Travelers
[00:47:07] experiment with for themselves okay I
[00:47:10] think I understand Emily a lot better
[00:47:11] now that we've learned about her skills
[00:47:13] she transforms scents into perfumes and
[00:47:15] leaves the world a cleaner place
[00:47:18] honestly SK perfectly combine her Talent
[00:47:21] both perer and forensic
[00:47:24] cleaner right exactly exactly okay great
[00:47:28] Emily is an expert with all kinds of
[00:47:30] sense no suspect can hope to remain in
[00:47:33] the shadows while Emily is on the case
[00:47:36] she always manages to discover the truth
[00:47:39] oo are we going to get the chance to see
[00:47:41] her forensic cleaner side please say yes
[00:47:45] please
[00:47:46] absolutely during Emily's story Quest
[00:47:49] the pomum de omra chapter Travelers will
[00:47:52] learn about the mysterious aose flower
[00:47:54] that has appeared in suu AUST Travelers
[00:47:57] will work with Emily to uncover a series
[00:47:59] of mysteries related to this flower and
[00:48:01] expose the truth once and for all what
[00:48:05] so
[00:48:06] exciting I love mysteries I know we'll
[00:48:09] have to leave travelers to uncover the
[00:48:11] details for themselves in the meantime I
[00:48:13] have some other information to share is

[00:56:26] your belief in me sure always the third
[00:56:30] gam play is called Metropole trials

[00:56:50] take part in these three events will
[00:56:51] earn star sale coins figurine
[00:56:54] fabrication Travelers can insert the
[00:56:56] into fantastic Fabricators to ear
[00:56:59] Keepsake figurines hopefully that makes
[00:57:01] it even easier for travelers to remember
[00:57:03] their Journey a what a cute origami
[00:57:07] hamster he's just a little guy wait what
[00:57:10] are these for do you keep them out
[00:57:11] teapot or is it just
[00:57:13] lost um after Travelers have used the
[00:57:17] Fantastical Fabricators enough times
[00:57:19] they'll be able to invite Kirara to
[00:57:21] their team and claim special rewards
[00:57:23] including Prima gemt furnishings oh and

[00:57:50] in store oh oh okay you've got perfect
[00:57:55] timing all right let's take a look at
[00:57:57] rest of the from W all right yes oh
[00:58:01] first up we're introducing the
[00:58:02] Imaginarium theater a once spank canvas
[00:58:05] has been sitting in a corner of the
[00:58:07] theater lobby but now vibrant colors
[00:58:10] have emerged on its surface this new
[00:58:13] permanent gameplay mode will launch in
[00:58:15] version 4.8 what isn't that ready
[00:58:17] theater five envisaged Echo challenges
[00:58:19] will become available in version 4.8
[00:58:22] each challenge will correspond to a
[00:58:23] designated
[00:58:25] character receive two keys of echo upon
[00:58:27] entering the challenge and each
[00:58:29] challenge requires two keys to unlock
[00:58:32] wait what if you complete the challenge
[00:58:34] then you'll be able to obtain the
[00:58:35] corresponding character's Echo cosmetic
[00:58:38] reward y yes and once you've equipped an
[00:58:42] echo onto its designated character
[00:58:44] they'll have a unique trailing effect
[00:58:46] while they're sprinting wait what the
[00:58:47] [ __ ] is it gosh e looks like flaming
[00:58:50] feathers that's so cool I to scam
[00:58:52] there's people sleeping but what the f
[00:58:53] etics
[00:58:56] honestly I feel like that's something
[00:58:57] that Hut would be super interested in
[00:59:00] right wait that's [ __ ] sick uh hold
[00:59:03] on question if we only start off with
[00:59:07] two keys that means we can only unlock
[00:59:11] One Challenge right are there any other
[00:59:14] ways to obtain those keys oh yeah of
[00:59:17] course Travelers can receive one key
[00:59:19] from each season of The Imaginarium more
[00:59:22] complete and finalize a combat
[00:59:24] performance in act six or higher
[00:59:26] oh okay so you can't unlock those Echo
[00:59:28] rewards in one go I know it took them
[00:59:30] like three years to add this but I'm
[00:59:32] telling you they start giving us and
[00:59:34] more cosmetic things no need to R they
[00:59:36] could make Cosmetics hard they might not
[00:59:38] but imagine if it's actually CU you're
[00:59:40] going to complain you can't get
[00:59:43] cosmetic get it going to have
[00:59:45] to LEL and friendship level requirements
[00:59:49] the participating character must be
[00:59:50] level 90 and their friendship level must
[00:59:53] be eight or higher oh my God that's test
[00:59:55] how well
[00:59:57] higher so frauds can't get it yeah I
[00:59:59] called you out you're a [ __ ] fraud
[01:00:01] the envisaged echo challenge doesn't
[01:00:03] just test how well you can use a
[01:00:04] character but also how well you
[01:00:06] understand their skills each challenge
[01:00:09] has specific obstacles and you'll only
[01:00:11] be able to pass if you fully Master the
[01:00:13] character skill mechanics that's awesome
[01:00:16] oh man I'm so excited so
[01:00:19] ready you can also look forward to a ton
[01:00:22] of events happening in
[01:00:24] Fontaine another video enthusiastic
[01:00:26] scholar in Maritime Harbor which allows
[01:00:29] travelers to play bing bang Finch ball
[01:00:31] thanks basima basima and Finch ball
[01:00:34] seems to remind me of something oh wait
[01:00:37] wasn't there also a basima in version
[01:00:39] 3.8 oh oh yeah oh that's right the
[01:00:44] basima we met last year was a hydro
[01:00:46] idolan replica of a human who once
[01:00:48] visited the valum Mirage five centuries
[01:00:50] ago she invented the earliest version of
[01:00:53] Finch ball the bosim Fontaine is her
[01:00:57] descendant wow that is such a neat
[01:01:00] connection yeah and since so much time
[01:01:03] has passed I'm guessing that we'll get
[01:01:04] to experience a new kind of Finch ball
[01:01:08] exactly Travelers will still need to
[01:01:10] launch Finch balls into Target zones in
[01:01:12] order to score points but these new
[01:01:14] stages will have rival Finch balls rival
[01:01:17] Finch balls will make it harder to score
[01:01:19] points so Travelers will need to
[01:01:21] strategize based on the situation in
[01:01:23] front of them ooh I like the new changes
[01:01:26] is I'm excited to try the new Finch ball
[01:01:28] and that's not the only new addition
[01:01:30] this version also has a co-op mode what
[01:01:34] so you can be each other's rival Finch
[01:01:36] balls
[01:01:38] yes Travelers uh can freely choose their
[01:01:41] level while they're in co-op mode each
[01:01:43] level has different terrain
[01:01:44] characteristics and types of Finch balls
[01:01:47] players will take turns launching Finch
[01:01:49] balls and the person with the most
[01:01:50] points after four rounds will win the
[01:01:52] match that sounds really fun no matter
[01:01:54] who wins or loses totally I mean look at
[01:01:58] these little guys look at the little
[01:01:59] fenes they're so cute
[01:02:02] a adorable oh and speaking of cuteness
[01:02:07] does everyone still remember asiri's
[01:02:09] photo taking commission no
[01:02:13] uh
[01:02:16] definitely Airi has made her way to
[01:02:18] Fontaine but this time her photo
[01:02:21] requirements aren't as strict Travelers
[01:02:23] can easily satisfy the commission
[01:02:25] requirements by submitting photos of
[01:02:26] their favorite characters an interval
[01:02:29] Tim mode has
[01:02:31] also character the perfect
[01:02:36] moment I'm so excited to see what all
[01:02:39] the master are going to come up with oh
[01:02:42] yeah we'll also have the opportunity to
[01:02:44] meet up withi and fontain and he's
[01:02:47] brought energy amplifier with brother
[01:02:50] wait wasn't hosi studying energy
[01:02:52] amplifiers in order to graduate oh does
[01:02:55] does does this mean that he still hasn't
[01:02:57] graduated oh no oh no I um I can't that
[01:03:02] I'm not American all right Mod's B that
[01:03:03] guy scientific research is filled with
[01:03:07] obstacles ire husse has integrated the
[01:03:11] energy amplifier with Fontan technology
[01:03:13] to create the hos amplifier and he'll
[01:03:17] need our help to test it out in combat
[01:03:19] listen if we can help him finally
[01:03:20] graduate I am definitely in yes please
[01:03:24] this would be the time I
[01:03:27] stage Travelers will need to form three
[01:03:29] parties to participate in three comat
[01:03:32] test is this each party member will
[01:03:35] provide a fixed amount of motive Force
[01:03:37] based on their character level motive
[01:03:39] force can be used to set up layline
[01:03:41] effectors which Grant Buffs in combat oh
[01:03:44] the same character can be assigned in
[01:03:46] multiple parties but repeating
[01:03:48] characters won't provide motive force in
[01:03:51] subsequent combat trials so you better
[01:03:54] keep that in mind while while you're
[01:03:56] forming your
[01:03:57] teams okay I get it so we need to make
[01:04:01] sure are you who's playing the game
[01:04:04] right now get me in a room with them get
[01:04:05] me in a room with them that way we can
[01:04:06] obtain a higher score just V bursted
[01:04:09] into hold e against a Ru grader figured
[01:04:11] all the buff slots for a single party
[01:04:13] you can also choose a buff to apply
[01:04:15] across all your parties all right
[01:04:17] Travelers will have to experiment to
[01:04:19] determine the best setup for them
[01:04:21] awesome okay is anyone else here excited
[01:04:24] about card games time to tweet perfect
[01:04:26] time to twe I'm excited about card

[01:05:06] stored oh Travelers won't have to worry
[01:05:09] about them going to waste anymore Dev
[01:05:11] developed this so how do we use the
[01:05:12] points that we've stored well Travelers
[01:05:14] can convert their long-term encounter
[01:05:16] points into daily encounter points by
[01:05:18] spending original farming that boss
[01:05:20] long-term encounter points will be reset
[01:05:22] during every version update that ends
[01:05:24] with z in other words the first update
[01:05:27] for a new region that means the first
[01:05:30] reset will occur in version 5.0 sweet oh
[01:05:34] nice you can spend them immediately yeah
[01:05:36] or you can save them for a rainy day
[01:05:38] that gives Travelers a lot more freedom
